The First of Peter 3:1-22 3 In the same way, you wives, be in subjection to your husbands, + so that if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a word through the conduct of their wives, + 2 because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct + together with deep respect. 3 Do not let your adornment be external—the braiding of hair and the wearing of gold ornaments + or fine clothing— 4 but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible adornment of the quiet and mild spirit, + which is of great value in the eyes of God. 5 For this is how the holy women of the past who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, subjecting themselves to their husbands, 6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. + And you have become her children, provided you continue doing good and do not give in to fear. + 7 You husbands, in the same way, continue dwelling with them according to knowledge. * Assign them honor + as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since they are also heirs with you + of the undeserved favor of life, in order for your prayers not to be hindered. 8 Finally, all of you have unity of mind, * + fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion, + and humility. + 9 Do not pay back injury for injury + or insult for insult. + Instead, repay with a blessing, + for you were called to this course, so that you might inherit a blessing. 10 For “whoever would love life and see good days must guard his tongue from bad + and his lips from speaking deception. 11 Let him turn away from what is bad + and do what is good; + let him seek peace and pursue it. + 12 For the eyes of Jehovah * are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their supplication, + but the face of Jehovah * is against those doing bad things.” + 13 Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? + 14 But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. + However, do not fear what they fear, * nor be disturbed. + 15 But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper + and deep respect. + 16 Maintain a good conscience, + so that in whatever way you are spoken against, those who speak against you may be put to shame + because of your good conduct as followers of Christ. + 17 For it is better to suffer because you are doing good, + if it is God’s will to allow it, than because you are doing evil. + 18 For Christ died once for all time for sins, + a righteous person for unrighteous ones, + in order to lead you to God. + He was put to death in the flesh + but made alive in the spirit. + 19 And in this state he went and preached to the spirits in prison, + 20 who had formerly been disobedient when God was patiently waiting * in Noah’s day, + while the ark was being constructed, + in which a few people, that is, eight souls, * were carried safely through the water. + 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, is also now saving you (not by the removing of the filth of the flesh, but by the request to God for a good conscience), + through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 22 He is at God’s right hand, + for he went to heaven, and angels and authorities and powers were made subject to him. + Footnotes ^ Or “showing them consideration; understanding them.” ^ Or “think in agreement.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or possibly, “do not fear their threats.” ^ Lit., “the patience of God was waiting.” ^ Or “persons.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
