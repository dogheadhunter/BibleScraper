Nehemiah 11:1-36 11 Now the princes of the people were living in Jerusalem; + but the rest of the people cast lots + to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine stayed in the other cities. 2 Moreover, the people blessed all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem. 3 And these are the heads of the province * who lived in Jerusalem. (The rest of Israel, the priests, the Levites, the temple servants, * + and the sons of the servants of Solʹo·mon, + lived in the other cities of Judah, each one in his own possession in his city. + 4 Also, there lived in Jerusalem some of the people of Judah and of Benjamin.)
