We will bring them to the house of our God, to the priests who minister at the house of our God. + 37 Also, the firstfruits of our coarse meal, + our contributions, the fruitage of every sort of tree, + new wine, and oil, + we should bring to the priests to the storerooms * of the house of our God, + along with the tenth * from our land to the Levites, + for the Levites are the ones who collect the tenths in all our agricultural cities. 38 And the priest, the son of Aaron, must be with the Levites when the Levites collect the tenth; and the Levites should offer up a tenth of the tenth to the house of our God, + to the rooms * of the storehouse. 39 For it is to the storerooms * that the Israelites and the sons of the Levites should bring the contribution + of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, + and that is where the utensils of the sanctuary are, as well as the priests who minister, the gatekeepers, and the singers. We will not neglect the house of our God. + Footnotes ^ Or “the Tirshatha,” a Persian title for a governor of a province. ^ Or “the Nethinim.” Lit., “the given ones.” ^ Or possibly, “all those old enough to understand.” ^ A shekel equaled 11.4 g (0.367 oz t).
