Nahum 1:1-15 1 A pronouncement against Ninʹe·veh: + The book of the vision of Naʹhum * the Elʹkosh·ite: 2 Jehovah is a God who requires exclusive devotion + and takes vengeance; Jehovah takes vengeance and is ready to express his wrath. + Jehovah takes vengeance against his foes, And he stores up wrath for his enemies. 3 Jehovah is slow to anger + and great in power, + But by no means will Jehovah hold back due punishment. + His path is in destructive wind and storm, And the clouds are the dust of his feet. + 4 He rebukes the sea, + and he dries it up; And he makes all the rivers run dry. + Baʹshan and Carʹmel wither, + And the blossoms of Lebʹa·non wither. 5 Mountains quake because of him, And the hills melt. + The earth will be in an upheaval because of his face, Along with the land and all those dwelling in it. + 6 Who can stand before his indignation? + And who can withstand the heat of his anger? + His wrath will be poured out like fire, And the rocks will be shattered because of him. 7 Jehovah is good, + a stronghold in the day of distress. + He is mindful of * those seeking refuge in him. + 8 With a sweeping flood he will make a complete extermination of her * place, And darkness will pursue his enemies. 9 What will you plot against Jehovah? He is causing a complete extermination. Distress will not arise a second time. + 10 For they are interwoven like thorns, And they are like those drunk with beer; * But they will be consumed like dry stubble. 11 From you will come one who plots evil against Jehovah, Giving worthless advice. 12 This is what Jehovah says: “Though they were at full strength and numerous, Even so they will be cut down and will pass away. * I have afflicted you, * but I will afflict you no more. 13 And now I will break his yoke bar from off you, + And I will tear your bonds in two. 14 Jehovah has commanded concerning you, * ‘Your name will not be perpetuated further. I will do away with the carved images and metal statues * from the house * of your gods. I will make a grave for you, because you are contemptible.’ 15 Look! On the mountains are the feet of one bringing good news, The one proclaiming peace. + Celebrate your festivals, + O Judah, pay your vows, For the worthless one will never pass through you again. He will be utterly destroyed.” Footnotes ^ Meaning “Comforter.” ^ Or “takes care of.” Lit., “knows.” ^ That is, Nineveh’s. ^ Or “wheat beer.” ^ Or possibly, “and he will pass through.” ^ That is, Judah. ^ That is, Assyria. ^ Or “molten statues.” ^ Or “temple.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
