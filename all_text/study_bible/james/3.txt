The Letter of James 3:1-18 3 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier * judgment. + 2 For we all stumble * many times. + If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able to bridle also his whole body. 3 If we put bridles in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we guide also their whole body. 4 Look also at ships: Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is inclined to go. 5 So, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it makes great brags. See how small a fire it takes to set a great forest ablaze! 6 The tongue is also a fire. + The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members, for it defiles all the body + and sets the whole course of life * on fire, and it is set on fire by Ge·henʹna. * 7 For every kind of wild animal and bird and reptile * and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humans. 8 But no human can tame the tongue. It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison. + 9 With it we praise Jehovah, * the Father, and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence “in the likeness of God.” + 10 Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, it is not right for things to happen this way. + 11 A spring does not cause the fresh * water and the bitter water to bubble out of the same opening, does it? 12 My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, or a grapevine figs, can it? + Neither can salt water produce fresh water. 13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him by his fine conduct demonstrate works performed with a mildness that comes from wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy + and contentiousness * + in your hearts, do not be bragging + and lying against the truth. 15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above; it is earthly, + animalistic, demonic. 16 For wherever there are jealousy and contentiousness, * there will also be disorder and every vile thing. + 17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, + then peaceable, + reasonable, + ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, + impartial, + not hypocritical. + 18 Moreover, the fruit of righteousness is sown in peaceful conditions + for * those who are making peace. + Footnotes ^ Or “stricter.” ^ Or “make mistakes.” ^ Lit., “the wheel of the birth (origin).” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “creeping thing.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Lit., “sweet.” ^ Or possibly, “selfish ambition.” ^ Or possibly, “selfish ambition.” ^ Or possibly, “by.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
