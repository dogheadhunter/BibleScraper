Amos 7:1-17 7 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! He formed a locust swarm when the late crop * was beginning to come up. This was the later crop after the king’s hay had been cut. 2 When the swarm finished eating up the vegetation of the land, I said: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please forgive! + How can Jacob survive? * For he is weak!” + 3 So Jehovah reconsidered * this. + “It will not happen,” Jehovah said. 4 This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah showed me: Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah called for a punishment by fire. It consumed the vast deep waters, and it consumed a portion of the land. 5 Then I said: “O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, please hold this back. + How can Jacob survive? * For he is weak!” + 6 So Jehovah reconsidered * this. + “That too will not happen,” the Sovereign Lord Jehovah said. 7 This is what he showed me: Look! Jehovah was standing on a wall made with a plumb line, * and there was a plumb line in his hand. 8 Then Jehovah said to me: “What do you see, Aʹmos?” So I said: “A plumb line.” Jehovah then said: “Here I am putting a plumb line among my people Israel. I will no longer pardon them. + 9 The high places of Isaac + will be desolated, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be devastated; + and I will come against the house of Jer·o·boʹam with a sword.” + 10 Am·a·ziʹah the priest of Bethʹel + sent this message to King Jer·o·boʹam + of Israel: “Aʹmos is conspiring against you right in the midst of the house of Israel. + The land cannot put up with all his words. + 11 For this is what Aʹmos says, ‘Jer·o·boʹam will die by the sword, and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.’” + 12 Am·a·ziʹah then said to Aʹmos: “O visionary, go, run away to the land of Judah, earn your bread * there, and there you may prophesy. + 13 But you must no longer prophesy at Bethʹel, + for it is the sanctuary of a king + and the house of a kingdom.” 14 Then Aʹmos answered Am·a·ziʹah: “I was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdsman, + and I took care of sycamore fig trees. * 15 But Jehovah took me away from following the flock, and Jehovah said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ + 16 So now hear the word of Jehovah: ‘You are saying, “Do not prophesy against Israel, + and do not preach + against the house of Isaac.” 17 Therefore this is what Jehovah says: “Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword. Your land will be apportioned out with a measuring line, and you yourself will die in an unclean land; and Israel will surely go into exile from its land.”’” + Footnotes ^ That is, during January and February. ^ Lit., “rise up?” ^ Or “felt regret over.” ^ Lit., “rise up?” ^ Or “felt regret over.” ^ Or “a plummet.” ^ Lit., “eat bread.” ^ Or “was a nipper of sycamore figs.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
