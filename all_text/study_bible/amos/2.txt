Amos 2:1-16 2 “This is what Jehovah says, ‘“For three revolts * of Moʹab, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because he burned the bones of the king of Eʹdom for lime. 2 So I will send a fire into Moʹab, And it will consume the fortified towers of Keʹri·oth; + Moʹab will die amid an uproar, With a war cry, with the sound of a horn. + 3 I will remove the ruler * from her midst And kill all her princes along with him,” + says Jehovah.’ 4 This is what Jehovah says, ‘For three revolts of Judah, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they rejected the law * of Jehovah, And because they did not keep his regulations; + But the same lies their forefathers followed have led them astray. + 5 So I will send a fire into Judah, And it will consume the fortified towers of Jerusalem.’ + 6 This is what Jehovah says, ‘For three revolts of Israel, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they sell the righteous for silver, And the poor for a pair of sandals. + 7 They trample the heads of the lowly into the dust of the earth, + And they block the path of the meek. + A man and his father have relations with the same girl, Profaning my holy name. 8 They stretch out next to every altar + on garments they seized as security for a loan; * + And the wine they drink at the house * of their gods was obtained from those they fined.’ 9 ‘But it was I who annihilated the Amʹor·ite before them, + Who was as tall as the cedars and as strong as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit above and his roots below. + 10 I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, + And I made you walk through the wilderness 40 years, + To take possession of the land of the Amʹor·ite. 11 I raised up some of your sons as prophets + And some of your young men as Nazʹi·rites. + Is this not so, O people of Israel?’ declares Jehovah. 12 ‘But you kept giving the Nazʹi·rites wine to drink, + And you commanded the prophets: “You must not prophesy.” + 13 So I will crush you in your place, Just as a wagon loaded with cut grain crushes what is under it. 14 The swift one will have no place to flee, + The strong one will not retain his power, And no warrior will escape with his life. * 15 The bowman will not stand his ground, The swift of foot will not escape, And the horseman will not escape with his life. * 16 Even the most courageous * among the warriors Will flee naked in that day,’ + declares Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Or “crimes.” ^ Lit., “judge.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Or “temple.” ^ Or “a pledge.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “those strong of heart.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
