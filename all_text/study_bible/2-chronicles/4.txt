The Second of Chronicles 4:1-22 4 Then he made the copper altar, + 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits high. 2 He made the Sea * + of cast metal. It was circular in shape, 10 cubits from brim to brim and 5 cubits high, and it took a measuring line 30 cubits long to encircle it. + 3 And there were ornamental gourds + under it, completely encircling it, ten to a cubit all around the Sea. The gourds were in two rows and were cast in one piece with it. 4 It stood on 12 bulls, + 3 facing north, 3 facing west, 3 facing south, and 3 facing east; and the Sea rested on them, and all their hindquarters were toward the center. 5 And its thickness was a handbreadth; * and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. The reservoir could hold * 3,000 bath measures. * 6 Further, he made ten basins for washing and put five to the right and five to the left. + They would rinse in them the things used for the burnt offering. + But the Sea was for the priests for washing. + 7 He then made ten lampstands of gold, + as specified, + and put them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left. + 8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right and five on the left; + and he made 100 golden bowls. 9 Then he made the courtyard + of the priests + and the great court * + and the doors for the court, and he overlaid their doors with copper. 10 And he placed the Sea on the right side, toward the southeast. + 11 Hiʹram also made the cans, the shovels, and the bowls. + So Hiʹram finished the work that he did for King Solʹo·mon on the house of the true God: + 12 the two pillars + and the bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the two pillars; the two networks + to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on top of the pillars; 13 the 400 pomegranates + for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowl-shaped capitals that were on the pillars; + 14 the ten carriages * and the ten basins on the carriages; + 15 the Sea and the 12 bulls beneath it; + 16 and the cans, the shovels, the forks, + and all their utensils Hiʹram-aʹbiv + made of polished copper for King Solʹo·mon for the house of Jehovah. 17 The king cast them in the district of the Jordan in the thick clay between Sucʹcoth + and Zerʹe·dah. 18 Solʹo·mon made all these utensils in great quantities; the weight of the copper was not ascertained. + 19 Solʹo·mon made all the utensils + for the house of the true God: the altar of gold; + the tables + with the showbread on them; + 20 the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold, + to burn before the innermost room according to the requirements; 21 and the blossoms, the lamps, and the snuffers, * of gold, the purest gold; 22 the extinguishers, the bowls, the cups, and the fire holders, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, its inner doors for the Most Holy, + and the doors of the house of the temple, of gold. + Footnotes ^ Or “reservoir.” ^ About 7.4 cm (2.9 in.).
