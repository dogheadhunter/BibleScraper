The Second of Chronicles 1:1-17 1 Solʹo·mon the son of David grew ever stronger in his kingship, and Jehovah his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. + 2 Solʹo·mon sent for all Israel, the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, the judges, and all the chieftains of all Israel, the heads of the paternal houses. 3 Then Solʹo·mon and all the congregation went to the high place at Gibʹe·on, + for that was where the tent of meeting of the true God was, which tent Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness. 4 However, David had brought the Ark of the true God up from Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim + to the place that David had prepared for it; he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. + 5 And the copper altar + that Bezʹal·el + the son of Uʹri the son of Hur had made had been put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solʹo·mon and the congregation would pray before it. * 6 Solʹo·mon now made offerings there before Jehovah, and he offered up 1,000 burnt offerings on the copper altar + of the tent of meeting. 7 That night God appeared to Solʹo·mon and said to him: “Ask what you would like me to give you.” + 8 At this Solʹo·mon said to God: “You have shown great loyal love toward my father David, + and you have made me king in his place. + 9 Now, O Jehovah God, let your promise to David my father prove faithful, + for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust particles of the earth. + 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge + to lead this people, * for who can possibly judge this great people of yours?” + 11 Then God said to Solʹo·mon: “Because this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches, and honor or for the death * of those hating you, nor have you asked for a long life, * but you have asked for wisdom and knowledge to judge my people over whom I have made you king, + 12 wisdom and knowledge will be given you; but I will also give you wealth and riches and honor such as no kings before you have had and none after you will have.” + 13 So Solʹo·mon came from the high place at Gibʹe·on, + from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel. 14 Solʹo·mon kept accumulating chariots and horses; * he had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses, * + and he kept them stationed in the chariot cities + and close by the king in Jerusalem. + 15 The king made the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as plentiful as the stones, + and cedarwood as plentiful as the sycamore trees in the She·pheʹlah. + 16 The horses of Solʹo·mon had been imported from Egypt, + and the company of the king’s merchants would obtain the horses in droves * for one price. + 17 Each chariot imported from Egypt cost 600 silver pieces, and a horse cost 150; in turn, they would export them to all the kings of the Hitʹtites and the kings of Syria.
