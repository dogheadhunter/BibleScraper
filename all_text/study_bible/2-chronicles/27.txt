The Second of Chronicles 27:1-9 27 Joʹtham + was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Je·ruʹshah the daughter of Zaʹdok. + 2 He kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Uz·ziʹah had done, + except that he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. + But the people were still acting ruinously. 3 He built the upper gate of Jehovah’s house, + and he did much building on the wall of Oʹphel. + 4 He also built cities + in the mountainous region of Judah, + and he built fortified places + and towers + in the wooded areas. 5 He waged war against the king of the Amʹmon·ites + and eventually prevailed against them, so that the Amʹmon·ites gave him in that year 100 silver talents, * 10,000 cor measures * of wheat, and 10,000 of barley. The Amʹmon·ites also paid this to him in the second and third years. + 6 So Joʹtham kept growing strong, for he established * his ways before Jehovah his God. 7 As for the rest of the history of Joʹtham, all his wars and his ways, it is written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah. + 8 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for 16 years in Jerusalem. + 9 Then Joʹtham was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him in the City of David. + And his son Aʹhaz became king in his place. + Footnotes ^ A talent equaled 34.2 kg (1,101 oz t).
