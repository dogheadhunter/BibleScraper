Joel 2:1-32 2 “Blow a horn in Zion! + Shout a war cry in my holy mountain. Let all the inhabitants of the land * tremble, For the day of Jehovah is coming! + It is near! 2 It is a day of darkness and gloom, + A day of clouds and thick gloom, + Like light of dawn spreading out on the mountains. There is a people numerous and mighty; + Never before has there been one like it, And never again will there be another Through the years of all generations. 3 Ahead of it a fire devours, And behind it a flame consumes. + The land ahead of it is like the garden of Eʹden, + But behind it is a desolate wilderness, And nothing can escape. 4 Its appearance is like the appearance of horses, And they run like warhorses. + 5 The sound is like that of chariots as they leap on the mountaintops, + Like the crackling of a blazing fire that consumes stubble. It is like a mighty people drawn up in battle formation. + 6 Because of them, peoples will be in anguish. Every face will grow flushed. 7 They charge like warriors, They scale a wall like soldiers, Each keeps to his own course, And they do not swerve from their paths. 8 They do not shove one another; Each man advances in his course. If the weapons * cause some to fall, The others do not break ranks. 9 Into the city they rush, on the wall they run. Onto the houses they climb, through the windows they enter like a thief. 10 Before them the land trembles and the heavens rock. Sun and moon have become dark, + And the stars have lost their brightness. 11 Jehovah will raise his voice before his army, + for his camp is very numerous. + For the one carrying out His word is mighty; For the day of Jehovah is great and very awe-inspiring. + Who can endure it?” + 12 “Yet even now,” declares Jehovah, “return to me with all your hearts, + With fasting + and weeping and wailing. 13 Rip apart your hearts, + and not your garments, + And return to Jehovah your God, For he is compassionate * and merciful, slow to anger + and abundant in loyal love, + And he will reconsider * the calamity. 14 Who knows whether he will turn back and reconsider * + And leave behind a blessing, A grain offering and a drink offering for Jehovah your God? 15 Blow a horn in Zion! Proclaim * a fast; call for a solemn assembly. + 16 Gather the people; sanctify the congregation. + Collect the old men; * gather the children and nursing infants. + Let the bridegroom go out from his inner chamber, and the bride from her bridal chamber. 17 Between the porch and the altar + Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep and say: ‘Do feel pity, O Jehovah, for your people; Do not make your inheritance an object of scorn, Letting the nations rule over them. Why should the peoples say, “Where is their God?”’ + 18 Then Jehovah will be zealous for his land And show compassion on his people. + 19 Jehovah will answer his people: ‘Here I am sending to you grain and new wine and oil, And you will be fully satisfied; + I will no longer make you a reproach among the nations. + 20 I will drive the northerner far away from you; I will disperse him to a dry and desolate wasteland, With his vanguard * toward the eastern sea * And his rear guard toward the western sea. * The foul smell from him will ascend, The stench from him will keep ascending; + For He will do great things.’ 21 Do not be afraid, O land. Be joyful and rejoice, for Jehovah will do great things. 22 Do not be afraid, you beasts of the field, For the pastures of the wilderness will become green, + And the trees will bear fruit; + The fig tree and the vine must give their full yield. + 23 You sons of Zion, be joyful and rejoice in Jehovah your God; + For he will give you the autumn rain in the right amount, And he will send upon you a downpour, The autumn rain and the spring rain, as before. + 24 The threshing floors will be full of pure grain, And the presses will overflow with new wine and oil. + 25 And I will make compensation to you for the years That the swarming locust, the unwinged locust, the voracious locust, and the devouring locust have eaten, My great army that I sent among you. + 26 You will surely eat to satisfaction, + And you will praise the name of Jehovah your God, + Who has done wonders in your behalf; My people will never again be put to shame. + 27 And you will have to know that I am in the midst of Israel + And that I am Jehovah your God + —there is no other! My people will never again be put to shame. 28 After that I will pour out my spirit + on every sort of flesh, And your sons and your daughters will prophesy, Your old men will dream dreams, And your young men will see visions. + 29 And even on my male slaves and female slaves I will pour out my spirit in those days. 30 And I will give wonders * in the heavens and on the earth, Blood and fire and columns of smoke. + 31 The sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood + Before the coming of the great and awe-inspiring day of Jehovah. + 32 And everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved; + For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, + just as Jehovah has said, The survivors whom Jehovah calls.” Footnotes ^ Or “earth.” ^ Or “missiles.” ^ Or “gracious.” ^ Or “feel regret over.” ^ Or “feel regret.” ^ Lit., “Sanctify.” ^ Or “the elders.” ^ Lit., “face.” ^ That is, the Dead Sea. ^ That is, the Mediterranean Sea. ^ Or “portents.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
