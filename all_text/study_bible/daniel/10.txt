Daniel 10:1-21 10 In the third year of King Cyrus + of Persia, a revelation was given to Daniel, who was called by the name Bel·te·shazʹzar; + and the message was true, and it was about a great conflict. And he understood the message and was given understanding about what he had seen. 2 In those days I, Daniel, had been mourning + for three full weeks. 3 I ate no rich food, and no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not put any oil on myself for three full weeks. 4 On the 24th day of the first month, while I was on the bank of the great river, the Tiʹgris, * + 5 I looked up and saw a man clothed in linen, + and around his waist was a belt of gold from Uʹphaz. 6 His body was like chrysʹo·lite, + his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and his feet looked like burnished copper, + and the sound of his words was like the sound of a multitude. 7 Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see the vision. + However, a great trembling seized them, and they ran away and hid. 8 Then I was left by myself, and when I saw this great vision, there was no power left in me and my dignified appearance left me and I lost all strength. + 9 Then I heard the sound of him speaking; but when I heard him speaking, I fell fast asleep with my face to the ground. + 10 But then a hand touched me, + and it stirred me to get up on my hands and knees. 11 Then he said to me: “O Daniel, you very precious * man, + give attention to the words that I am about to speak to you. Now stand up in your place, for I have been sent to you.” When he said this to me, I stood up, trembling. 12 He then said to me: “Do not be afraid, + O Daniel. Your words have been heard from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding and to humbling yourself before your God, and I have come because of your words. + 13 But the prince + of the royal realm of Persia stood in opposition to me for 21 days. But then Miʹcha·el, * + one of the foremost princes, * came to help me; and I remained there beside the kings of Persia. 14 I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days, + because it is a vision yet for the days to come.” + 15 Now when he spoke these words to me, I turned my face to the ground and became speechless. 16 Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, + and I opened my mouth and said to the one who stood in front of me: “My lord, I am shuddering because of the vision, and I have no strength. + 17 So how can my lord’s servant speak with my lord? + For now I have no strength, and there is no breath left in me.” + 18 The one who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me. + 19 Then he said: “Do not be afraid, + O very precious * man. + May you have peace. + Be strong, yes, be strong.” As he spoke with me I was strengthened and I said: “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” 20 Then he said: “Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will go back to fight with the prince of Persia. + When I leave, the prince of Greece will come. 21 However, I will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth. There is no one strongly supporting me in these things but Miʹcha·el, + your prince. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Hiddekel.” ^ Or “very desirable; highly esteemed.” ^ Or “a prince of the first rank.” ^ Meaning “Who Is Like God?” ^ Or “very desirable; highly esteemed.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
