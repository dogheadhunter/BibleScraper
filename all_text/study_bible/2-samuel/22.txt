The Second of Samuel 22:1-51 22 And David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song + in the day that Jehovah rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies + and out of Saul’s hand. + 2 He said: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold + and the One who rescues me. + 3 My God is my rock, + in whom I take refuge, My shield + and my horn * of salvation, * my secure refuge * + And my place to flee, + my savior; + you who save me from violence. 4 I call on Jehovah, who is worthy of praise, And I will be saved from my enemies. 5 The waves of death broke all around me; + Flash floods of worthless men terrified me. + 6 The ropes of the Grave * surrounded me; + The snares of death confronted me. + 7 In my distress I called on Jehovah, + To my God I kept calling. Then from his temple he heard my voice, And my cry for help reached his ears. + 8 Back and forth the earth began to shake and rock; + The foundations of the heavens trembled + And shook back and forth because he had been angered. + 9 Smoke ascended from his nostrils, And a consuming fire came from his mouth; + Glowing coals blazed from him. 10 He made the heavens bend as he descended, + And thick gloom was beneath his feet. + 11 He rode on a cherub + and came flying. He was visible on the wings of a spirit. * + 12 Then he put darkness around him as a shelter, + In dark waters and thick clouds. 13 From the brightness before him fiery coals blazed. 14 Then Jehovah began to thunder from heaven; + The Most High made his voice heard. + 15 He shot his arrows + and scattered them; Lightning, and he threw them into confusion. + 16 The bed of the sea became visible; + The foundations of the land were exposed by the rebuke of Jehovah, By the blast of the breath from his nostrils. + 17 He reached down from on high; He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters. + 18 He rescued me from my strong enemy, + From those hating me, who were stronger than I was. 19 They confronted me on the day of my disaster, + But Jehovah was my support. 20 He brought me out into a place of safety; * + He rescued me because he was pleased with me. + 21 Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness; + He repays me according to the innocence * of my hands. + 22 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And I have not wickedly abandoned my God. 23 All his judgments + are before me; I will not deviate from his statutes. + 24 I will remain blameless + before him, And I will keep myself from error. + 25 May Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness, + According to my innocence before him. + 26 With someone loyal you act in loyalty; + With the blameless, mighty man, you deal blamelessly; + 27 With the pure you show yourself pure, + But with the crooked you show yourself shrewd. * + 28 For you save those who are humble, + But your eyes are against the haughty, and you abase them. + 29 For you are my lamp, O Jehovah; + It is Jehovah who lights up my darkness. + 30 With your help I can charge against a marauder band; By God’s power I can scale a wall. + 31 The way of the true God is perfect; + The saying of Jehovah is refined. + He is a shield to all those taking refuge in him. + 32 For who is a God besides Jehovah? + And who is a rock except our God? + 33 The true God is my strong fortress, + And he will make my way perfect. + 34 He makes my feet like those of a deer; He makes me stand on high places. + 35 He trains my hands for warfare; My arms can bend a bow of copper. 36 You give me your shield of salvation, And your humility makes me great. + 37 You widen the path for my footsteps; My feet * will not slip. + 38 I will pursue my enemies and annihilate them; I will not return until they are wiped out. 39 And I will wipe them out and crush them, so that they will not rise up; + They will fall under my feet. 40 You will equip me with strength for the battle; + You will make my foes collapse under me. + 41 You will make my enemies retreat from me; * + I will put an end to * those who hate me. + 42 They cry for help, but there is no one to save them; They even cry to Jehovah, but he does not answer them. + 43 I will pound them as fine as the dust of the earth; I will pulverize and trample them like mud in the streets. 44 You will rescue me from the faultfinding of my people. + You will safeguard me to be the head of nations; + A people whom I have not known will serve me. + 45 Foreigners will come cringing before me; + What they hear about me will make them obey me. * 46 Foreigners will lose courage; * They will come trembling from their strongholds. 47 Jehovah is alive! Praised be my Rock! + Let the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted. + 48 The true God executes vengeance for me; + He subdues the peoples under me; + 49 He rescues me from my enemies. You lift me high + above those who attack me; You save me from the man of violence. + 50 That is why I will thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations, + And to your name I will sing praises: * + 51 He performs great acts of salvation * for his king; + He displays loyal love to his anointed one, To David and his offspring * forever.” + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “my powerful savior.” ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
