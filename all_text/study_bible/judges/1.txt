Judges 1:1-36 1 After the death of Joshua, + the Israelites * inquired of Jehovah: + “Who of us will go up first to fight against the Caʹnaan·ites?” 2 Jehovah replied: “Judah will go up. + Look! I am giving * the land into his hand.” 3 Then Judah said to his brother Simʹe·on: “Come up with me into my assigned territory * + to fight against the Caʹnaan·ites. Then I will go with you into your assigned territory.” So Simʹe·on went with him. 4 When Judah went up, Jehovah gave the Caʹnaan·ites and the Perʹiz·zites into their hands, + and they defeated 10,000 men in Beʹzek. 5 They found A·doʹni-beʹzek in Beʹzek, and there they fought against him and defeated the Caʹnaan·ites + and the Perʹiz·zites. + 6 When A·doʹni-beʹzek fled, they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 7 Then A·doʹni-beʹzek said: “There are 70 kings whose thumbs and big toes were cut off and who are picking up food under my table. Just as I have done, so God has repaid me.” After that they brought him to Jerusalem, + and he died there. 8 Furthermore, the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem + and captured it; they struck it with the sword and set the city on fire. 9 Afterward, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the mountainous region and the Negʹeb and the She·pheʹlah. + 10 So Judah marched against the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Hebʹron (the name of Hebʹron was previously Kirʹi·ath-arʹba), and they struck down Sheʹshai, A·hiʹman, and Talʹmai. + 11 They marched from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir. + (The name of Deʹbir was previously Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.) + 12 Then Caʹleb + said: “To the man who strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achʹsah as a wife.” + 13 And Othʹni·el + the son of Keʹnaz, + Caʹleb’s younger brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah as a wife. 14 While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey. * Caʹleb asked her: “What do you want?” 15 She said to him: “Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south; * give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim.” * So Caʹleb gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth. 16 And the descendants of the Kenʹite, + Moses’ father-in-law, + came up from the city of palm trees + with the people of Judah to the wilderness of Judah south of Aʹrad. + They went there and settled among the people. + 17 But Judah marched on with his brother Simʹe·on, and they attacked the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting Zeʹphath and devoted it to destruction. + So they named the city Horʹmah. * + 18 Then Judah captured Gazʹa + and its territory, Ashʹke·lon + and its territory, and Ekʹron + and its territory. 19 Jehovah was with Judah, and they took possession of the mountainous region, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, * because they had war chariots with iron scythes. * + 20 They gave Hebʹron to Caʹleb, just as Moses had promised, + and he drove out from there the three sons of Aʹnak. + 21 But the Benʹja·min·ites did not drive out the Jebʹu·sites inhabiting Jerusalem, so the Jebʹu·sites continue dwelling with the Benʹja·min·ites in Jerusalem down to this day. + 22 Meantime, the house of Joseph + went up against Bethʹel, and Jehovah was with them. + 23 The house of Joseph was spying on Bethʹel (incidentally, the name of the city was previously Luz), + 24 and the spies saw a man going out of the city. So they said to him: “Show us, please, the way into the city, and we will treat you kindly.” * 25 So the man showed them the way into the city, and they struck the city with the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. + 26 The man went to the land of the Hitʹtites and built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day. 27 Ma·nasʹseh did not take possession of Beth-sheʹan and its dependent * towns, Taʹa·nach + and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Ibʹle·am and its dependent towns, and the inhabitants of Me·gidʹdo and its dependent towns. + The Caʹnaan·ites persisted in dwelling in this land. 28 When Israel grew stronger, they subjected the Caʹnaan·ites to forced labor, + but they did not drive them out completely. + 29 Nor did Eʹphra·im drive out the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Geʹzer. The Caʹnaan·ites continued to dwell among them in Geʹzer. + 30 Zebʹu·lun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitʹron and the inhabitants of Naʹha·lol. + The Caʹnaan·ites continued to dwell among them and were subjected to forced labor. + 31 Ashʹer did not drive out the inhabitants of Acʹco and the inhabitants of Siʹdon, + Ahʹlab, Achʹzib, + Helʹbah, Aʹphik, + and Reʹhob. + 32 So the Ashʹer·ites continued to dwell among the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the land, because they did not drive them out. 33 Naphʹta·li did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh and the inhabitants of Beth-aʹnath, + but they continued to dwell among the Caʹnaan·ites inhabiting the land. + The inhabitants of Beth-sheʹmesh and Beth-aʹnath became forced laborers for them. 34 The Amʹor·ites confined the Danʹites to the mountainous region, for they would not let them come down into the plain. * + 35 So the Amʹor·ites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heʹres, Aiʹja·lon, + and Sha·alʹbim. + But when the power * of the house of Joseph increased, * they were forced into hard labor. 36 The territory of the Amʹor·ites was from the ascent of A·krabʹbim, + from Seʹla upward.
