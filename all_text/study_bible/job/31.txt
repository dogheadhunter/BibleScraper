Job 31:1-40 31 “I have made a covenant with my eyes. + So how could I show improper attention to a virgin? + 2 What, then, would be my share from God above, What inheritance from the Almighty on high? 3 Does not disaster await the wrongdoer And calamity those doing what is harmful? + 4 Does he not see my ways + And count all my steps? 5 Have I ever walked in untruth? * Has my foot hurried to deceive? + 6 Let God weigh me with accurate scales; + Then he will recognize my integrity. + 7 If my footsteps deviate from the way + Or my heart has followed after my eyes + Or my hands have been defiled, 8 Then let me sow seed and someone else eat, + And let what I plant be uprooted. * 9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman + And I have lain in wait + at my neighbor’s door, 10 Then let my wife grind grain for another man, And let other men have sexual relations with her. * + 11 For that would be shameful conduct, An error deserving punishment by the judges. + 12 It would be a fire that would devour and destroy, * + Consuming even the roots of * all my produce. 13 If I denied justice to my male or female servants When they had a complaint * against me, 14 What can I do when God confronts me? * What can I answer him when he calls for an accounting? + 15 Did not the One who made me in the womb also make them? + Was it not the same One who formed us before our birth? * + 16 If I refused to give the poor what they desired + Or saddened the eyes of the widow; * + 17 If I ate my portion of food alone Without sharing it with the orphans; + 18 (For from my youth the orphan * grew up with me as though I were his father, And I have been a guide for the widow * from childhood. * ) 19 If I saw anyone perishing for lack of clothing Or a poor man with nothing to cover himself; + 20 If he * did not bless me + As he warmed himself with the wool of my sheep; 21 If I shook my fist against the orphan + When he needed my assistance in the city gate; * + 22 Then let my arm * fall from my shoulder, And let my arm be broken at the elbow. * 23 For I dreaded disaster from God, And I could not stand before his dignity. 24 If I put my confidence in gold Or said to fine gold, ‘You are my security!’ + 25 If I found my joy in my great wealth + Because of the many possessions I acquired; + 26 If I saw the sun * shining Or the moon moving in its splendor; + 27 And my heart was secretly enticed, And my mouth kissed my hand in worship of them; + 28 Then that would be an error deserving punishment by the judges, For I would have denied the true God above. 29 Have I ever rejoiced over the destruction of my enemy + Or gloated because evil befell him? 30 I never allowed my mouth to sin By asking for his life * in an oath. + 31 Have the men of my tent not said, ‘Who can find anyone who has not been satisfied with his food?’ * + 32 No stranger * had to spend the night outside; + I opened my doors to the traveler. 33 Have I ever tried to cover over my transgressions, like other men, + By hiding my error in the pocket of my garment? 34 Have I been in fear of the reaction of the multitude, Or have I been terrified by the contempt of other families, Making me silent and afraid to go outside? 35 If only someone would listen to me! + I would sign my name to what I have said. * Let the Almighty answer me! + If only my accuser had written out the charges in a document! 36 I would carry it on my shoulder, And I would bind it around my head like a crown. 37 I would give him an accounting for every step I took; I would approach him confidently, like a prince. 38 If my own ground would cry out against me And its furrows would weep together; 39 If I have eaten its fruitage without payment, + Or if I have caused its owners * to despair; + 40 Then let thorns sprout for me instead of wheat And foul-smelling weeds instead of barley.” The words of Job end here.
