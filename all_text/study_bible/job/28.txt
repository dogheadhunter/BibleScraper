Job 28:1-28 28 “There is a place to mine silver And a place for gold that they refine; + 2 Iron is taken from the ground, And copper is smelted * from rocks. + 3 Man conquers the darkness; He probes to the limit in the gloom and darkness, Searching for ore. * 4 He sinks a shaft far from where people reside, In forgotten places, far from where people walk; Some men descend and swing suspended. 5 Food grows on top of the earth; But below, there is an upheaval as if by fire. * 6 There in the stones is sapphire, And the dust contains gold. 7 No bird of prey knows the path to it; The eye of a black kite has not seen it. 8 No majestic beasts have trodden on it; The young lion has not prowled there. 9 Man strikes the flinty rock with his hand; He overturns the mountains at their foundation. 10 He cuts water channels + in the rock; His eyes spot every precious thing. 11 He dams up the sources of rivers And brings what was hidden to the light. 12 But wisdom—where can it be found, + And where is the source of understanding? + 13 No man recognizes its value, + And it cannot be found in the land of the living. 14 The deep waters say, ‘It is not in me!’ And the sea says, ‘It is not with me!’ + 15 It cannot be bought with pure gold; Nor can silver be weighed out in exchange for it. + 16 It cannot be bought with gold of Oʹphir + Nor with rare onyx and sapphire. 17 Gold and glass cannot be compared to it; Nor can a vessel of fine * gold be exchanged for it. + 18 Coral and crystal are not worthy of mention, + For a bagful of wisdom is worth more than one full of pearls. 19 The topaz + of Cush cannot be compared to it; It cannot be purchased even with pure gold. 20 But from where does wisdom come, And where is the source of understanding? + 21 It has been hidden from the eyes of every living thing + And concealed from the birds of the heavens. 22 Destruction and death say, ‘Our ears have heard only a report of it.’ 23 God understands the way to find it; He alone knows where it resides, + 24 For he looks to the ends of the earth, And he sees everything under the heavens. + 25 When he set the force * of the wind + And measured out the waters, + 26 When he made a regulation for the rain + And a path for the thunderous storm cloud, + 27 Then he saw wisdom and explained it; He established and tested it. 28 And he said to man: ‘Look! The fear of Jehovah—that is wisdom, + And to turn away from bad is understanding.’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “poured.” ^ Lit., “stone.” ^ Apparently a reference to mining operations. ^ Or “refined.” ^ Lit., “weight.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
