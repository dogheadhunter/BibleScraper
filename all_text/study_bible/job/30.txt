Job 30:1-31 30 “Now they laugh at me + —Men younger than I am, Whose fathers I would have refused To put with the dogs that guarded my flock. 2 Of what use was the power of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished. 3 They are worn out from want and hunger; They gnaw at the parched ground That was already ruined and desolated. 4 They gather the salt herb from the bushes; Their food is the root of broom trees. 5 They are driven out of the community; + People shout at them as they would at a thief. 6 They live on the slopes of ravines, * In holes in the ground and in the rocks. 7 From the bushes they cry out And huddle together among the nettles. 8 As sons of the senseless and the nameless ones, They have been driven * out of the land. 9 But now they mock me even in their songs; + I have become an object of scorn * to them. + 10 They detest me and keep their distance from me; + They do not hesitate to spit in my face. + 11 Because God has disarmed me * and humbled me, They throw off all restraint * in my presence. 12 On my right they rise up like a mob; They put me to flight And put up barriers of destruction in my path. 13 They tear up my roadways And make my calamity worse, + Without anyone to stop them. * 14 They come as if through a wide breach in the wall; They roll in amid the devastation. 15 Terror overwhelms me; My dignity is driven away like the wind, And my salvation vanishes like a cloud. 16 Now my life * ebbs from me; + Days of affliction + take hold of me. 17 Aching pierces my bones * at night; + The gnawing pain never stops. + 18 With great force my garment is disfigured; * Like the collar of my garment, it chokes me. 19 God has thrown me down into the mud; I am reduced to dust and ashes. 20 I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me; + I stand up, but you just look at me. 21 You have cruelly turned against me; + With the full might of your hand, you assault me. 22 You pick me up and carry me off with the wind; Then you toss me about in the storm. * 23 For I know that you will bring me down to death, To the house where everyone living will meet. 24 But no one would strike at a broken man * + As he cries for help during his time of disaster. 25 Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times? * Have I * not grieved for the poor? + 26 Although I hoped for good, bad came; I expected the light, but darkness came. 27 The churning inside me did not stop; Days of affliction confronted me. 28 I walk about gloomy; + there is no sunlight. In the assembly, I rise and cry for help. 29 I have become a brother to jackals And a companion to the daughters of the ostrich. + 30 My skin has blackened and fallen off; + My bones burn from the heat. * 31 My harp is used only for mourning, And my flute * for the sound of weeping.
