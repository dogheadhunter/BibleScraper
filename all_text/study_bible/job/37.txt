Job 37:1-24 37 “At this my heart pounds And leaps from its place. 2 Listen carefully to the rumbling of his voice And the thunder that comes from his mouth. 3 He unleashes it under the entire heavens And sends his lightning + to the ends of the earth. 4 After that is a roaring sound; He thunders with a majestic voice, + And he does not hold it back when his voice is heard. 5 God thunders with his voice + in a wonderful way; He does great things that are beyond our understanding. + 6 For he says to the snow, ‘Fall to the earth,’ + And to the downpour of rain, ‘Pour down mightily.’ + 7 God puts a stop to all human activity * So that every mortal man will know His work. 8 The wild animals go into their dens And remain in their lairs. 9 The storm wind blows from its chamber, + And the cold comes from the north winds. + 10 By the breath of God, the ice is produced, + And the broad waters are frozen solid. + 11 Yes, he weighs down the clouds with moisture; He scatters his lightning + in the clouds; 12 They swirl around where he directs them; They carry out whatever he commands + on the surface of the inhabited earth. * 13 Whether it is for punishment * + or for the sake of the land Or for loyal love, he causes it to happen. + 14 Listen to this, Job; Stop and consider carefully the wonderful works of God. + 15 Do you know how God controls * the clouds And how he causes the lightning to flash from his cloud? 16 Do you know how the clouds float? + These are the wonderful works of the One perfect in knowledge. + 17 Why does your clothing become hot When the earth is still because of the south wind? + 18 Can you, with him, spread out * the skies + As solid as a metal mirror? 19 Tell us what we should say to him; We cannot answer because we are in the dark. 20 Should he be told that I want to speak? Or has anyone said something that should be communicated to him? + 21 They cannot even see the light, * Though it is bright in the sky, Until a wind passes by and clears away the clouds. 22 Out of the north comes golden splendor; God’s majesty + is awe-inspiring. 23 Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach; + He is great in power, + And he never violates his justice + and abundant righteousness. + 24 Therefore, people should fear him. + For he does not favor any who think that they are wise.” * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “puts a seal on the hand of every human.” ^ Or “of the productive land of the earth.” ^ Lit., “a rod.” ^ Or “commands.” ^ Or “beat out.” ^ That is, of the sun. ^ Lit., “who are wise of heart.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
