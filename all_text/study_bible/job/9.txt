Job 9:1-35 9 Job said in reply: 2 “For a fact I know that this is so. But how can mortal man be in the right in a case with God? + 3 If someone wishes to argue with Him, * + That one could not answer one of His questions in a thousand. 4 He is wise in heart and mighty in power. + Who can resist him and come off uninjured? + 5 He moves * mountains without anyone knowing it; He overturns them in his anger. 6 He shakes the earth out of its place, So that its pillars tremble. + 7 He commands the sun not to shine And seals off the light of the stars; + 8 He spreads out the heavens by himself, + And he treads upon the high waves of the sea. + 9 He made the Ash, * the Keʹsil, * and the Kiʹmah constellations, * + And the constellations of the southern sky; * 10 He does great and unsearchable things, + Wonderful things that cannot be counted. + 11 He passes by me, and I cannot see him; He moves past me, but I do not discern him. 12 When he snatches something, who can resist him? Who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ + 13 God will not restrain his anger; + Even the helpers of Raʹhab * + will bow down to him. 14 How much more when I answer him Must I choose my words carefully to argue with him! 15 Even if I were in the right, I would not answer him. + I could only plead for mercy from my judge. * 16 If I call out to him, will he answer me? I do not believe that he will listen to my voice, 17 For he crushes me with a storm And multiplies my wounds for no reason. + 18 He does not let me catch my breath; He keeps filling me with bitter things. 19 If it is a matter of power, he is the strong one. + If it is a matter of justice, he says: ‘Who can call me to account?’ * 20 If I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; Even if I keep my integrity, * he will declare me guilty. * 21 Even if I keep my integrity, * I am not confident about myself; * I reject * this life of mine. 22 It is all the same. That is why I say, ‘He destroys the innocent * and the wicked alike.’ 23 If a flash flood should cause sudden death, He would mock at the despair of the innocent. 24 The earth has been handed over to the wicked; + He covers the eyes * of its judges. If it is not he, then, who is it? 25 Now my days are swifter than a runner; + They run away without seeing good. 26 They glide by like reed boats, Like eagles that swoop down on their prey. 27 If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression and be cheerful,’ 28 I would still be afraid because of all my pains, + And I know you would not find me innocent. 29 I would be found guilty. * So why should I struggle in vain? + 30 If I wash myself in water from melting snow, And I cleanse my hands in lye, * + 31 Then you would dip me in a pit, So that even my own garments would detest me. 32 For he is not a man like me that I may answer him, That we should go to court together. + 33 There is no person to decide * between us, Who could serve as our judge. * 34 If he would stop beating me * And not let his terror frighten me, + 35 Then I would speak to him unafraid, For it is not in me to speak out of fear.
