Job 12:1-25 12 Then Job said in reply: 2 “Surely you are the people who know, * And wisdom will die out with you! 3 But I too have understanding. * I am not inferior to you. Who does not know these things? 4 I have become a laughingstock to my companions, + One calling to God for an answer. + A righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock. 5 The carefree person has contempt for calamity, Thinking it is only for those whose feet are unsteady. * 6 The tents of robbers are at peace, + And those who provoke God are secure, + Those who have their god in their hands. 7 However, ask, please, the animals, and they will instruct you; Also the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you. 8 Or give consideration * to the earth, and it will instruct you; And the fish of the sea will declare it to you. 9 Who among all these does not know That the hand of Jehovah has done this? 10 In his hand is the life of every living thing * And the spirit * of every human. * + 11 Does not the ear test out words As the tongue * tastes food? + 12 Is not wisdom found among the aged, + And does not understanding come with a long life? 13 With him there are wisdom and mightiness; + He has counsel and understanding. + 14 When he tears something down, it cannot be rebuilt; + What he has shut, no man can open. 15 When he withholds the waters, everything dries up; + When he sends them out, they overwhelm the earth. + 16 With him there are strength and practical wisdom; + To him belong the one going astray and the one leading astray; 17 He makes counselors go barefoot, * And he makes fools of judges. + 18 He loosens the bonds imposed by kings, + And he binds a belt around their waist. 19 He makes priests walk barefoot, + And he overthrows those who are firmly established in power; + 20 He deprives trusted advisers of speech And takes away the sensibleness of old men; * 21 He pours out contempt upon nobles, + And he makes powerful ones weak; * 22 He reveals deep things from the darkness, + And he brings deep darkness into the light; 23 He makes nations grow great in order to destroy them; He enlarges nations, that he may lead them into exile. 24 He takes away the understanding * of the leaders of the people And makes them wander in trackless wastelands. + 25 They grope in darkness, + where there is no light; He makes them wander about like drunken men. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “you are the people.” ^ Lit., “a heart.” ^ Or “slipping.” ^ Or possibly, “speak.” ^ Or “the soul of everyone alive.” ^ Or “breath.” ^ Lit., “of all flesh of man.” ^ Lit., “palate.” ^ Or “stripped of everything.” ^ Or “of elders.” ^ Lit., “loosens the belt of powerful ones.” ^ Lit., “heart.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
