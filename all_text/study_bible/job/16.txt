Job 16:1-22 16 Job said in reply: 2 “I have heard many things like these before. All of you are troublesome comforters! + 3 Is there an end to empty * words? What provokes you to answer this way? 4 I could also speak as you do. If you were in my place, * I could make persuasive speeches against you And shake my head at you. + 5 Instead, though, I would strengthen you with the words of my mouth, And the consolation of my lips would bring relief. + 6 If I speak, my own pain is not relieved, + And if I stop speaking, how much is my pain reduced? 7 But now he has made me weary; + He has devastated my whole household. * 8 You also seize me, and it has become a witness, So that my own skinniness rises up and testifies to my face. 9 His anger has torn me to pieces, and he harbors animosity against me. + He grinds his teeth against me. My adversary pierces me with his eyes. + 10 They have opened their mouth wide against me, + And they have scornfully struck my cheeks; In large numbers they gather against me. + 11 God hands me over to young boys, And he thrusts me into the hands of the wicked. + 12 I was untroubled, but he shattered me; + He grabbed me by the back of the neck and crushed me; Then he set me up as his target. 13 His archers surround me; + He pierces my kidneys + and feels no compassion; He pours out my gall on the earth. 14 He breaks through against me with breach after breach; He rushes at me like a warrior. 15 I have sewn sackcloth together to cover my skin, + And I have buried my dignity * in the dust. + 16 My face is red from weeping, + And on my eyelids is deep shadow, * 17 Although my hands have done no violence And my prayer is pure. 18 O earth, do not cover my blood! + And let there be no resting-place for my outcry! 19 Even now, my witness is in the heavens; The one who can testify for me is in the heights. 20 My companions ridicule me + As my eye sheds tears * to God. + 21 Let someone arbitrate between a man and God, As one would between a man and his fellow. + 22 For the years to come are few, And I will go away on the path of no return. + Footnotes ^ Or “blustery.” ^ Or “If your soul were in place of my soul.” ^ Or “those assembling with me.” ^ Or “strength.” Lit., “horn.” ^ Or “death’s shadow.” ^ Or possibly, “looks sleeplessly.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
