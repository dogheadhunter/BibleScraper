Job 35:1-16 35 E·liʹhu continued his response: 2 “Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say, ‘I am more righteous than God’? + 3 For you say, ‘What does it matter to you? * Am I better off than if I had sinned?’ + 4 I will reply to you And to your companions + with you. 5 Look up to heaven and see, Observe the clouds, + which are high above you. 6 If you sin, how do you hurt him? + If your transgressions multiply, what do you do to him? + 7 If you are righteous, what do you give him; What does he receive from you? + 8 Your wickedness affects only a human like yourself, And your righteousness, a son of man. 9 People cry out when under great oppression; They cry for relief from the domination * of the powerful. + 10 But no one says, ‘Where is God, my Grand Maker, + The one causing songs to be sung in the night?’ + 11 He teaches us + more than the beasts of the earth, + And he makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens. 12 People cry out, but he does not answer, + Because of the pride of the wicked. + 13 Surely God does not hear an empty cry; * + The Almighty does not pay attention to it. 14 How much less, then, when you complain that you do not see him! + Your legal case is before him, so you should wait anxiously for him. + 15 For he has not angrily called for an accounting; Nor has he taken note of your extreme rashness. + 16 Job opens his mouth wide in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge.” + Footnotes ^ Likely referring to God. ^ Lit., “arm.” ^ Or “a lie.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
