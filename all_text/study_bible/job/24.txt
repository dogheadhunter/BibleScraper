Job 24:1-25 24 “Why does the Almighty not set a time? + Why do those who know him not see his day? * 2 People move boundary markers; + They carry off flocks for their own pasture. 3 They drive away the donkey of fatherless children And seize the widow’s bull as security for a loan. * + 4 They force the poor off the road; The helpless of the earth must hide from them. + 5 The poor forage for food like wild donkeys + in the wilderness; They seek food in the desert for their children. 6 They must harvest in another’s field * And glean from the vineyard of the wicked. 7 They spend the night naked, without clothing; + They have no covering for the cold. 8 They are drenched by the mountain rains; They cling to the rocks for lack of shelter. 9 The fatherless child is snatched away from the breast; + And the garments of the poor are taken as security for a loan, + 10 Forcing them to go about naked, without clothing, And hungry, as they carry the sheaves of grain. 11 They toil among the terrace walls in the heat of the day; * They tread the winepresses, yet they go thirsty. + 12 The dying keep groaning in the city; The fatally wounded * cry for help, + But God does not regard this as improper. * 13 There are those who rebel against light; + They do not recognize its ways, And they do not follow its paths. 14 The murderer rises at daybreak; He slays the helpless and the poor, + While at night he engages in theft. 15 The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, + Saying, ‘No one will see me!’ + And he covers his face. 16 In the darkness they break into * houses; By day they shut themselves in. They are strangers to the light. + 17 For morning is the same as deep darkness for them; They are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness. 18 But they are swiftly carried away by the waters. * Their portion of the land will be cursed. + They will not return to their vineyards. 19 Just as drought and heat take away the melted snow, The Grave * takes away those who have sinned! + 20 His mother * will forget him; the maggot will feast on him. He will be remembered no more. + And unrighteousness will be broken just like a tree. 21 He preys on the barren woman, And mistreats the widow. 22 God * will use his strength to do away with the powerful; Though they may rise up, they have no assurance of life. 23 God * lets them become confident and secure, + But his eyes are on everything they do. * + 24 They are exalted for a little while, then they are no more. + They are brought low + and gathered like everyone else; They are cut off like heads of grain. 25 Now who can prove me a liar Or refute my word?” Footnotes ^ That is, his day of judgment. ^ Or “as a pledge.” ^ Or possibly, “harvest fodder in the field.” ^ Or possibly, “They press out oil among the terrace walls.” ^ Or “souls of the wounded.” ^ Or possibly, “God charges no one with wrong.” ^ Lit., “dig into.” ^ Lit., “He is swift on the surface of the waters.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
