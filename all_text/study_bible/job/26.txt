Job 26:1-14 26 Job said in reply: 2 “How you have helped the one with no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! + 3 What great advice you have given to the one lacking wisdom! + How freely * you have revealed your practical wisdom! * 4 To whom are you trying to speak, And who inspired you to say such things? * 5 Those who are powerless in death tremble; They are even lower than the waters and their inhabitants. 6 The Grave * is naked in front of God, * + And the place of destruction * lies uncovered. 7 He stretches out the northern sky * over empty space, * + Suspending the earth upon nothing; 8 He wraps up the waters in his clouds, + So that the clouds do not burst under their weight; 9 He shuts off the view of his throne, Spreading out his cloud over it. + 10 He marks out the horizon * on the surface of the waters; + He makes a boundary between light and darkness. 11 The very pillars of heaven shake; They are stunned by his rebuke. 12 He stirs up the sea with his power, + And by his understanding he breaks the sea monster * to pieces. + 13 With his breath * he makes the skies clear; His hand pierces the elusive * serpent. 14 Look! These are just the fringes of his ways; + Only a faint whisper has been heard of him! So who can understand his mighty thunder?” + Footnotes ^ Or “abundantly.” ^ Or “common sense.” ^ Lit., “And whose breath (spirit) has come out from you?” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
