Job 17:1-16 17 “My spirit has been broken, my days have been extinguished; The graveyard awaits me. + 2 Mockers surround me, + And my eye must gaze at * their rebellious behavior. 3 Please accept my security, and keep it with you. Who else will shake hands with me and pledge in my behalf? + 4 For you have concealed discernment from their heart; + That is why you do not exalt them. 5 He may offer to share with his friends, While the eyes of his children fail. 6 He has made me an object of scorn * among the peoples, + So that I became one in whose face they spit. + 7 From anguish my eyes grow dim, + And all my limbs are but a shadow. 8 Upright people stare in amazement at this, And the innocent one is disturbed over the godless. * 9 The righteous one keeps holding fast to his way, + And the one with clean hands grows stronger. + 10 However, you may all come and resume your arguing, For I have not found anyone wise among you. + 11 My days are finished; + My plans, the desires of my heart, have been shattered. + 12 They keep turning night into day, Saying, ‘Light must be near because it is dark.’ 13 If I wait, the Grave * will become my home; + I will spread out my bed in darkness. + 14 I will call out to the pit, * + ‘You are my father!’ To the maggot, ‘My mother and my sister!’ 15 Where, then, is my hope? + Who can see hope for me? 16 It * will go down to the barred gates of the Grave * When we all descend together into the dust.” + Footnotes ^ Or “dwell on.” ^ Lit., “a proverb; a byword.” ^ Or “the apostate.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
