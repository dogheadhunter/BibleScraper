Job 7:1-21 7 “Is not the life of mortal man on earth like compulsory labor, And are not his days like those of a hired worker? + 2 Like a slave, he longs for the shadow, And like a hired worker, he waits for his wages. + 3 Thus I have been assigned months of futility And nights of misery have been counted out for me. + 4 When I lie down I ask, ‘When will I get up?’ + But as the night drags on, I toss restlessly until the dawning of the day. * 5 My flesh is covered with maggots and clods of dirt; + My skin is full of scabs and pus. + 6 My days go by more quickly than a weaver’s shuttle, + And they come to an end without hope. + 7 Remember that my life is wind, + That my eye will never again see happiness. * 8 The eye that sees me now will see me no more; Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone. + 9 Like a cloud that fades and vanishes, The one who goes down to the Grave * does not come back up. + 10 He will not return again to his house, And his place will acknowledge him no more. + 11 Therefore, I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in my bitter distress! * + 12 Am I the sea or a sea monster, That you should set a guard over me? 13 When I say, ‘My couch will comfort me; My bed will help ease my misery,’ 14 Then you terrify me with dreams And frighten me with visions, 15 So that I * would choose suffocation, Yes, death rather than this body of mine. * + 16 I loathe my life; + I do not want to go on living. Leave me alone, for my days are like a breath. + 17 What is mortal man that you should concern yourself with him And fix your attention * on him? + 18 Why do you inspect him every morning And test him every moment? + 19 Will you not look away from me And leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva? + 20 If I have sinned, how could I harm you, the Observer of mankind? + Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? 21 Why do you not pardon my transgression And excuse my error? For soon I will lie down in the dust, + And you will look for me, but I will be gone.” Footnotes ^ Or “until morning twilight.” ^ Lit., “see good.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
