Job 25:1-6 25 Bilʹdad + the Shuʹhite said in reply: 2 “Rulership and fearsome might are his; He establishes peace in heaven. * 3 Can his troops be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise? 4 So how can mortal man be righteous before God, + Or how can one born of a woman be innocent? * + 5 Even the moon is not bright And the stars are not pure in his eyes, 6 How much less so mortal man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, who is a worm!” Footnotes ^ Lit., “in his heights.” ^ Or “pure.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
