To the Hebrews 8:1-13 8 Now this is the main point of what we are saying: We have such a high priest as this, + and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, + 2 a minister * of the holy place + and of the true tent, which Jehovah * set up, and not man. 3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. + 4 If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, + since there are already men who offer the gifts according to the Law. 5 These men are offering sacred service in a typical representation and a shadow + of the heavenly things; + just as Moses, when about to construct the tent, was given the divine command: For He says: “See that you make all things after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.” + 6 But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry * because he is also the mediator + of a correspondingly better covenant, + which has been legally established on better promises. + 7 If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second. + 8 For he does find fault with the people when he says: “‘Look! The days are coming,’ says Jehovah, * ‘when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant. 9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, + because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah. * 10 “‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. * ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. + And I will become their God, and they will become my people. + 11 “‘And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” * For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them. 12 For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.’” + 13 In his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete. + Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away. + Footnotes ^ Or “public servant.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “public service.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 .
