Joshua 16:1-10 16 And the land that fell by lot * + to the descendants of Joseph + was from the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho to the waters east of Jerʹi·cho, through the wilderness going up from Jerʹi·cho into the mountainous region of Bethʹel. + 2 It extended from Bethʹel belonging to Luz and continued to the boundary of the Arʹchites at Atʹa·roth, 3 then it went down westward to the boundary of the Japhʹle·tites as far as the boundary of Lower Beth-hoʹron + and Geʹzer, + and it ended at the sea. 4 So Joseph’s descendants, + Ma·nasʹseh and Eʹphra·im, took possession of their land. + 5 The boundary of the descendants of Eʹphra·im by their families was as follows: The boundary of their inheritance to the east was Atʹa·roth-adʹdar, + as far as Upper Beth-hoʹron, + 6 and the boundary extended to the sea. Mich·meʹthath + was on the north, and the boundary went around east to Taʹa·nath-shiʹloh, and it passed on the east to Ja·noʹah. 7 Then it went down from Ja·noʹah to Atʹa·roth and Naʹa·rah and reached to Jerʹi·cho + and extended to the Jordan. 8 From Tapʹpu·ah + the boundary continued westward to the Wadi of Kaʹnah, and it ended at the sea. + This is the inheritance of the tribe of Eʹphra·im by their families; 9 the descendants of Eʹphra·im also had enclave cities in the midst of the inheritance of Ma·nasʹseh, + all the cities and their settlements. 10 But they did not drive away the Caʹnaan·ites who were dwelling in Geʹzer, + and the Caʹnaan·ites continue to dwell among Eʹphra·im to this day + and have been subjected to forced labor. + Footnotes ^ Or “was allotted.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
