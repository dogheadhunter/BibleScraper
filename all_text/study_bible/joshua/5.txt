Joshua 5:1-15 5 As soon as all the kings of the Amʹor·ites + who were on the west side * of the Jordan and all the kings of the Caʹnaan·ites + who were by the sea heard that Jehovah had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, they lost heart, * + and they lost all courage * because of the Israelites. + 2 At that time Jehovah said to Joshua: “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise + the men of Israel again, a second time.” 3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the men of Israel at Gibʹe·ath-ha·arʹa·loth. * + 4 This is why Joshua circumcised them: All the males of the people who left Egypt, all the men of war, * had died in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt. + 5 All the people who left Egypt were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the journey after they left Egypt were not circumcised. 6 The Israelites had walked for 40 years + in the wilderness until the entire nation had died off, that is, the men of war who left Egypt who did not obey the voice of Jehovah. + Jehovah swore to them that he would never let them see the land + that Jehovah had sworn to their forefathers to give to us, + a land flowing with milk and honey. + 7 So he raised up their sons instead of them. + These Joshua circumcised; they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them during the journey. 8 When they finished circumcising the entire nation, they remained where they were in the camp until they recovered. 9 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: “Today I have rolled away from you the reproach of Egypt.” So that place has been called Gilʹgal * + until this day. 10 The Israelites continued to camp at Gilʹgal, and they observed the Passover on the 14th day of the month, + in the evening, on the desert plains of Jerʹi·cho. 11 And they began to eat the produce of the land the day after the Passover, unleavened bread + and roasted grains, on this same day. 12 And the manna stopped on the following day when they had eaten some of the produce of the land; there was no longer manna for the Israelites, + but they began to eat the produce of the land of Caʹnaan in that year. + 13 When Joshua was near Jerʹi·cho, he looked up and saw a man + standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. + Joshua walked up to him and asked: “Are you on our side or on the side of our adversaries?” 14 To this he said: “No, but I have come as prince * of Jehovah’s army.” + With that Joshua fell with his face to the ground and prostrated himself and said to him: “What does my lord have to say to his servant?” 15 The prince of Jehovah’s army replied to Joshua: “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy.” At once Joshua did so. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the side toward the sea.” ^ Lit., “their hearts melted.” ^ Lit., “and there was no spirit in them any longer.” ^ Meaning “Hill of the Foreskins.” ^ Or “the men of military age.” ^ Meaning “Rolling; Rolling Away.” ^ Or “chief.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
