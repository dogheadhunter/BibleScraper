Joshua 20:1-9 20 Then Jehovah said to Joshua: 2 “Tell the Israelites, ‘Select for yourselves the cities of refuge + about which I spoke to you through Moses, 3 so that the manslayer who unintentionally or accidentally * kills someone * may flee there. And they will serve as a refuge for you from the avenger of blood. + 4 He must flee to one of these cities + and stand at the entrance of the city gate + and present his case in the hearing of the elders of that city. Then they must receive him into the city and give him a place and he will live with them. 5 If the avenger of blood chases after him, they should not surrender the manslayer into his hand, for he killed his fellow man accidentally * and he did not previously hate him. + 6 He must dwell in that city until he stands trial before the assembly + and remain there until the death of the high priest + who is in office at that time. Then the manslayer may return to the city from which he fled, and he may enter his city and his house.’” + 7 So they gave a sacred status to * Keʹdesh + in Galʹi·lee in the mountainous region of Naphʹta·li, Sheʹchem + in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, + that is, Hebʹron, in the mountainous region of Judah. 8 In the region of the Jordan, east of Jerʹi·cho, they selected Beʹzer + in the wilderness on the tableland * out of the tribe of Reuʹben, Raʹmoth + in Gilʹe·ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Goʹlan + in Baʹshan out of the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh. + 9 These became the cities appointed for all the Israelites and for the foreign residents residing among them, so that anyone who unintentionally killed someone * could flee there + and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly. + Footnotes ^ Or “unknowingly.” ^ Or “strikes a soul.” ^ Or “unknowingly.” ^ Or “they set apart.” ^ Or “plateau.” ^ Or “a soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
