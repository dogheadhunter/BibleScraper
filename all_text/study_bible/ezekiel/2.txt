Ezekiel 2:1-10 2 He then said to me: “Son of man, * stand up on your feet that I may speak with you.” + 2 When he spoke to me, spirit came into me and made me stand up on my feet + so that I could hear the One speaking to me. 3 He went on to say to me: “Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel, + to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me. + They and their forefathers have transgressed against me down to this very day. + 4 I am sending you to sons who are defiant * and hardhearted, + and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says.’ 5 As for them, whether they listen or refuse to listen—for they are a rebellious house + —they will certainly know that a prophet was among them. + 6 “But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them, + and do not be afraid of their words, although you are surrounded by briars and thorns * + and are dwelling among scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words, + and do not be terrified by their faces, + for they are a rebellious house. 7 You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or not, for they are a rebellious people. + 8 “But you, son of man, listen to what I am telling you. Do not become rebellious like this rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” + 9 When I looked, I saw a hand stretched out to me, + and in it I saw a written scroll. * + 10 When he spread it out before me, it had writing on both front and back. + Dirges * and mourning and wailing were written on it. + Footnotes ^ “Son of man”; the first of 93 occurrences of this expression in Ezekiel. ^ Or “hard of face.” ^ Or possibly, “although the people are obstinate and are like things pricking you.” ^ Or “a scroll of a book.” ^ Or “Songs of mourning.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
