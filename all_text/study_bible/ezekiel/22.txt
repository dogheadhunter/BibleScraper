Ezekiel 22:1-31 22 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 “As for you, son of man, are you prepared to pronounce judgment on * the bloodguilty city + and to make known to her all her detestable things? + 3 You are to say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “O city that sheds blood + within herself, whose time is coming, + who makes disgusting idols * to defile herself, + 4 your bloodshed has made you guilty, + and your disgusting idols have made you unclean. + You have hastened the end of your days, and the end of your years has come. That is why I will make you an object of reproach to the nations and an object of mockery to all the lands. + 5 The lands nearby and those far away from you will mock you, + you whose name is unclean and who are filled with turmoil. 6 Look! Each of the chieftains of Israel among you uses his authority to shed blood. + 7 Within you they treat their father and mother with contempt. + They defraud the foreign resident, and they mistreat the fatherless child * and the widow.”’” + 8 “‘My holy places you despise, and my sabbaths you profane. + 9 Within you are slanderers intent on shedding blood. + Within you they eat sacrifices on the mountains and carry on obscene conduct in your midst. + 10 Within you they dishonor their father’s bed, * + and they violate a woman unclean in her menstruation. + 11 Within you one man acts detestably with his neighbor’s wife, + another defiles his own daughter-in-law with obscene conduct, + and another violates his sister, the daughter of his own father. + 12 Within you they take a bribe to shed blood. + You lend on interest + or for a profit, * and you extort money from your neighbors. + Yes, you have entirely forgotten me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 13 “‘Look! I clap my hands in disgust at the dishonest gain you have made and over the acts of bloodshed in your midst. 14 Will your courage * endure and your hands remain strong in the days when I take action against you? + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken, and I will take action. 15 I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands, + and I will put an end to your uncleanness. + 16 And you will be dishonored before the nations, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” + 17 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 18 “Son of man, the house of Israel has become like worthless dross to me. All of them are copper and tin and iron and lead in a furnace. They have become the dross of silver. + 19 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Because all of you have become like worthless dross, + I am collecting you together inside Jerusalem. 20 Just as silver and copper and iron and lead and tin are collected inside a furnace in order to blow fire upon them and melt them, so I will collect you together in my anger and in my rage, and I will blow upon you and make you melt. + 21 I will bring you together and blow upon you with the fire of my fury, + and you will be melted inside of her. + 22 Just as silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her; and you will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have poured out my rage on you.’” 23 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 24 “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that will not be cleansed or rained on in the day of indignation. 25 Her prophets have conspired within her, + like a roaring lion tearing prey. + They are devouring people. * They are seizing treasure and precious things. They have made many widows within her. 26 Her priests have violated my law, + and they keep profaning my holy places. + They make no distinction between what is holy and what is common, + and they fail to make known what is unclean and what is clean, + and they refuse to observe my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing prey; they shed blood and kill people * to make dishonest gain. + 28 But her prophets have plastered over their deeds with whitewash. They see false visions and give lying divination, + and they say: “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says,” when Jehovah himself has not spoken. 29 The people of the land have defrauded and committed robbery, + they have mistreated the needy and the poor, and they have defrauded the foreign resident and denied him justice.’ 30 “‘I was looking for a man from among them who would repair the stone wall or stand before me in the breach in behalf of the land, so that it would not be destroyed, + but I found no one. 31 So I will pour out my indignation on them and exterminate them with the fire of my fury. I will bring the consequences of their way on their own head,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “will you judge, will you judge.” ^ The Hebrew term may be related to a word for “dung” and is used as an expression of contempt. ^ Or “the orphan.” ^ Lit., “expose the nakedness of their father.” ^ Or “or take usury.” ^ Lit., “heart.” ^ Or “souls.” ^ Or “souls.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
