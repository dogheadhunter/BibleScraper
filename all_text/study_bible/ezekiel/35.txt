Ezekiel 35:1-15 35 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 “Son of man, turn your face toward the mountainous region of Seʹir, + and prophesy against it. + 3 Say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O mountainous region of Seʹir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate wasteland. + 4 I will turn your cities into ruins, and you will become a desolate wasteland; + and you will have to know that I am Jehovah. 5 For you showed unrelenting hostility, + and you gave the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their disaster, at the time of their final punishment.”’ + 6 “‘Therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. + Since it was blood that you hated, bloodshed will pursue you. + 7 I will make the mountainous region of Seʹir a desolate wasteland, + and I will cut off from it anyone passing through and anyone returning. 8 I will fill its mountains with the slain; and those slain by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your streams. 9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited; + and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ 10 “Because you said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will take possession of both,’ + even though Jehovah himself was there, 11 ‘therefore as surely as I am alive,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘I will deal with you according to the same anger and jealousy that you displayed in your hatred toward them; + and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. 12 You will then have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have heard all the insolent things you spoke against the mountains of Israel when you said, “They have been laid desolate and have been given to us to devour.” * 13 And you spoke arrogantly against me, and you multiplied your words against me. + I heard it all.’ 14 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘The whole earth will rejoice when I will make you a desolate wasteland. 15 Just as you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel was laid desolate, that is how I will deal with you. + You will become a desolate ruin, O mountainous region of Seʹir, yes, all of Eʹdom; + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “as food.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
