Ezekiel 30:1-26 30 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 2 “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Wail, ‘Alas, the day is coming!’ 3 For the day is near, yes, a day of Jehovah is near. + It will be a day of clouds, + an appointed time of nations. + 4 A sword will come against Egypt, and panic will overtake E·thi·oʹpi·a when the slain fall in Egypt; Its wealth is taken and its foundations are torn down. + 5 E·thi·oʹpi·a, + Put, + Lud, and all the mixed populations, * And Chub, along with the sons of the land of the covenant, * By the sword they will all fall.”’ 6 This is what Jehovah says: ‘The supporters of Egypt will also fall, And its arrogant power will be brought down.’ + “‘From Migʹdol + to Sy·eʹne + they will fall by the sword in the land,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 7 ‘They will be made the most desolate of lands, and its own cities will become the most devastated cities. + 8 And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I set a fire in Egypt and all its allies are crushed. 9 In that day I will send messengers in ships to make self-confident E·thi·oʹpi·a tremble; panic will seize them in the day that is coming upon Egypt, for it will surely come.’ 10 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will bring an end to Egypt’s hordes by the hand of King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar * of Babylon. + 11 He and his troops, the most ruthless of the nations, + will be brought in to destroy the land. They will draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. + 12 I will turn the canals of the Nile + into dry ground and will sell the land into the hand of wicked men. I will make the land and everything in it desolate by the hand of foreigners. + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.’ 13 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘I will also destroy the disgusting idols * and bring an end to the worthless gods of Noph. * + There will no longer be a prince * from the land of Egypt, and I will put fear in the land of Egypt. + 14 I will desolate Pathʹros + and set a fire in Zoʹan and execute judgment on No. * + 15 I will pour out my rage on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and destroy the population of No. 16 I will set a fire in Egypt; and Sin will be seized with terror and No will be broken through and Noph * will face attack in broad daylight! 17 The young men of On * and Pi·beʹseth will fall by the sword, and the cities will go into captivity. 18 In Te·haphʹne·hes the day will grow dark when I break the yoke bars of Egypt there. + Her arrogant power will come to an end, + clouds will cover her, and her towns will go into captivity. + 19 I will execute judgment on Egypt, and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” 20 And in the 11th year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharʹaoh king of Egypt; it will not be bound up to be healed or wrapped with a bandage to make it strong enough to take up the sword.” 22 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: ‘Here I am against Pharʹaoh king of Egypt, + and I will break his arms, the strong one and the broken one, + and I will make the sword fall from his hand. + 23 Then I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands. + 24 I will strengthen the arms * of the king of Babylon + and put my sword into his hand, + and I will break the arms of Pharʹaoh, and he will groan loudly like a dying man before him. * 25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharʹaoh will fall limp; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he wields it against the land of Egypt. + 26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands, + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” Footnotes ^ Or “all those from other nations.” ^ Perhaps a reference to Israelites who were allied with Egypt. ^ Lit., “Nebuchadrezzar,” a variant spelling. ^ Or “chieftain.” ^ Or “Memphis.” ^ The Hebrew term may be related to a word for “dung” and is used as an expression of contempt. ^ That is, Thebes. ^ Or “Memphis.” ^ That is, Heliopolis. ^ Or “increase the power.” ^ That is, before the king of Babylon.
