Isaiah 62:1-12 62 For the sake of Zion I will not keep silent, + And for the sake of Jerusalem I will not keep still Until her righteousness shines like a bright light + And her salvation burns like a torch. + 2 “The nations will see your righteousness, O woman, + And all kings your glory. + And you will be called by a new name, + Which Jehovah’s own mouth will designate. 3 You will become a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah, A royal turban in the palm of your God. 4 No more will you be called an abandoned woman, + And your land will no longer be called desolate. + But you will be called My Delight Is in Her, + And your land will be called the Married One. For Jehovah will take delight in you, And your land will be as one married. 5 For just as a young man marries a virgin, Your sons will marry you. With the rejoicing of a bridegroom over a bride, Your God will rejoice over you. + 6 Upon your walls, O Jerusalem, I have commissioned watchmen. Continuously, all day long and all night long, they should not be silent. You who make mention of Jehovah, Do not rest, 7 And do not give him any rest until he firmly establishes Jerusalem, Yes, until he makes her the praise of the earth.” + 8 Jehovah has sworn an oath with his right hand, with his strong arm: “I will no longer give your grain as food to your enemies, Nor will foreigners drink your new wine, for which you have toiled. + 9 But those gathering it will eat it and they will praise Jehovah; And those collecting it will drink it in my holy courtyards.” + 10 Pass through, pass through the gates. Clear the way for the people. + Build up, build up the highway. Rid it of stones. + Raise up a signal * for the peoples. + 11 Look! Jehovah has proclaimed to the ends of the earth: “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! Your salvation is coming. + Look! His reward is with him, And the wage he pays is before him.’” + 12 They will be called the holy people, those repurchased by Jehovah, + And you will be called Sought After, a City Not Abandoned. + Footnotes ^ Or “signal pole.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
