Isaiah 4:1-6 4 And seven women will grab hold of one man in that day, + saying: “We will eat our own bread And wear our own clothing; Only let us be called by your name To take away our disgrace.” * + 2 In that day what Jehovah makes sprout will be splendid and glorious, and the fruitage of the land will be the pride and beauty of the survivors of Israel. + 3 Whoever remains in Zion and is left over in Jerusalem will be called holy, all of those in Jerusalem written down for life. + 4 When Jehovah washes away the filth * of the daughters of Zion + and rinses away the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst by the spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning, * + 5 Jehovah will also create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over the place of her conventions a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flaming fire by night; + for over all the glory there will be a shelter. 6 And there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat, + and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain. + Footnotes ^ That is, the humiliation of being unmarried and childless. ^ Lit., “excrement.” ^ Or “purging.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
