Isaiah 58:1-14 58 “Call out full-throated; do not hold back! Raise your voice like a horn. Proclaim to my people their revolt, + To the house of Jacob their sins. 2 They seek me day after day, And they express delight to know my ways, As if they were a nation that had practiced righteousness And had not abandoned the justice of their God. + They ask me for righteous judgments, Delighting to draw close to God: + 3 ‘Why do you not see when we fast? + And why do you not notice when we afflict ourselves?’ * + Because on the day of your fast, you pursue your own interests, * And you oppress your laborers. + 4 Your fasting ends in quarrels and fights, And you strike with the fist of wickedness. You cannot fast as you do today and have your voice heard in heaven. 5 Should the fast that I choose be like this, As a day for someone to afflict himself, * To bow down his head like a rush, To make his bed on sackcloth and ashes? Is this what you call a fast and a day pleasing to Jehovah? 6 No, this is the fast that I choose: To remove the fetters of wickedness, To untie the bands of the yoke bar, + To let the oppressed go free, + And to break in half every yoke bar; 7 It is to share your bread with the hungry, + To bring the poor and homeless into your house, To clothe someone naked when you see him, + And not to turn your back on your own flesh. 8 Then your light will shine through like the dawn, + And your healing will spring up quickly. Your righteousness will go before you, And the glory of Jehovah will be your rear guard. + 9 Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer; You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am!’ If you remove from among you the yoke bar And stop pointing your finger and speaking maliciously, + 10 If you grant to the hungry what you yourself desire * + And satisfy those who are afflicted, * Then your light will shine even in the darkness, And your gloom will be like midday. + 11 Jehovah will always lead you And satisfy you * even in a parched land; + He will invigorate your bones, And you will become like a well-watered garden, + Like a spring whose waters never fail. 12 They will rebuild ancient ruins on your account, + And you will restore the foundations of past generations. + You will be called the repairer of the broken walls, * + The restorer of roadways by which to dwell. 13 If because of the Sabbath you refrain * from pursuing your own interests * on my holy day + And you call the Sabbath an exquisite delight, a holy day of Jehovah, a day to be glorified, + And you glorify it rather than pursuing your own interests and speaking idle words, 14 Then you will find your exquisite delight in Jehovah, And I will make you ride on the high places of the earth. + I will cause you to eat from * the inheritance of Jacob your forefather, + For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.” Footnotes ^ Or “our soul?” ^ Or “delight.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Or “the afflicted souls.” ^ Or “your own soul desires.” ^ Or “your soul.” ^ Lit., “the breach.” ^ Lit., “turn your foot back.” ^ Or “your own delights.” ^ Or “to enjoy.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
