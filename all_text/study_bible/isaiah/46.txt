Isaiah 46:1-13 46 Bel bends down, + Neʹbo stoops over. Their idols are loaded on animals, on beasts of burden, + Like baggage that burdens the weary animals. 2 They stoop and bend down together; They cannot rescue the loads, * And they themselves * go into captivity. 3 “Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all you who remain of the house of Israel, + You whom I have supported from birth and carried from the womb. + 4 Until you grow old I will be the same; + Until your hair is gray I will keep bearing you. As I have done, I will carry you and bear you and rescue you. + 5 To whom will you liken me or make me equal or compare me, + So that we should resemble each other? + 6 There are those who lavish gold from their purse; They weigh out the silver on the scale. They hire a metalworker, and he makes it into a god. + Then they prostrate themselves, yes, they worship it. * + 7 They lift it to their shoulders; + They carry it and put it in its place, and it just stands there. It does not move from its place. + They cry out to it, but it does not answer; It cannot rescue anyone from distress. + 8 Remember this, and take courage. Take it to heart, you transgressors. 9 Remember the former * things of long ago, That I am God, * and there is no other. I am God, and there is no one like me. + 10 From the beginning I foretell the outcome, And from long ago the things that have not yet been done. + I say, ‘My decision * will stand, + And I will do whatever I please.’ + 11 I am calling a bird of prey from the sunrise, * + From a distant land the man to carry out my decision. * + I have spoken, and I will bring it about. I have purposed it, and I will also carry it out. + 12 Listen to me, you who are stubborn * of heart, You who are far away from righteousness. 13 I have brought my righteousness near; It is not far away, And my salvation will not delay. + I will grant salvation in Zion, my splendor to Israel.” + Footnotes ^ That is, the idols loaded on the animals. ^ Or “their souls.” ^ Lit., “bow down to it.” ^ Lit., “first.” ^ Or “the Divine One.” ^ Or “purpose; counsel.” ^ Or “east.” ^ Or “purpose; counsel.” ^ Lit., “powerful.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
