Isaiah 16:1-14 16 Send a ram to the ruler of the land, From Seʹla through the wilderness To the mountain of the daughter of Zion. 2 Like a bird chased away from its nest, + So the daughters of Moʹab will be at the fords of Arʹnon. + 3 “Offer counsel, carry out the decision. Make your shadow at high noon like the night. Conceal the dispersed and do not betray those fleeing. 4 May my dispersed ones reside in you, O Moʹab. Become a place of concealment to them because of the destroyer. + The oppressor will reach his end, The destruction will come to an end, And those trampling others down will perish from the earth. 5 Then a throne will be firmly established in loyal love. The one who sits on it in the tent of David will be faithful; + He will judge fairly and will swiftly execute righteousness.” + 6 We have heard about the pride of Moʹab—he is very proud + — His haughtiness and his pride and his fury; + But his empty talk will come to nothing. 7 So Moʹab will wail for Moʹab; They will all wail. + Those who are stricken will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-harʹe·seth. + 8 For the terraces of Heshʹbon + have withered, The vine of Sibʹmah, + The rulers of the nations have trampled its bright-red branches; * They had reached as far as Jaʹzer; + They had extended into the wilderness. Its shoots had spread out and gone as far as the sea. 9 That is why I will weep over the vine of Sibʹmah as I weep for Jaʹzer. With my tears I will drench you, O Heshʹbon and E·le·aʹleh, + Because the shouting over your summer fruit and your harvest has ended. * 10 Rejoicing and joyfulness have been taken away from the orchard, And there are no songs of joy or shouting in the vineyards. + The treader no longer treads out wine in the presses, For I have caused the shouting to cease. + 11 That is why deep within me I am boisterous over Moʹab, + Like the strumming of a harp, And my innermost being over Kir-harʹe·seth. + 12 Even when Moʹab wears himself out on the high place and goes to pray in his sanctuary, he will accomplish nothing. + 13 This is the word that Jehovah previously spoke concerning Moʹab. 14 And now Jehovah says: “Within three years, like the years of a hired worker, * the glory of Moʹab will be disgraced with much tumult of every sort, and those who remain will be very few and insignificant.” + Footnotes ^ Or “its branches laden with red grapes.” ^ Or possibly, “Because the battle cry has descended on your summer fruit and your harvest.” ^ Or “counted as carefully as a hired worker does”; that is, in exactly three years.
