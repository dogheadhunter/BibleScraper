Isaiah 32:1-20 32 Look! A king + will reign for righteousness, + And princes will rule for justice. 2 And each one will be like a hiding place * from the wind, A place of concealment * from the rainstorm, Like streams of water in a waterless land, + Like the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land. 3 Then the eyes of those seeing will no longer be pasted shut, And the ears of those hearing will pay attention. 4 The heart of those who are impetuous will ponder over knowledge, And the stammering tongue will speak fluently and clearly. + 5 The senseless one will no longer be called generous, And the unprincipled man will not be called noble; 6 For the senseless one will speak nonsense, And his heart will devise harmful things, + To promote apostasy * and to speak what is wayward against Jehovah, To cause the hungry one * to go unfed And to deprive the thirsty one of something to drink. 7 The devices of the unprincipled man are bad; + He promotes shameful conduct To ruin the afflicted one with lies, + Even when the poor speaks what is right. 8 But the generous one has generous intentions, And in generous * endeavors he perseveres. 9 “You complacent women, get up and listen to my voice! You carefree daughters, + pay attention to what I say! 10 In a little over a year, you who are carefree will shudder, Because no fruit will have been gathered when the grape harvest ends. + 11 Tremble, you complacent women! Shudder, you who are carefree! Strip yourselves bare, And put sackcloth around your hips. + 12 Beat your breasts in lamentation Over the desirable fields and the fruitful vine. 13 For the ground of my people will be covered with thorns and briars; They will cover all the houses of rejoicing, Yes, the city of exultation. + 14 For the fortified tower has been forsaken; The noisy city has been abandoned. + Oʹphel + and the watchtower have become a permanent wasteland, A delight for wild donkeys, A pasture for the flocks, + 15 Until the spirit is poured out on us from above, + And the wilderness becomes an orchard, And the orchard is regarded as a forest. + 16 Then justice will reside in the wilderness, And righteousness will dwell in the orchard. + 17 The result of true righteousness will be peace, + And the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquility and security. + 18 My people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place, In secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places. + 19 But the hail will flatten the forest, And the city will be completely leveled. 20 Happy are you who sow seed alongside all waters, Who send out * the bull and the donkey.” + Footnotes ^ Or “a shelter.” ^ Or “A refuge.” ^ Or “act in an irreverent way.” ^ Or “the soul of the hungry one.” ^ Or “noble.” ^ Or “let loose.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
