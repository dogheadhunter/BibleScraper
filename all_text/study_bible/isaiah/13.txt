Isaiah 13:1-22 13 A pronouncement against Babylon + that Isaiah + the son of Aʹmoz saw in vision: 2 “Raise up a signal * + on a mountain of bare rocks. Call out to them, wave your hand, So that they may come into the entrances of the nobles. 3 I have issued the command to those whom I have appointed. * + I have summoned my warriors to express my anger, My proudly exultant ones. 4 Listen! A crowd in the mountains; It sounds like a numerous people! Listen! The uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! + Jehovah of armies is mustering the army for war. + 5 They are coming from a distant land, + From the extremity of the heavens, Jehovah and the weapons of his wrath, To bring ruin to all the earth. + 6 Wail, for the day of Jehovah is near! It will come as a destruction from the Almighty. + 7 That is why all hands will go limp, And every man’s heart will melt with fear. + 8 The people are panic-stricken. + They are seized with convulsions and pain, Like a woman in labor. They look at one another in horror, With faces inflamed by anguish. 9 Look! The day of Jehovah is coming, Cruel both with fury and with burning anger, To make the land an object of horror, + And to annihilate the land’s sinners from it. 10 For the stars of the heavens and their constellations * + Will not give off their light; The sun will be dark when it rises, And the moon will not shed its light. 11 I will call the inhabited earth to account for its badness, + And the wicked for their error. I will put an end to the pride of the presumptuous, And I will humble the haughtiness of tyrants. + 12 I will make mortal man scarcer than refined gold, + And humans scarcer than the gold of Oʹphir. + 13 That is why I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken out of its place + At the fury of Jehovah of armies in the day of his burning anger. 14 Like a hunted gazelle and like a flock with no one to gather them, Each will return to his own people; Each will flee to his own land. + 15 Whoever is found will be pierced through, And whoever is caught will fall by the sword. + 16 Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, + Their houses will be looted, And their wives will be raped. 17 Here I am raising up against them the Medes, + Who regard silver as nothing And who take no delight in gold. 18 Their bows will shatter young men; + They will show no pity on the fruit of the womb Nor mercy to children. 19 And Babylon, the most glorious * of kingdoms, + The beauty and the pride of the Chal·deʹans, + Will be like Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah when God overthrew them. + 20 She will never be inhabited, Nor will she be a place to reside in throughout all generations. + No Arab will pitch his tent there, And no shepherds will rest their flocks there. 21 The desert creatures will lie down there; Their houses will be filled with eagle owls. The ostriches will reside there, + And wild goats * will skip about there. 22 Howling creatures will cry out in her towers, And jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is near, and her days will not be prolonged.” + Footnotes ^ Or “signal pole.” ^ Lit., “to my sanctified ones.” ^ Lit., “and their Kesils,” perhaps referring to Orion and surrounding constellations. ^ Or “the decoration.” ^ Or possibly, “And goatlike demons.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
