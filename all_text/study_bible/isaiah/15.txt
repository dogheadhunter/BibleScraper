Isaiah 15:1-9 15 A pronouncement against Moʹab: + Because it has been devastated in a night, Ar + of Moʹab has been silenced. Because it has been devastated in a night, Kir + of Moʹab has been silenced. 2 He has gone up to the House * and to Diʹbon, + To the high places to weep. Moʹab wails over Neʹbo + and over Medʹe·ba. + Every head is shaved bald, + every beard is clipped. + 3 In its streets they have put on sackcloth. On their roofs and in their public squares they all wail; They go down weeping. + 4 Heshʹbon and E·le·aʹleh + cry out; Their voice is heard as far as Jaʹhaz. + That is why the armed men of Moʹab keep shouting. He * is trembling. 5 My heart cries out over Moʹab. Its fugitives have fled as far as Zoʹar + and Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah. + On the ascent of Luʹhith they weep as they go up; On the way to Hor·o·naʹim they cry out over the catastrophe. + 6 For the waters of Nimʹrim are desolate; The green grass has dried up, The grass is gone and nothing green is left. 7 That is why they are carrying away what is left of their stores and their riches; They are crossing the valley * of poplars. 8 For the outcry echoes throughout the territory of Moʹab. + The wailing reaches to Eg·laʹim; The wailing reaches to Beʹer-eʹlim. 9 For the waters of Diʹmon are full of blood, And I have more in store for Diʹmon: A lion for those of Moʹab who escape And for those remaining in the land. + Footnotes ^ Or “the Temple.” ^ Or “His soul.” ^ Or “wadi.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
