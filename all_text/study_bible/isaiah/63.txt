Isaiah 63:1-19 63 Who is this coming from Eʹdom, + From Bozʹrah + with bright-colored * garments, This one with splendid clothing, Marching in his great power? “It is I, the One speaking in righteousness, The One with great power to save.” 2 Why is your clothing red, And why are your garments like those of one treading the winepress? + 3 “I have trodden the wine trough alone. No one from the peoples was with me. I kept treading them in my anger, And I kept trampling them in my wrath. + My garments were spattered with their blood, And I have stained all my clothing. 4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, + And the year of my repurchased ones has come. 5 I looked, but there was no one to help; I was appalled that no one offered support. So my arm brought me salvation, * + And my own wrath supported me. 6 I trampled peoples in my anger, I made them drunk with my wrath + And poured out their blood on the ground.” 7 I will mention Jehovah’s acts of loyal love, The praiseworthy acts of Jehovah, Because of all that Jehovah has done for us, + The many good things he has done for the house of Israel, According to his mercy and his great loyal love. 8 For he said: “Surely they are my people, sons who will not be disloyal.” * + So he became their Savior. + 9 During all their distress it was distressing to him. + And his own personal messenger * saved them. + In his love and compassion he repurchased them, + And he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. + 10 But they rebelled + and grieved his holy spirit. + He then turned into their enemy, + And he fought against them. + 11 And they remembered the days of old, The days of Moses his servant: “Where is the One who brought them up out of the sea + with the shepherds of his flock? + Where is the One who put within him His holy spirit, + 12 The One who made His glorious arm go with the right hand of Moses, + The One who split the waters before them + To make an everlasting name for himself, + 13 The One who made them walk through the surging waters, * So that they walked without stumbling, Like a horse in the open country? * 14 Just like livestock when they go down into the valley plain, The spirit of Jehovah made them rest.” + This is how you led your people, To make a majestic * name for yourself. + 15 Look down from heaven and see From your lofty abode of holiness and glory. * Where are your zeal and your mightiness, The stirring of your compassions * + and your mercy? + They are withheld from me. 16 For you are our Father; + Although Abraham may not know us And Israel may not recognize us, You, O Jehovah, are our Father. Our Repurchaser of long ago is your name. + 17 Why do you, O Jehovah, let us * wander from your ways? Why do you let * our hearts become hard, so that we do not fear you? + Return, for the sake of your servants, The tribes of your inheritance. + 18 Your holy people possessed it for a short time. Our adversaries have trampled on your sanctuary. + 19 For too long we have become like those you never ruled over, Like those never called by your name.
