Isaiah 56:1-12 56 This is what Jehovah says: “Uphold justice, + and do what is righteous, For my salvation will soon come And my righteousness will be revealed. + 2 Happy is the man who does this And the son of man who holds fast to it, Who keeps the Sabbath and does not profane it + And who holds his hand back from any kind of evil. 3 The foreigner who joins himself to Jehovah + should not say, ‘Jehovah will surely separate me from his people.’ And the eunuch should not say, ‘Look! I am a dried-up tree.’” 4 For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant: 5 “I will give to them in my house and within my walls a monument and a name, Something better than sons and daughters. An everlasting name I will give them, One that will not perish. 6 As for the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah to minister to him, To love the name of Jehovah + And to be his servants, All those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it And who hold fast to my covenant, 7 I will also bring them to my holy mountain + And make them rejoice inside my house of prayer. Their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar. For my house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.” + 8 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah, who is gathering the dispersed ones of Israel, + declares: “I will gather to him others besides those already gathered.” + 9 All you wild animals of the field, come to eat, All you wild animals in the forest. + 10 His watchmen are blind, + none of them have taken note. + All of them are speechless dogs, unable to bark. + They are panting and lying down; they love to slumber. 11 They are dogs with a voracious appetite; * They are never satisfied. They are shepherds who have no understanding. + They have all gone their own way; Every last one of them seeks his own dishonest gain and says: 12 “Come, let me take some wine, And let us drink our fill of alcohol. + And tomorrow will be like today, only far better!” Footnotes ^ Or “with a strong soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
