Isaiah 38:1-22 38 In those days Hez·e·kiʹah became sick and was at the point of death. + The prophet Isaiah + the son of Aʹmoz came and said to him, “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Give instructions to your household, for you will die; you will not recover.’” + 2 At that Hez·e·kiʹah turned his face to the wall and began to pray to Jehovah: 3 “I beg you, O Jehovah, remember, + please, how I have walked before you faithfully and with a complete heart, + and I have done what was good in your eyes.” And Hez·e·kiʹah began to weep profusely. 4 Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying: 5 “Go back and say to Hez·e·kiʹah, + ‘This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says: “I have heard your prayer. + I have seen your tears. + Here I am adding 15 years to your life, * + 6 and I will rescue you and this city out of the hand of the king of As·syrʹi·a, and I will defend this city. + 7 This is the sign from Jehovah to show you that Jehovah will carry out the word that he has spoken: + 8 Here I will make the declining shadow of the sun on the stairway * of Aʹhaz go back ten steps.”’” + So the sun went back ten steps on the stairway that it had already descended. 9 A writing * of King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah when he became sick and recovered from his sickness. 10 I said: “In the middle of my life I must go into the gates of the Grave. * I will be deprived of my remaining years.” 11 I said: “I will not see Jah, * Jah in the land of the living. + I will look no more on mankind When I am with the inhabitants of the place where everything ceases. 12 My own dwelling has been pulled out and removed from me + Like the tent of a shepherd. I have rolled up my life like a loom worker; He cuts me off like the threads of the warp. From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end. + 13 I calm myself until the morning. Like a lion, he keeps breaking all my bones; From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end. + 14 Like the swift or the thrush, * so I keep chirping; + I keep cooing like the dove. + My eyes look wearily to the height: + ‘O Jehovah, I am in great distress; Be my support!’ * + 15 What can I say? He has spoken to me and acted. I will walk humbly * all my years Because of my bitter distress. * 16 ‘O Jehovah, by these things * every man lives, And in them is the life of my spirit. You will restore me to health and preserve me alive. + 17 Look! Instead of peace, I had great bitterness; But in your fondness for me, * You preserved me from the pit of destruction. + You have thrown all my sins behind your back. * + 18 For the Grave * cannot glorify you, + Death cannot praise you. + Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. + 19 The living, the living can praise you, Just as I can this day. A father can give his sons knowledge about your faithfulness. + 20 O Jehovah, save me, And we will play my songs on stringed instruments + All the days of our life at the house of Jehovah.’” + 21 Isaiah then said: “Bring a cake of pressed dried figs and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.” + 22 Hez·e·kiʹah had asked: “What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Jehovah?” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “days.” ^ Perhaps these stairs were used to count time, as on a sundial. ^ Or “composition.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
