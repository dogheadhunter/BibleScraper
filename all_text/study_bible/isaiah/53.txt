Isaiah 53:1-12 53 Who has put faith in the thing heard from us? * + And as for the arm of Jehovah, + to whom has it been revealed? + 2 He will come up like a twig + before him, * like a root out of parched land. No stately form does he have, nor any splendor; + And when we see him, his appearance does not draw us to him. * 3 He was despised and was avoided by men, + A man who was meant for * pains and was familiar with sickness. It was as if his face were hidden from us. * He was despised, and we held him as of no account. + 4 Truly he himself carried our sicknesses, + And he bore our pains. + But we considered him as plagued, stricken by God and afflicted. 5 But he was pierced + for our transgression; + He was crushed for our errors. + He bore the punishment for our peace, + And because of his wounds we were healed. + 6 Like sheep we have all wandered about, + Each has turned his own way, And Jehovah has caused the error of us all to meet up with him. + 7 He was oppressed + and he let himself be afflicted, + But he would not open his mouth. He was brought like a sheep to the slaughter, + Like a ewe that is silent before its shearers, And he would not open his mouth. + 8 Because of restraint * and judgment he was taken away; And who will concern himself with the details of his generation? * For he was cut off from the land of the living; + Because of the transgression of my people he received the stroke. * + 9 And he was given a burial place * with the wicked, + And with the rich * in his death, + Although he had done no wrong * And there was no deception in his mouth. + 10 But it was Jehovah’s will * to crush him, and he let him become sick. If you will present his life * as a guilt offering, + He will see his offspring, * he will prolong his days, + And through him the delight * of Jehovah will have success. + 11 Because of his anguish, * he will see and be satisfied. By means of his knowledge the righteous one, my servant, + Will bring a righteous standing to many people, + And their errors he will bear. + 12 For that reason I will assign him a portion among the many, And he will apportion the spoil with the mighty, Because he poured out his life * even to death + And was counted among the transgressors; + He carried the sin of many people, + And he interceded for the transgressors. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “in what we heard?” ^ “Him” could refer to an observer in general or to God. ^ Or “there is no special appearance that we should desire him.” ^ Or “who understood.” ^ Or possibly, “He was like someone from whom people turned their faces.” ^ Or “was struck dead.” ^ Or “his manner of life?” ^ Or “oppression.” ^ Or “And one will give his burial place.” ^ Lit., “a rich man.” ^ Or “no violence.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “will; good pleasure.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “But Jehovah took delight.” ^ Or “the trouble of his soul.” ^ Or “soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
