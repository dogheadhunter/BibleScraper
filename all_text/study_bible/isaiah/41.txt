Isaiah 41:1-29 41 “Listen to me in silence, * you islands; Let the nations regain their strength. Let them approach; then let them speak. + Let us come together for judgment. 2 Who has raised up someone from the sunrise, * + Calling him in righteousness to His feet, * To hand over nations to him And to make him subdue kings? + Who reduces them to dust before his sword, Like windblown stubble before his bow? 3 He pursues them, passing along unhindered Over paths that his feet have not traveled. 4 Who has acted and done this, Summoning the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, am the First One; + And with the last ones I am the same.” + 5 The islands have seen it and have become afraid. The ends of the earth began to tremble. They draw near and come forward. 6 Each one helps his companion And says to his brother: “Be strong.” 7 So the craftsman strengthens the metalworker; + The one who flattens with the forge hammer Strengthens the one hammering at the anvil. He says about the soldering: “It is good.” Then it is fastened with nails so that it will not topple over. 8 “But you, O Israel, are my servant, + You, O Jacob, whom I have chosen, + The offspring * of Abraham my friend, + 9 You, whom I took from the ends of the earth, + And you, whom I called from its most distant parts. I said to you, ‘You are my servant; + I have chosen you; I have not rejected you. + 10 Do not be afraid, for I am with you. + Do not be anxious, for I am your God. + I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, + I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.’ 11 Look! All those getting enraged against you will be put to shame and humiliated. + Those who fight with you will be brought to nothing and perish. + 12 You will search for men who struggle with you, but you will not find them; The men at war with you will become as something nonexistent, as nothing at all. + 13 For I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand, The One saying to you, ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you.’ + 14 Do not be afraid, you worm * Jacob, + You men of Israel, I will help you,” declares Jehovah, your Repurchaser, + the Holy One of Israel. 15 “Look! I have made you a threshing sledge, + A new threshing instrument with double-edged teeth. You will tread down the mountains and crush them And make the hills like chaff. 16 You will winnow them, And the wind will carry them away; A windstorm will scatter them. You will be joyful in Jehovah, + And you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.” + 17 “The needy and the poor are seeking water, but there is none. Their tongue is dry from thirst. + I, Jehovah, will answer them. + I, the God of Israel, will not abandon them. + 18 I will make rivers flow on the bare hills + And springs in the valley plains. + I will turn the wilderness into a reedy pool of water And the waterless land into springs of water. + 19 In the desert I will plant the cedar tree, The acacia and the myrtle and the pine tree. + In the desert plain I will plant the juniper tree, Together with the ash and the cypress tree, + 20 So that all people may see and know And pay attention and understand That the hand of Jehovah has done this, And the Holy One of Israel has created it.” + 21 “Present your case,” says Jehovah. “Produce your arguments,” says the King of Jacob. 22 “Produce evidence and tell us the things that will happen. Do tell us about the former * things, So that we may reflect on them * and know their outcome. Or declare to us the things that are coming. + 23 Tell us what will happen in the future, So that we may know that you are gods. + Yes, do something, good or bad, So that we may be amazed when we see it. + 24 Look! You are something nonexistent, And your achievement is nothing. + Anyone who chooses you is detestable. + 25 I have raised up someone from the north, and he will come, + One from the rising of the sun * + who will call on my name. He will trample rulers * as if they were clay, + Like a potter who treads moist clay. 26 Who told about this from the beginning, so that we could know, Or from times past, so that we could say, ‘He is right’? + Indeed, no one announced it! No one declared it! No one heard anything from you!” + 27 I was the first to say to Zion: “Look! Here they are!” + And to Jerusalem I will send a bearer of good news. + 28 But I kept looking, and there was no one; There was not one among them to give advice. And I kept asking them to reply. 29 Look! All of them are a delusion. * Their works are nothing. Their metal images * are wind and unreality. + Footnotes ^ Or “Keep silence before me.” ^ Or “from the east.” ^ That is, to serve Him. ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ That is, defenseless and lowly. ^ Lit., “first.” ^ Or “apply our heart.” ^ Or “from the east.” ^ Or “deputy rulers.” ^ Or “something nonexistent.” ^ Or “molten statues.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
