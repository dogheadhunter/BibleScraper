Isaiah 29:1-24 29 “Woe to Arʹi·el, * Arʹi·el, the city where David encamped! + Continue year after year; Let the cycle of festivals + continue. 2 But I will bring distress on Arʹi·el, + And there will be mourning and lamentation, + And she will become to me like an altar hearth of God. + 3 I will encamp on all sides against you, And I will besiege you with a palisade And raise up siegeworks against you. + 4 You will be brought low; From the ground you will speak, And what you say will be muffled by dust. Your voice will come from the ground + Like the voice of a spirit medium, And your words will chirp from the dust. 5 The crowd of your enemies * will be like fine powder, + The crowd of the tyrants just like the blowing chaff. + And it will happen in an instant, suddenly. + 6 Jehovah of armies will give you his attention With thunder and earthquake and a great noise, With storm wind and tempest and the flames of a consuming fire.” + 7 Then the crowd of all the nations waging war against Arʹi·el + —All those waging war against her, The siege towers against her, And those bringing distress on her— Will become like a dream, a vision of the night. 8 Yes, it will be just as when someone hungry dreams that he is eating, But he wakes up hungry, * And as when someone thirsty dreams that he is drinking, But he wakes up tired and thirsty. * So it will happen with the crowd of all the nations That wage war against Mount Zion. + 9 Be stunned and amazed; + Blind yourselves and be blinded. + They are drunk, but not with wine; They are staggering, but not from alcohol. 10 For Jehovah has poured a spirit of deep sleep on you; + He has closed your eyes, the prophets, + And he has covered your heads, the visionaries. + 11 Every vision becomes for you like the words of a sealed book. + When they give it to someone who can read, saying: “Read this out loud, please,” he will say: “I cannot, for it is sealed up.” 12 And when they give the book to someone who cannot read, saying: “Read this, please,” he will say: “I cannot read at all.” 13 Jehovah says: “This people approach me with their mouth And they honor me with their lips, + But their heart is far removed from me; And their fear of me is based on commands of men that they have been taught. + 14 Therefore, I am the One who will again do wonderful things with this people, + With wonder upon wonder; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the understanding of their discreet men will be hidden.” + 15 Woe to those who go to great lengths to conceal their plans * from Jehovah. + Their deeds are done in a dark place, While they say: “Who sees us? Who knows about us?” + 16 How you twist things! * Should the potter be regarded the same as the clay? + Should what is made say about its maker: “He did not make me”? + And does what is formed say about its former: “He shows no understanding”? + 17 In just a short time, Lebʹa·non will be turned into an orchard, + And the orchard will be regarded as a forest. + 18 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the book, And out of the gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. + 19 The meek will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, And the poor among men will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel. + 20 For the tyrant will be no more, The boaster will come to his finish, And all those keeping alert to do harm will be destroyed, + 21 Those who with a false word make others guilty, Who lay traps for the defender * in the city gate, + And who with empty arguments deny justice to the righteous one. + 22 So this is what Jehovah, who redeemed Abraham, + says to the house of Jacob: “Jacob will no longer be ashamed, And no more will his face grow pale. * + 23 For when he sees his children, Who are the work of my hands, in his midst, + They will sanctify my name; Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, And they will stand in awe of the God of Israel. + 24 Those who are wayward in spirit will acquire understanding, And those who complain will accept instruction.” Footnotes ^ Possibly meaning “The Altar Hearth of God,” apparently referring to Jerusalem. ^ Lit., “strangers.” ^ Or “and his soul is empty.” ^ Or “and his soul is parched.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “How perverse of you!” ^ Lit., “the one reproving.” ^ That is, from shame and disappointment.
