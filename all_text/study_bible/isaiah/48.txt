Isaiah 48:1-22 48 Hear this, O house of Jacob, You who call yourselves by the name of Israel + And who have come from the waters of * Judah, You who swear by the name of Jehovah + And who call on the God of Israel, Though not in truth and righteousness. + 2 For they call themselves after the holy city + And seek the support of the God of Israel, + Whose name is Jehovah of armies. 3 “The former * things I told you long ago. From my own mouth they went out, And I made them known. + Suddenly I took action, and they came about. + 4 Because I knew how stubborn you are —That your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead is copper + — 5 I told you long ago. Before it came about, I caused you to hear it, So that you could not say, ‘My idol did this; My carved image and my metal image * commanded this.’ 6 You have heard and seen all of this. Will you not declare it? + From now on I am announcing new things to you, + Guarded secrets that you have not known. 7 Only now are they being created, and not long ago, Things that you never heard before today, So that you cannot say, ‘Look! I already know them.’ 8 No, you have not heard, + you have not known, And in the past your ears were not opened. For I know that you are very treacherous, + And you have been called a transgressor from birth. + 9 But for the sake of my name I will hold back my anger; + For my own praise I will restrain myself toward you, And I will not do away with you. + 10 Look! I have refined you, but not in the form of silver. + I have tested * you in the smelting furnace of affliction. + 11 For my own sake, for my own sake I will act, + For how could I let myself be profaned? + I give my glory to no one else. * 12 Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel, whom I have called. I am the same One. + I am the first; I am also the last. + 13 My own hand laid the foundation of the earth, + And my right hand spread out the heavens. + When I call to them, they stand up together. 14 Gather together, all of you, and listen. Who among them has announced these things? Jehovah has loved him. + He will carry out his delight against Babylon, + And his arm will come against the Chal·deʹans. + 15 I myself have spoken, and I have called him. + I have brought him, and his way will be successful. + 16 Come near to me, and hear this. From the very start I have not spoken in secret. + From the time it happened I was there.” And now the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has sent me, and * his spirit. 17 This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel: + “I, Jehovah, am your God, The One teaching you to benefit yourself, * + The One guiding you in the way you should walk. + 18 If only you would pay attention to my commandments! + Then your peace would become just like a river + And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. + 19 Your offspring * would be as many as the sand And your descendants as its grains. + Their name would never be cut off or annihilated from before me.” 20 Go out from Babylon! + Flee from the Chal·deʹans! Announce it with a joyful cry! Proclaim it! + Make it known to the ends of the earth. + Say: “Jehovah has repurchased his servant Jacob. + 21 They did not become thirsty when he led them through devastated places. + He caused water to flow out of the rock for them; He split a rock and made water gush out.” + 22 “There is no peace,” says Jehovah, “for the wicked.” + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “who are descended from.” ^ Lit., “first.” ^ Or “molten statue.” ^ Or “examined.” Or possibly, “chosen.” ^ Or “I do not share my glory with anyone else.” ^ Or “along with.” ^ Or “for your own good.” ^ Lit., “seed.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
