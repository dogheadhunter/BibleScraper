Jonah 2:1-10 2 Then Joʹnah prayed to Jehovah his God from the belly of the fish, + 2 and he said: “Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he answered me. + Out of the depths * of the Grave * I cried for help. + You heard my voice. 3 When you threw me to the depths, into the heart of the open sea, Then the currents engulfed me. + All your breakers and waves swept over me. + 4 And I said, ‘I have been driven away from your sight! How will I gaze again upon your holy temple?’ 5 Waters engulfed me and threatened my life; * + The watery deep closed in on me. Weeds were wrapped around my head. 6 To the bottoms of the mountains I sank down. The bars of the earth were closing upon me forever. But out of the pit you brought up my life, O Jehovah my God. + 7 When my life * was ebbing away, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered. + Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. + 8 Those who are devoted to the worthless idols forsake their source of loyal love. * 9 But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will pay. + Salvation is from Jehovah.” + 10 In time Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Joʹnah out onto the dry land.
