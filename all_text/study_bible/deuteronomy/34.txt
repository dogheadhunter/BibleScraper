Deuteronomy 34:1-12 34 Then Moses went up from the desert plains of Moʹab to Mount Neʹbo, + to the top of Pisʹgah, + which faces Jerʹi·cho. + And Jehovah showed him all the land, from Gilʹe·ad to Dan, + 2 and all Naphʹta·li and the land of Eʹphra·im and Ma·nasʹseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, * + 3 and the Negʹeb + and the District, + the valley plain of Jerʹi·cho, the city of the palm trees, as far as Zoʹar. + 4 Jehovah then said to him: “This is the land about which I have sworn to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your offspring * I will give it.’ + I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross over there.” + 5 After that Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moʹab just as Jehovah had said. + 6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moʹab, opposite Beth-peʹor, and nobody knows where his grave is down to this day. + 7 Moses was 120 years old at his death. + His eyes had not grown dim, and his strength had not departed. 8 The people of Israel wept for Moses on the desert plains of Moʹab for 30 days. + Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were completed. 9 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hand on him; + and the Israelites began to listen to him, and they did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. + 10 But there has never again arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, + whom Jehovah knew face-to-face. + 11 He performed all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharʹaoh and all his servants and all his land, + 12 along with the mighty hand and the awesome power that Moses displayed before the eyes of all Israel. + Footnotes ^ That is, the Great Sea, the Mediterranean. ^ Lit., “seed.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
