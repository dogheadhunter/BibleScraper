Deuteronomy 33:1-29 33 Now this is the blessing that Moses the man of the true God pronounced on the Israelites before his death. + 2 He said: “Jehovah—from Siʹnai he came, + And he shone upon them from Seʹir. He shone forth in glory from the mountainous region of Paʹran, + And with him were holy myriads, * + At his right hand his warriors. + 3 He had affection for his people; + All their holy ones are in your hand. + They were sitting at your feet; + They began to listen to your words. + 4 (Moses gave us a command, a law, + As a possession of the congregation of Jacob.) + 5 And He became king in Jeshʹu·run, * + When the heads of the people gathered together, + Along with all the tribes of Israel. + 6 Let Reuʹben live and not die off, + And may his men not become few.” + 7 And he pronounced this blessing on Judah: + “Hear, O Jehovah, the voice of Judah, + And may you bring him back to his people. His arms have defended * what belongs to him, And may you help him against his adversaries.” + 8 Of Leʹvi he said: + “Your * Thumʹmim and your Uʹrim + belong to the man loyal to you, + Whom you put to the test at Masʹsah. + You began to contend with him by the waters of Merʹi·bah, + 9 The man who said to his father and his mother, ‘I have not shown regard to them.’ Even his brothers he did not acknowledge, + And he ignored his own sons. For they kept your word, And they observed your covenant. + 10 Let them instruct Jacob in your judicial decisions + And Israel in your Law. + Let them offer up incense as a pleasant aroma for you * + And a whole offering on your altar. + 11 Bless, O Jehovah, his strength, And may you show pleasure in the work of his hands. Crush the legs * of those who rise up against him, So that those who hate him may rise up no more.” 12 Of Benjamin he said: + “Let the beloved one of Jehovah reside in security by him; While he shelters him the whole day, He will reside between his shoulders.” 13 Of Joseph he said: + “May his land be blessed by Jehovah + With the choice things of heaven, With dew and the waters from the springs below, + 14 With choice things produced by the sun And the choice yield each month, + 15 With the choicest things from the ancient mountains * + And choice things of the enduring hills, 16 With the choice things of the earth and what fills it, + And with the approval of the One residing in the thornbush. + May they come upon the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of the one singled out from his brothers. + 17 His splendor is like that of a firstborn bull, And his horns are the horns of a wild bull. With them he will push * peoples All together to the ends of the earth. They are the tens of thousands of Eʹphra·im, + And they are the thousands of Ma·nasʹseh.” 18 Of Zebʹu·lun he said: + “Rejoice, O Zebʹu·lun, in your going out, And you, Isʹsa·char, in your tents. + 19 They will call peoples to the mountain. There they will offer the sacrifices of righteousness. For they will draw from the abundant wealth of * the seas And the hidden hoards * of the sand.” 20 Of Gad he said: + “Blessed is the one widening the borders of Gad. + He lies there like a lion, Ready to tear off the arm, yes, the crown of the head. 21 He will select the first portion for himself, + For there the allotment of a lawgiver is reserved. + The heads of the people will gather together. The righteousness of Jehovah he will execute, And his judicial decisions with Israel.” 22 Of Dan he said: + “Dan is a lion cub. + He will leap out from Baʹshan.” + 23 Of Naphʹta·li he said: + “Naphʹta·li is satisfied with the approval And full of the blessing of Jehovah. Take possession of the west and south.” 24 Of Ashʹer he said: + “Blessed with sons is Ashʹer. May he be favored by his brothers, And may he dip * his feet in oil. 25 Iron and copper are your gate locks, + And you will be secure all your days. * 26 There is none like the true God + of Jeshʹu·run, + Who rides through heaven to help you And who rides upon the clouds in his majesty. + 27 God is a refuge from ancient times, + His everlasting arms are beneath you. + And he will drive away the enemy from before you, + And he will say, ‘Annihilate them!’ + 28 Israel will reside in security, And the fountain of Jacob will be secluded In a land of grain and new wine, + Whose skies will drip with dew. + 29 Happy you are, O Israel! + Who is there like you, + A people enjoying salvation in Jehovah, + Your protective shield + And your majestic sword? Your enemies will cringe before you, + And you will tread on their backs.” * Footnotes ^ Or “were tens of thousands of holy ones.” ^ Meaning “Upright One,” an honorary title for Israel. ^ Or “contended for.” ^ “Your” and “you” in this verse refer to God. ^ Lit., “in your nose.” ^ Or “hips.” ^ Or possibly, “the mountains of the east.” ^ Or “gore.” ^ Lit., “will suck the abundance of.” ^ Or “treasures.” ^ Or “bathe.” ^ Lit., “And like your days will be your strength.” ^ Or possibly, “high places.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
