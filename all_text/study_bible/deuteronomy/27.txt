Deuteronomy 27:1-26 27 Then Moses together with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying: “Observe every commandment that I am giving you today. 2 And in the day when you will cross the Jordan into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, set up large stones and cover them with plaster. * + 3 Then write on them all the words of this Law when you have crossed over, so that you may enter into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as Jehovah, the God of your forefathers, has promised you. + 4 When you have crossed the Jordan, you should set up these stones on Mount Eʹbal + and cover them with plaster, * just as I am commanding you today. 5 You are also to build an altar there to Jehovah your God, an altar of stones. You should not use iron tools on them. + 6 You should build the altar of Jehovah your God with whole stones and offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it. 7 You are to offer communion sacrifices + and eat them there, + and you will rejoice before Jehovah your God. + 8 And clearly write on the stones all the words of this Law.” + 9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: “Keep silent and listen, O Israel. This day you have become the people of Jehovah your God. + 10 You must listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and carry out his commandments + and his regulations, which I am commanding you today.” 11 On that day Moses commanded the people, saying: 12 “The following tribes will stand on Mount Gerʹi·zim + to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simʹe·on, Leʹvi, Judah, Isʹsa·char, Joseph, and Benjamin. 13 And the following will stand on Mount Eʹbal + to pronounce the curse: Reuʹben, Gad, Ashʹer, Zebʹu·lun, Dan, and Naphʹta·li. 14 And the Levites will answer every man of Israel with a loud voice: + 15 “‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved image + or a metal statue, * + a thing detestable to Jehovah, + the workmanship of the hands of a craftsman, * and who has hidden it.’ (And all the people will respond, saying, ‘Amen!’ * ) 16 “‘Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 17 “‘Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor’s boundary marker.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 18 “‘Cursed is the one who causes a blind person to lose his way on the road.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 19 “‘Cursed is the one who perverts the judgment + of a foreign resident, a fatherless child, * or a widow.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 20 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his father’s wife, for he has dishonored his father.’ * + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 21 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with any animal.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 22 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 23 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his mother-in-law.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 24 “‘Cursed is the one who ambushes and kills his neighbor.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 25 “‘Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to kill * an innocent person.’ * + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) 26 “‘Cursed is the one who will not uphold the words of this Law by carrying them out.’ + (And all the people will say, ‘Amen!’) Footnotes ^ Or “whitewash them with lime.” ^ Or “whitewash them with lime.” ^ Or “So be it!” ^ Or “a wood-and-metal worker.” ^ Or “molten statue.” ^ Or “an orphan.” ^ Lit., “uncovered the skirt of his father.” ^ Or “strike down.” ^ Or “a soul of innocent blood.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
