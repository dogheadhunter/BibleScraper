Proverbs 29:1-27 29 A man who stiffens his neck * after much reproof + Will suddenly be broken beyond healing. + 2 When the righteous are many, the people rejoice, But when the wicked one rules, the people groan. + 3 A man who loves wisdom makes his father rejoice, + But the one who keeps company with prostitutes squanders his wealth. + 4 By justice a king brings stability to a land, + But a man seeking bribes brings it to ruin. 5 A man who flatters his neighbor Spreads out a net for his feet. + 6 A bad man’s transgression ensnares him, + But the righteous one cries out joyfully and rejoices. + 7 The righteous one is concerned about the legal rights of the poor, + But the wicked one has no such concern. + 8 Boastful men inflame a town, + But those who are wise turn away anger. + 9 When a wise man enters into a controversy with a fool, There will be ranting and ridicule, but no satisfaction. + 10 Bloodthirsty men hate anyone innocent, * + And they seek to take the life * of the upright. * 11 A stupid person gives vent to all his feelings, * + But the wise one calmly keeps them in check. + 12 When a ruler pays attention to lies, All his servants will be wicked. + 13 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common: * Jehovah gives light to the eyes of both. * 14 When a king judges the poor fairly, + His throne will always be secure. + 15 The rod * and reproof impart wisdom, + But a child left unrestrained brings shame on his mother. 16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases, But the righteous will see their downfall. + 17 Discipline your son and he will bring you rest; And he will give you * great pleasure. + 18 Where there is no vision, * the people go unrestrained, + But happy are those who observe the law. + 19 A servant will not let himself be corrected by words, For though he understands, he does not obey. + 20 Have you seen a man hasty with his words? + There is more hope for a fool than for him. + 21 If a servant is pampered from his youth, He will become thankless later on. 22 A man prone to anger stirs up strife; + Anyone disposed to rage commits many transgressions. + 23 The haughtiness of a man will humble him, + But whoever is humble in spirit will obtain glory. + 24 The partner of a thief hates himself. * He may hear the call to testify, * but he reports nothing. + 25 Trembling at * men is * a snare, + But the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected. + 26 Many seek an audience with * a ruler, But it is from Jehovah that a man gets justice. + 27 An unjust man is detestable to the righteous, + But the one whose way is upright is detestable to the wicked one. + Footnotes ^ Or “who remains stubborn.” ^ Or “blameless.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or possibly, “But the upright seeks to protect his life.” ^ Lit., “spirit.” ^ Lit., “meet together.” ^ That is, He gives them life. ^ Or “discipline; punishment.” ^ Or “your soul.” ^ Or “prophetic vision; revelation.” ^ Or “his own soul.” ^ Or “an oath involving a curse.” ^ Or “Fear of.” ^ Or “lays.” ^ Or possibly, “seek the favor of.” Lit., “seek the face of.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
