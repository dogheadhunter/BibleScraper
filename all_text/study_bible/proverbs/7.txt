Proverbs 7:1-27 7 My son, keep my sayings, And treasure up my commandments. + 2 Keep my commandments and live; + Guard my instruction * like the pupil of your eye. 3 Tie them around your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. + 4 Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” And call understanding “my relative,” 5 To guard you against the wayward * woman, + Against the immoral * woman and her smooth * words. + 6 From the window of my house, Through my lattice, I looked down, 7 And as I observed the naive * ones, I discerned among the youths a young man lacking good sense. * + 8 He passed along the street near her corner, And he marched in the direction of her house 9 In the twilight, in the evening, + At the approach of night and darkness. 10 Then I saw a woman meet him, Dressed like * a prostitute, + with a cunning heart. 11 She is loud and defiant. + She never stays * at home. 12 One moment she is outside, next she is in the public squares, She lurks near every corner. + 13 She grabs hold of him and gives him a kiss; With a bold face, she says to him: 14 “I had to offer communion sacrifices. + Today I paid my vows. 15 That is why I came out to meet you, To look for you, and I found you! 16 I have spread fine covers upon my bed, Colorful linen from Egypt. + 17 I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. + 18 Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning; Let us enjoy passionate love together, 19 For my husband is not at home; He has gone on a distant journey. 20 He took a bag of money with him, And he will not return until the day of the full moon.” 21 She misleads him with great persuasiveness. + She seduces him with smooth speech. 22 Suddenly he goes after her, like a bull to the slaughter, Like a fool to be punished in the stocks, * + 23 Until an arrow pierces his liver; Like a bird rushing into a trap, he does not know that it will cost him his life. * + 24 And now, my sons, listen to me; Pay attention to the words I speak. 25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways. Do not stray onto her paths, + 26 For she has caused many to fall down slain, + And those she has killed are numerous. + 27 Her house leads to the Grave; * It goes down to the inner chambers of death.
