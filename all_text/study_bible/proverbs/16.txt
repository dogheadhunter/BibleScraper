Proverbs 16:1-33 16 A man prepares the thoughts of his heart, * But the answer he gives * is from Jehovah. + 2 All of a man’s ways seem right * to him, + But Jehovah examines the motives. * + 3 Commit to Jehovah whatever you do, * + And your plans will succeed. 4 Jehovah has made everything work for his purpose, Even the wicked for the day of disaster. + 5 Everyone proud in heart is detestable to Jehovah. + Be assured * that he will not go unpunished. 6 By loyal love and faithfulness, error is atoned for, + And by fearing Jehovah one turns away from bad. + 7 When Jehovah is pleased with a man’s ways, He causes even his enemies to be at peace with him. + 8 Better is a little with righteousness + Than a large income without justice. + 9 A man may plot out his course in his heart, But it is Jehovah who directs his steps. + 10 Inspired * decision should be on the lips of a king; + He must never betray justice. + 11 Honest balances and scales are from Jehovah; All the weights in the bag are his doing. + 12 Wicked practices are detestable to kings, + For the throne is firmly established by righteousness. + 13 Righteous speech is a pleasure to kings. They love someone who speaks honestly. + 14 The king’s rage is like a messenger of death, + But the wise man appeases * it. + 15 In the light of the king’s face there is life; His favor is like a cloud of rain in spring. + 16 How much better to acquire wisdom than gold! + To gain understanding is to be chosen over silver. + 17 The highway of the upright avoids what is bad. Whoever safeguards his way preserves his life. * + 18 Pride is before a crash, And a haughty spirit before stumbling. + 19 Better to be humble * among the meek + Than to share the spoil of the haughty. 20 The one who shows insight in a matter will find success, * And happy is the one trusting in Jehovah. 21 The wise in heart will be called understanding, + And the one kind in speech * adds persuasiveness. + 22 Insight is a fountain of life to those possessing it, But fools are disciplined by their own foolishness. 23 The heart of the wise one gives his mouth insight + And adds persuasiveness to his speech. 24 Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul * and a healing to the bones. + 25 There is a way that seems right to a man, But in the end it leads to death. + 26 The appetite * of a laborer makes him work hard For his hunger * urges him on. + 27 A worthless man digs up what is bad; + His speech is like a scorching fire. + 28 A troublemaker * causes dissension, + And a slanderer separates close friends. + 29 A violent man entices his neighbor And leads him in the wrong way. 30 He winks his eye as he schemes harm. He pinches his lips together as he carries out mischief. 31 Gray hair is a crown of beauty * + When it is found in the way of righteousness. + 32 The one slow to anger + is better than a mighty man, And the one controlling his temper * than one conquering a city. + 33 The lot is cast into the lap, + But every decision by it is from Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “the right answer.” Lit., “the answer of the tongue.” ^ Lit., “The arrangings of the heart belong to a man.” ^ Lit., “pure.” ^ Lit., “spirits.” ^ Lit., “Roll to Jehovah your works.” ^ Lit., “Hand to hand.” ^ Or “Divine.” ^ Or “avoids.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “lowly of spirit.” ^ Lit., “good.” ^ Or “And appealing speech.” Lit., “And sweetness of lips.” ^ Or “taste.” See Glossary . ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ Or “A schemer.” ^ Or “glory.” ^ Lit., “ruling over his spirit.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
