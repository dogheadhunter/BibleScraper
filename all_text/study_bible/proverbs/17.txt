Proverbs 17:1-28 17 Better is a piece of dry bread where there is peace * + Than a house full of feasting * along with quarreling. + 2 A servant with insight will rule over a son who acts shamefully; He will share in the inheritance as one of the brothers. 3 The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, + But Jehovah is the examiner of hearts. + 4 A wicked man pays attention to hurtful speech, And a deceptive man listens to a malicious tongue. + 5 Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker, + And whoever rejoices over another’s disaster will not go unpunished. + 6 Grandsons * are a crown to the aged, And fathers * are the glory of their sons. * 7 Upright * speech does not befit a fool. + How much less does false speech befit a ruler! * + 8 A gift is like a precious stone * to its owner; + Everywhere he turns, it brings him success. + 9 Whoever forgives * a transgression seeks love, + But the one who keeps harping on a matter separates close friends. + 10 A rebuke makes a deeper impression on one having understanding + Than striking a stupid person a hundred times. + 11 A bad man seeks only rebellion, But a cruel messenger will be sent to punish him. + 12 Better to meet a bear bereaved of her cubs Than to encounter someone stupid in his foolishness. + 13 If anyone repays bad for good, Bad will not depart from his house. + 14 Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate; * Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave. + 15 Anyone who acquits the wicked one and anyone who condemns the righteous one + —Both of them are detestable to Jehovah. 16 What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdom When he has no heart for acquiring it? * + 17 A true friend shows love at all times + And is a brother who is born for times of distress. + 18 A man lacking good sense * shakes hands and agrees To put up security * in the presence of his neighbor. + 19 The one who loves conflict loves transgression. + Anyone who makes his entryway high invites a crash. + 20 The one who is crooked at heart will not find success, * + And the one who speaks deceitfully will fall into ruin. 21 The one who fathers a stupid child will experience grief; And the father of a senseless child has no joy. + 22 A joyful heart is good medicine, * + But a crushed spirit saps one’s strength. * + 23 A wicked man will take a bribe in secret * To pervert the course of justice. + 24 Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person, But the eyes of the stupid wander to the ends of the earth. + 25 A stupid son brings grief to his father And heartache * to the one who gave birth to him. + 26 To punish * the righteous one is not good, And to flog honorable people goes against what is right. 27 A man of knowledge restrains his words, + And a discerning man will remain calm. * + 28 Even a fool who keeps silent will be considered wise, And the one who seals his lips, discerning.
