Proverbs 15:1-33 15 A mild * answer turns away rage, + But a harsh * word stirs up anger. + 2 The tongue of the wise makes good use of knowledge, + But the mouth of the stupid blurts out foolishness. 3 The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere, Watching both the bad and the good. + 4 A calm tongue * is a tree of life, + But twisted speech causes despair. * 5 A fool disrespects his father’s discipline, + But a shrewd person accepts correction. * + 6 In the house of the righteous one there is abundant treasure, But the produce * of the wicked one brings him trouble. + 7 The lips of the wise spread knowledge, + But not so the heart of the stupid one. + 8 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable to Jehovah, + But the prayer of the upright is a pleasure to Him. + 9 Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one, + But he loves the one who pursues righteousness. + 10 Discipline seems bad * to one forsaking the way, + But whoever hates reproof will die. + 11 The Grave * and the place of destruction * are in full view of Jehovah. + How much more so the hearts of men! + 12 The scoffer does not love the one correcting * him. + He will not consult the wise. + 13 A joyful heart makes for a cheerful countenance, But heartache crushes the spirit. + 14 The understanding heart seeks knowledge, + But the mouth of the stupid feeds on * foolishness. + 15 All the days of the afflicted one are bad, + But the one with a cheerful * heart has a continual feast. + 16 Better is a little in the fear of Jehovah + Than great wealth along with anxiety. * + 17 Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love + Than a fattened * bull where there is hatred. + 18 A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, + But one who is slow to anger calms a quarrel. + 19 The way of the lazy one is like a hedge of thorns, + But the path of the upright is like a level highway. + 20 A wise son makes his father rejoice, + But a stupid man despises his mother. + 21 Foolishness is a joy to one lacking good sense, * + But the man of discernment walks straight ahead. + 22 Plans fail when there is no consultation, * But there is accomplishment through many advisers. * + 23 A man rejoices in giving the right answer, * + And a word spoken at the right time—how good it is! + 24 The path of life leads upward to one with insight, + To turn him away from the Grave * below. + 25 Jehovah will tear down the house of the haughty, + But he will preserve the boundary of the widow. + 26 Jehovah detests the schemes of the wicked one, + But pleasant sayings are pure to Him. + 27 The one making dishonest profit brings trouble * on his own household, + But the one hating bribes will keep living. + 28 The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering, * + But the mouth of the wicked blurts out bad things. 29 Jehovah is far away from the wicked, But he hears the prayer of the righteous. + 30 Bright eyes make * the heart rejoice; A good report invigorates the bones. * + 31 The one who listens to life-giving reproof Is at home among the wise. + 32 Anyone refusing discipline despises his life, * + But whoever listens to reproof acquires understanding. * + 33 The fear of Jehovah is a training in wisdom, + And before glory there is humility. + Footnotes ^ Or “gentle.” ^ Or “painful.” ^ Or “A tongue of healing.” ^ Lit., “the crushing of the spirit.” ^ Or “reproof.” ^ Or “income.” ^ Or “severe.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
