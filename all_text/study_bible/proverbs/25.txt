Proverbs 25:1-28 25 These also are the proverbs of Solʹo·mon, + which the men of Hez·e·kiʹah + the king of Judah transcribed: * 2 It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret, + And the glory of kings is to search through a matter. 3 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, So the heart of kings is unsearchable. 4 Remove the dross from the silver, And it will emerge completely refined. + 5 Remove the wicked one from the king’s presence, And his throne will be firmly established in righteousness. + 6 Do not honor yourself before the king, + And do not take a place among the prominent, + 7 For it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here,” Than to humiliate you in the presence of a noble. + 8 Do not rush into a legal dispute, For what will you do later if your neighbor humiliates you? + 9 Plead your case with your neighbor, + But do not reveal what you were told confidentially, * + 10 So that the one listening will not put you to shame And you spread a bad report * that cannot be recalled. 11 Like apples of gold in silver carvings * Is a word spoken at the right time. + 12 Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold Is a wise reprover to the receptive ear. + 13 Just like the coldness of snow on the day of harvest Is a faithful messenger to those who sent him, For he refreshes his master. * + 14 Like clouds and wind that bring no rain Is a man who boasts about a gift never given. * + 15 By patience a commander is won over, And a gentle * tongue can break a bone. + 16 If you find honey, eat only what you need, For if you take too much, you may vomit it up. + 17 Rarely set foot in your neighbor’s house, So that he does not get tired of you and hate you. 18 Like a war club and a sword and a sharp arrow Is a man bearing false witness against his neighbor. + 19 Like a broken tooth or an unsteady foot Is confidence in an unreliable * person in times of trouble. 20 Like one who removes a garment on a cold day And like vinegar poured on soda * Is the one who sings songs to a gloomy heart. + 21 If your enemy * is hungry, give him bread to eat; If he is thirsty, give him water to drink, + 22 For you will be heaping burning coals on his head, * + And Jehovah will reward you. 23 The north wind brings a downpour, And a gossiping tongue brings an angry face. + 24 Better to dwell on a corner of the roof Than in the same house with a quarrelsome * wife. + 25 Like cold water on a tired soul * Is a good report from a distant land. + 26 Like a muddied spring and a ruined well Is a righteous person who gives in to * a wicked one. 27 It is not good to eat too much honey, + Nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory. + 28 As a city broken through, without a wall, Is the man who cannot control his temper. * + Footnotes ^ Or “copied and compiled.” ^ Or “the secrets of others.” ^ Or “a malicious rumor.” ^ Or “settings.” ^ Or “the soul of his master.” ^ Lit., “a gift of falsehood.” ^ Or “mild.” ^ Or possibly, “a treacherous.” ^ Or “alkali.” ^ Lit., “the one hating you.” ^ That is, to soften the person and melt his hardness. ^ Or “nagging.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “compromises with.” Lit., “staggers before.” ^ Or “who has no restraint for his spirit.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
