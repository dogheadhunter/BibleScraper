Proverbs 18:1-24 18 Whoever isolates himself pursues his own selfish desires; He rejects * all practical wisdom. 2 A stupid person takes no pleasure in understanding; He would rather disclose what is in his heart. + 3 When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes, And along with dishonor there is disgrace. + 4 The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters. + The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 5 It is not good to show partiality to the wicked one + Or to deprive the righteous one of justice. + 6 The speech of the stupid one leads to quarrels, + And his mouth invites a beating. + 7 The mouth of the stupid is his ruin, + And his lips are a snare for his life. * 8 The words of a slanderer are like tasty morsels; * + They are gulped right down into the stomach. + 9 Whoever is lazy in his work Is a brother to the one who causes ruin. + 10 The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. + Into it the righteous one runs and receives protection. * + 11 The wealth of the rich is his fortified city; It is like a protective wall in his imagination. + 12 Before a crash a man’s heart is lofty, + And before glory there is humility. + 13 When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, It is foolish and humiliating. + 14 A person’s spirit can sustain him through illness, + But who can bear a crushed spirit? * + 15 The heart of the understanding one acquires knowledge, + And the ear of the wise seeks to find knowledge. 16 A man’s gift opens the way for him; + It gives him access to great people. 17 The first to state his case seems right, + Until the other party comes and cross-examines him. * + 18 Casting lots puts an end to disputes + And decides between * strong opponents. 19 A brother offended is more unyielding than a fortified city, + And there are disputes like the bars of a fortress. + 20 From the fruitage of a man’s speech * his stomach will be filled; + He will be satisfied with what his lips produce. 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; + Those who love to use it will eat its fruitage. + 22 The one who finds a good wife has found something good, + And he receives Jehovah’s favor. * + 23 The poor man implores when speaking, But the rich man answers harshly. 24 There are companions ready to crush one another, + But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. + Footnotes ^ Or “shows contempt for.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “like things to be swallowed greedily.” ^ Lit., “is raised high,” that is, out of reach, safe. ^ Or “complete despair?” ^ Or “searches him through.” ^ Lit., “separates.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ Or “goodwill.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
