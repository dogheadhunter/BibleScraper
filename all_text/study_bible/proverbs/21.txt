Proverbs 21:1-31 21 A king’s heart is like streams of water in Jehovah’s hand. + He directs it wherever He pleases. + 2 All of a man’s ways seem right to him, + But Jehovah examines the hearts. * + 3 To do what is right and just Is more pleasing to Jehovah than a sacrifice. + 4 Haughty eyes and an arrogant heart —The lamp that guides the wicked is sin. + 5 The plans of the diligent surely lead to success, * + But all who are hasty surely head for poverty. + 6 Gaining treasures by a lying tongue Is like a vanishing mist, a deadly snare. * + 7 The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, + For they refuse to act with justice. 8 The way of a guilty man is crooked, But the activity of the pure man is upright. + 9 Better to dwell on a corner of the roof Than in the same house with a quarrelsome * wife. + 10 The wicked man * craves what is bad; + He shows no favor toward his neighbor. + 11 When a ridiculer is punished, the inexperienced become wiser, And when a wise person receives insight, he gains knowledge. * + 12 The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked one; He overthrows the wicked to their ruin. + 13 Whoever stops up his ear to the cry of the lowly one Will himself call and not be answered. + 14 A secret gift subdues anger, + And a hidden bribe, * fierce rage. 15 It is a joy for the righteous one to act with justice, + But it is something terrible to those who practice evil. 16 The man who strays from the way of insight Will rest in the company of those powerless in death. + 17 The one who loves having a good time * will come to poverty; + The one who loves wine and oil will not grow rich. 18 The wicked one is a ransom for the righteous one, And the treacherous one will be taken in place of the upright. + 19 Better to dwell in the wilderness Than with a quarrelsome * and irritable wife. + 20 Precious treasure and oil are found in the house of the wise, + But the stupid man will squander * what he has. + 21 Whoever pursues righteousness and loyal love Will find life, righteousness, and glory. + 22 A wise man can scale * the city of the mighty And undermine the strength in which they trust. + 23 The one guarding his mouth and his tongue Keeps himself * out of trouble. + 24 A presumptuous, arrogant braggart is what you call The man who acts with reckless presumptuousness. + 25 What the lazy man craves will put him to death, For his hands refuse to work. + 26 All day long he greedily craves, But the righteous one gives, holding nothing back. + 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable. + How much more when he offers it with evil intent! * 28 A lying witness will perish, + But the man who listens will testify with success. * 29 The wicked man puts on a bold face, + But it is the upright one whose course is sure. * + 30 There is no wisdom, nor discernment, nor counsel in opposition to Jehovah. + 31 The horse is prepared for the day of battle, + But salvation belongs to Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “motives.” ^ Or “advantage.” ^ Or possibly, “for those seeking death.” ^ Or “nagging.” ^ Or “The soul of the wicked one.” ^ Or “he knows what to do.” ^ Lit., “a bribe in the bosom.” ^ Or “loves pleasure.” ^ Or “nagging.” ^ Lit., “swallow.” ^ Or “prevail over.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Or “along with shameful conduct!” ^ Lit., “speak forever.” ^ Or “who makes his way sure.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
