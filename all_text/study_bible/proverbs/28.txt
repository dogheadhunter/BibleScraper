Proverbs 28:1-28 28 The wicked flee when no one pursues them, But the righteous are as confident as a lion. * + 2 When there is transgression * in the land, it will have one prince after another, + But with the help of a man of discernment and knowledge, a prince * will long endure. + 3 A poor man who defrauds the lowly + Is like a rain that sweeps away all the food. 4 Those who abandon the law praise the wicked one, But those who observe the law are indignant with them. + 5 Evil men cannot understand justice, But those who seek Jehovah can understand everything. + 6 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity Than a rich man whose ways are corrupt. + 7 An understanding son observes the law, But a companion of gluttons disgraces his father. + 8 The one who increases his wealth by interest + and usury Amasses it for the one who shows favor to the poor. + 9 The one refusing to listen to the law —Even his prayer is detestable. + 10 The one misleading the upright into an evil course will fall into his own pit, + But the blameless will inherit what is good. + 11 A rich man is wise in his own eyes, + But a poor man with discernment can see through him. + 12 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, But when the wicked rise to power, people go into hiding. + 13 The one covering over his transgressions will not succeed, + But whoever confesses and abandons them will be shown mercy. + 14 Happy is the man who is always on guard, * But whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity. + 15 Like a growling lion and a charging bear Is a wicked ruler over a helpless people. + 16 A leader without discernment abuses his power, + But the one hating dishonest profit will prolong his life. + 17 A man burdened with bloodguilt for taking someone’s life * will keep fleeing until the grave. * + Let no one support him. 18 The one walking faultlessly will be saved, + But the one whose ways are crooked will suddenly fall. + 19 The one cultivating his ground will have plenty of bread, But the one taking up worthless pursuits will have his fill of poverty. + 20 A faithful man will receive many blessings, + But the one hastening to get rich will not remain innocent. + 21 It is not good to show partiality; + But a man might do wrong for a piece of bread. 22 An envious * man is eager for wealth, Not knowing that poverty will overtake him. 23 Whoever reproves a man + will afterward find more favor + Than someone who flatters with his tongue. 24 Whoever robs his father and mother and says, “It is not wrong,” + Is a partner of the man who causes ruin. + 25 The greedy person * stirs up dissension, But whoever relies on Jehovah will prosper. * + 26 Whoever trusts in his own heart is stupid, + But the one who walks in wisdom will escape. + 27 Whoever gives to the poor will lack nothing, + But the one who closes his eyes to them will receive many curses. 28 When the wicked rise to power, a man hides himself, But when they perish, the righteous increase. + Footnotes ^ Or “a young lion.” ^ Or “revolt.” ^ Lit., “he.” ^ Or “who is never without fear.” ^ Or “with the blood of a soul.” ^ Or “pit.” ^ Or “greedy.” ^ Or possibly, “The arrogant soul.” ^ Lit., “will be made fat.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
