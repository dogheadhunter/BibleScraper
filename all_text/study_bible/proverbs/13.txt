Proverbs 13:1-25 13 A wise son accepts his father’s discipline, + But the scoffer does not listen to a rebuke. * + 2 From the fruitage of his speech * a man will eat what is good, + But the very desire * of the treacherous is for violence. 3 The one guarding his mouth * protects his life, * + But the one opening his lips wide will come to ruin. + 4 The lazy person has his cravings, yet he * has nothing, + But the diligent one * will be fully satisfied. * + 5 The righteous one hates lies, + But the actions of the wicked bring shame and disgrace. 6 Righteousness protects the one whose way is innocent, + But wickedness brings down the sinner. 7 There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing; + There is another who pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. 8 Riches are the ransom for a man’s life, * + But the poor are not even threatened. * + 9 The light of the righteous shines brightly, * + But the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished. + 10 Presumptuousness leads only to strife, + But wisdom belongs to those who seek advice. * + 11 Wealth quickly gained * will dwindle, + But the wealth of the one who gathers it little by little * will increase. 12 Expectation * postponed makes the heart sick, + But a desire realized is a tree of life. + 13 Whoever despises instruction * will pay the penalty, + But the one who respects the commandment will be rewarded. + 14 The teaching * of the wise one is a source of life + To turn one away from the snares of death. 15 Keen insight wins favor, But the way of the treacherous is harsh. 16 The shrewd person acts with knowledge, + But the fool exposes his own foolishness. + 17 A wicked messenger falls into trouble, + But a faithful envoy brings healing. + 18 Whoever neglects discipline comes to poverty and disgrace, But the one accepting correction * will be glorified. + 19 Desire when realized is sweet to a person, * + But the stupid hate to turn away from bad. + 20 The one walking with the wise will become wise, + But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly. + 21 Calamity pursues sinners, + But prosperity rewards the righteous. + 22 The good person leaves an inheritance to his grandchildren, But the sinner’s wealth will be stored up for the righteous one. + 23 The plowed field of the poor yields much food, But it * may be swept away by injustice. 24 Whoever holds back his rod * hates his son, + But the one who loves him disciplines him diligently. * + 25 The righteous one eats and satisfies his appetite, * + But the stomach of the wicked is empty. + Footnotes ^ Or “correction.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “what he says.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “will be made fat.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “hear no rebuke.” ^ Lit., “rejoices.” ^ Or “those consulting together.” ^ Lit., “gathers by hand.” ^ Or “Wealth from vanity.” ^ Or “Hope.” ^ Or “the word.” ^ Or “law.” ^ Or “reproof.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “he.” ^ Or “discipline; punishment.” ^ Or possibly, “promptly.” ^ Or “soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
