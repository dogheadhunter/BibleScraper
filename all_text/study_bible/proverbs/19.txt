Proverbs 19:1-29 19 It is better to be poor and walk in integrity + Than to be stupid and speak lies. + 2 A person * without knowledge is not good, + And the one who acts rashly * is sinning. 3 It is a man’s own foolishness that distorts his way, And his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah. 4 Wealth attracts many friends, But the poor man will be deserted even by his friend. + 5 A false witness will not go unpunished, + And the one who lies with every breath will not escape. + 6 Many seek the favor of a noble, * And everyone is a friend to the man who gives gifts. 7 All the brothers of a poor man hate him; + How much more he is shunned by his friends! + He pursues them with requests, but no one responds. 8 Whoever acquires good sense * loves himself. * + Whoever treasures discernment will find success. * + 9 A false witness will not go unpunished, And the one who lies with every breath will perish. + 10 It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury; How much less for a servant to rule over princes! + 11 The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, + And it is beauty on his part to overlook * an offense. * + 12 The king’s rage is like the growling of a lion, * + But his favor is like dew on the vegetation. 13 A stupid son brings adversity on his father, + And a quarrelsome * wife is like a roof that never stops leaking. + 14 A house and wealth are inherited from fathers, But a discreet wife is from Jehovah. + 15 Laziness brings on a deep sleep, And a sluggish person * will go hungry. + 16 The one who keeps the commandment keeps his life; * + The one who is reckless about his ways will die. + 17 The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah, + And He will repay * him for what he does. + 18 Discipline your son while there is hope, + And do not become responsible for * his death. + 19 The hot-tempered man will pay the penalty; If you try to spare him, you will have to do it again and again. + 20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline, + In order to become wise in your future. + 21 Many are the plans in a man’s heart, But the counsel * of Jehovah is what will prevail. + 22 The desirable thing in a man is his loyal love; + And it is better to be poor than to be a liar. 23 The fear of Jehovah leads to life; + The one who has it will have a pleasant rest, free from harm. + 24 The lazy one buries his hand in the banquet bowl, But he does not even bother to bring it back to his mouth. + 25 Strike the ridiculer, + so that the inexperienced one may become shrewd, + And reprove the understanding one, so that he will increase in knowledge. + 26 The one who mistreats his father and drives away his mother Is a son causing shame and disgrace. + 27 My son, if you stop listening to discipline, You will stray from the sayings of knowledge. 28 A worthless witness mocks justice, + And the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil. + 29 Judgment is in store for ridiculers, + And beatings for the back of the stupid ones. + Footnotes ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “hastens with his feet.” ^ Or “generous man.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Lit., “good.” ^ Lit., “acquires heart.” ^ Lit., “pass over.” ^ Or “a transgression.” ^ Or “a maned young lion.” ^ Or “nagging.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “reward.” ^ Or “desire.” Lit., “raise your soul to.” ^ Or “purpose.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
