Proverbs 3:1-35 3 My son, do not forget my teaching, * And may your heart observe my commandments, 2 Because they will add many days And years of life and peace to you. + 3 Do not let loyal love and faithfulness * leave you. + Tie them around your neck; Write them on the tablet of your heart; + 4 Then you will find favor and good insight In the eyes of God and man. + 5 Trust in Jehovah + with all your heart, And do not rely * on your own understanding. + 6 In all your ways take notice of him, + And he will make your paths straight. + 7 Do not become wise in your own eyes. + Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad. 8 It will be a healing to your body * And refreshment for your bones. 9 Honor Jehovah with your valuable things, + With the firstfruits * of all your produce; * + 10 Then your storehouses will be completely filled, + And your vats * will overflow with new wine. 11 My son, do not reject the discipline of Jehovah, + And do not loathe his reproof, + 12 For those whom Jehovah loves he reproves, + Just as a father does a son in whom he delights. + 13 Happy is the man who finds wisdom + And the man who acquires discernment; 14 To gain it is better than gaining silver, And having it as profit is better than having gold. + 15 It is more precious than corals; * Nothing you desire can compare to it. 16 Long life is in its right hand; Riches and glory are in its left hand. 17 Its ways are pleasant, And all its paths are peaceful. + 18 It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it, And those who keep firm hold of it will be called happy. + 19 Jehovah founded the earth in wisdom. + He solidly established the heavens in discernment. + 20 By his knowledge the watery deeps were split apart And the cloudy skies dripped with dew. + 21 My son, do not lose sight of them. * Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability; 22 They will give you * life And be an adornment for your neck; 23 Then you will walk on your way in safety, And your foot will never stumble. * + 24 When you lie down, you will have no fear; + You will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant. + 25 You will not fear any sudden terror + Nor the storm that is coming on the wicked. + 26 For Jehovah will prove to be your source of confidence; + He will keep your foot from being caught. + 27 Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it * + If it is within your power * to help. + 28 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go away; come back later! I will give it to you tomorrow,” If you can give it now. 29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor + When he lives in a sense of security with you. 30 Do not quarrel with a man for no reason + If he has done nothing bad to you. + 31 Do not envy the violent man + Nor choose any of his ways, 32 For Jehovah detests a devious person, + But His close friendship is with the upright. + 33 The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one, + But he blesses the home of the righteous. + 34 For he mocks those who ridicule, + But he shows favor to the meek. + 35 The wise will inherit honor, But the stupid ones glorify dishonor. + Footnotes ^ Or “law.” ^ Or “truth.” ^ Lit., “lean.” ^ Lit., “navel.” ^ Or “income.” ^ Or “very best.” ^ Or “winepresses.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Evidently referring to God’s qualities mentioned in the previous verses. ^ Or “your soul.” ^ Or “strike against anything.” ^ Or “within the power of your hand.” ^ Or “to whom it is owing.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
