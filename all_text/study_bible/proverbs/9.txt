Proverbs 9:1-18 9 True wisdom has built its house; It has carved * out its seven pillars. 2 It has fully prepared its meat; * It has mixed its wine; It has also arranged its table. 3 It has sent out its female servants To call out from the heights above the city: + 4 “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.” She says to the one lacking good sense: * 5 “Come, eat my bread And share in drinking the wine that I have mixed. 6 Leave behind your inexperience * and live; + Walk forward in the way of understanding.” + 7 The one who corrects a ridiculer invites dishonor, + And whoever reproves someone wicked will get hurt. 8 Do not reprove a ridiculer, or he will hate you. + Reprove a wise person, and he will love you. + 9 Share with a wise person, and he will become wiser. + Teach someone righteous, and he will add to his learning. 10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, + And knowledge of the Most Holy One + is understanding. 11 For by me your days will be many, + And years will be added to your life. 12 If you become wise, you are wise to your own advantage, But if you are a ridiculer, you alone will bear it. 13 A stupid woman is loud. + She is ignorant and knows absolutely nothing. 14 She sits at the entrance of her house On a seat in the high places of the city, + 15 Calling out to those passing by, To those walking straight ahead on their way: 16 “Whoever is inexperienced, let him come in here.” She says to those lacking good sense: * + 17 “Stolen waters are sweet, And food eaten in secret is pleasant.” + 18 But he does not know that those powerless in death are there, That her guests are in the depths of the Grave. * + Footnotes ^ Or “hewed.” ^ Lit., “She has slaughtered her slaughtering.” ^ Lit., “in want of heart.” ^ Or “the inexperienced ones.” ^ Lit., “in want of heart.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
