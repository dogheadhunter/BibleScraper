Proverbs 24:1-34 24 Do not envy evil men, And do not crave their company, + 2 For their heart meditates on violence, And their lips speak of trouble. 3 By wisdom a house * is built up, + And by discernment it is made secure. 4 By knowledge its rooms are filled With all sorts of precious and pleasant treasures. + 5 A wise man is powerful, + And with knowledge a man increases his power. 6 By skillful direction * you will wage your war, + And through many advisers * there is victory. * + 7 True wisdom is unattainable for a fool; + He has nothing to say in the city gate. 8 Anyone who plots evil Will be called a master schemer. + 9 Foolish schemes * are sinful, And people detest a ridiculer. + 10 If you become discouraged in the day of distress, * Your strength will be meager. 11 Rescue those who are being taken away to death, And hold back those staggering to the slaughter. + 12 If you say, “But we did not know about this,” Does not the One who examines hearts * discern it? + Yes, the One who watches you * will know And will repay each man according to his activity. + 13 My son, eat honey, because it is good; Honey from the comb is sweet to the taste. 14 Likewise, know that wisdom is good for you. * + If you find it, you will have a future And your hope will not be cut off. + 15 Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one; Do not destroy his place of rest. 16 For the righteous one may fall seven times, and he will get up again, + But the wicked will be made to stumble by calamity. + 17 When your enemy falls, do not rejoice, And when he stumbles, do not let your heart be joyful; + 18 Otherwise, Jehovah will see and be displeased, And He will turn away his anger from him. * + 19 Do not be upset * because of evil men; Do not envy wicked people, 20 For there is no future for anyone evil; + The lamp of the wicked will be extinguished. + 21 My son, fear Jehovah and the king. + And do not associate with dissenters, * + 22 For their disaster will arise suddenly. + Who knows what ruin both * will bring upon them? + 23 These sayings also belong to the wise: Partiality in judgment is not good. + 24 Whoever says to the wicked one, “You are righteous,” + Will be cursed by the peoples and denounced by the nations. 25 But it will go well for those reproving him; + Blessings of good things will come upon them. + 26 People will kiss the lips of the one replying honestly. * + 27 Prepare your outside work, and get everything ready in the field; Then build your house. * 28 Do not testify against your neighbor without grounds. + Do not use your lips to deceive others. + 29 Do not say: “I will do to him just as he has done to me; I will repay him for what he did.” * + 30 I passed by the field of the lazy one, + By the vineyard of the man lacking good sense. * 31 I saw that it was overgrown with weeds; The ground was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down. + 32 I observed this and took it to heart; I saw it and learned this lesson: * 33 A little sleep, a little slumbering, A little folding of the hands to rest, 34 And your poverty will come like a bandit, And your want like an armed man. + Footnotes ^ Or “household.” ^ Or “wise guidance.” ^ Or “counselors.” ^ Or “success; salvation.” ^ Or “The schemes of a fool.” ^ Or “in times of trouble.” ^ Or “motives.” ^ Or “your soul.” ^ Or “is sweet to your soul.” ^ That is, the enemy. ^ Or “show yourself heated up.” ^ Or “those who are for a change.” ^ That is, Jehovah and the king. ^ Or possibly, “Replying in a straight­forward way is like giving a kiss.” ^ Or “household.” ^ Or “I will get even with him.” ^ Lit., “in want of heart.” ^ Lit., “I took the discipline:” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
