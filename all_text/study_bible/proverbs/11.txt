Proverbs 11:1-31 11 Dishonest * scales are detestable to Jehovah, But an accurate weight * brings pleasure to him. + 2 When presumptuousness comes, dishonor will follow, + But wisdom is with the modest ones. + 3 The integrity of the upright is what guides them, + But the deviousness of the treacherous will destroy them. + 4 Wealth * will be of no benefit on the day of fury, + But righteousness is what will rescue from death. + 5 The righteousness of the blameless one makes his path straight, But the wicked one will fall because of his own wickedness. + 6 The righteousness of the upright will rescue them, + But the treacherous will be caught by their own desires. + 7 When a wicked man dies, his hope perishes; And expectations based on his power also perish. + 8 The righteous one is rescued from distress, And the wicked one takes his place. + 9 By his mouth the apostate * brings his neighbor to ruin, But by knowledge the righteous are rescued. + 10 The goodness of the righteous makes a city rejoice, And when the wicked perish, there is a joyful cry. + 11 Because of the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, + But the mouth of the wicked tears it down. + 12 Whoever is lacking good sense * shows contempt for * his neighbor, But the man of true discernment remains silent. + 13 A slanderer goes about revealing confidential talk, + But the trustworthy person * keeps a confidence. * 14 When there is no skillful direction, * the people fall, But there is success * through many advisers. * + 15 Whoever guarantees a loan * for a stranger is sure to fare badly, + But whoever avoids * shaking hands in a pledge will be secure. 16 A gracious * woman acquires glory, + But ruthless men seize riches. 17 A kind man * benefits himself, * + But the cruel person brings trouble * on himself. + 18 The wicked one earns deceptive wages, + But the one who sows righteousness receives a true reward. + 19 The one standing firmly for righteousness is in line for life, + But the one chasing after evil is in line for death. 20 Those crooked at heart are detestable to Jehovah, + But those whose way is blameless bring pleasure to him. + 21 Be assured of this: * An evil person will not go unpunished, + But the children of the righteous will escape. 22 Like a gold ring in the snout of a pig Is a beautiful woman who rejects good sense. 23 The desire of the righteous leads to good, + But what the wicked hope for leads to fury. 24 One gives generously * and ends up with more; + Another withholds what should be given, but he comes to poverty. + 25 The generous person * will prosper, * + And whoever refreshes * others will himself be refreshed. + 26 The people will curse the one who withholds grain, But they will bless the one who sells it. 27 The one who diligently seeks to do good seeks favor, + But the one searching for bad—that is what will surely come upon him. + 28 The one trusting in his riches will fall, + But the righteous will flourish like the foliage. + 29 Anyone who brings trouble * on his household will inherit the wind, + And the fool will be a servant to the wisehearted one. 30 The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life, + And the one who wins souls * is wise. + 31 If, indeed, the righteous one on earth is rewarded, How much more the wicked one and the sinner! + Footnotes ^ Or “a complete stone weight.” ^ Or “Cheating.” ^ Or “Valuable things.” ^ Or “godless man.” ^ Lit., “in want of heart.” ^ Or “despises.” ^ Lit., “the one faithful in spirit.” ^ Lit., “covers over a matter.” ^ Or “wise guidance.” ^ Or “salvation.” ^ Or “counselors.” ^ Lit., “hates.” ^ Or “puts up security.” ^ Or “charming.” ^ Or “A man of loyal love.” ^ Or “does good to his soul.” ^ Or “disgrace.” ^ Lit., “Hand to hand.” ^ Lit., “scatters.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “will be made fat.” ^ Lit., “freely waters.” ^ Or “disgrace.” ^ See Glossary .
