Proverbs 30:1-33 30 The weighty message contained in the words of Aʹgur son of Jaʹkeh, which he spoke to Ithʹi·el, to Ithʹi·el and Uʹcal. 2 I am more ignorant than anyone else, + And I lack the understanding a man should have. 3 I have not learned wisdom, And I do not possess the knowledge of the Most Holy One. 4 Who has ascended to heaven and then descended? + Who has gathered the wind in the palms of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in his garment? + Who has established * all the ends of the earth? + What is his name and the name of his son—if you know? 5 Every saying of God is refined. + He is a shield to those taking refuge in him. + 6 Add nothing to his words, + Or he will reprove you, And you will be proved a liar. 7 Two things I ask of you. Do not withhold them from me before I die. 8 Remove untruth and lies far from me. + Give me neither poverty nor riches. Just let me consume my portion of food, + 9 So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say, “Who is Jehovah?” + Nor let me become poor and steal and dishonor * the name of my God. 10 Do not slander a servant to his master, Or he may curse you and you will be found guilty. + 11 There is a generation that curses its father And does not bless its mother. + 12 There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes + But has not been cleansed from its filth. * 13 There is a generation whose eyes are so haughty And whose eyes look so arrogantly! + 14 There is a generation whose teeth are swords And whose jaws are slaughtering knives; They devour the lowly ones of the earth And the poor from among mankind. + 15 The leeches have two daughters that cry, “Give! Give!” There are three things that do not get satisfied, Four that never say, “Enough!” 16 —The Grave * + and a barren womb, A land that is deprived of water, And fire that never says, “Enough!” 17 The eye that mocks a father and despises obedience to a mother + —The ravens of the valley * will peck it out, And the young eagles will eat it up. + 18 There are three things that are beyond my comprehension, * And four that I do not understand: 19 The way of an eagle in the heavens, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the open sea, And the way of a man with a young woman. 20 This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats, she wipes her mouth; Then she says, “I have done nothing wrong.” + 21 There are three things that make the earth shudder And four things it cannot endure: 22 When a slave rules as king, + When a fool is glutted with food, 23 When a hated * woman is taken as a wife, And when a servant girl takes the place of * her mistress. + 24 Four things on earth are among the smallest, But they are instinctively wise: * + 25 The ants are not strong creatures, * Yet they prepare their food in the summer. + 26 The rock badgers * + are not mighty creatures, * Yet they make their house in the crags. + 27 The locusts + have no king, Yet they all go forward in formation. * + 28 The gecko lizard + clings with its feet, And it goes into the palace of a king. 29 There are three things that have an impressive stride, Four that are impressive as they move: 30 The lion, the mightiest among beasts, Which does not retreat from anyone; + 31 The greyhound; the male goat; And a king whose army is with him. 32 If you have foolishly exalted yourself + Or if you have schemed to do so, Put your hand over your mouth. + 33 For as the churning of milk produces butter And the squeezing of the nose produces blood, So the stirring up of anger produces quarrels. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “raised.” ^ Or “assail.” ^ Lit., “excrement.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
