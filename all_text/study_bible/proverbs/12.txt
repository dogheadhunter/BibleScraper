Proverbs 12:1-28 12 The one who loves discipline loves knowledge, + But the one who hates reproof is unreasoning. * + 2 The good person obtains Jehovah’s approval, But He condemns the man of wicked schemes. + 3 No man is made secure by wickedness, + But the righteous will never be uprooted. 4 A capable wife is a crown to her husband, + But the wife who acts shamefully is like rottenness in his bones. + 5 The thoughts of the righteous are just, But the guidance of the wicked is deceptive. 6 The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush, * + But the mouth of the upright saves them. + 7 When the wicked are overthrown, they are no more, But the house of the righteous will keep standing. + 8 A man is praised for the discretion of his mouth, + But one with a twisted heart will be treated with contempt. + 9 Better to be lightly esteemed and have a servant Than to glorify oneself and have no food. * + 10 The righteous one takes care of his domestic animals, * + But even the mercy of the wicked is cruel. 11 The one who cultivates his land will be satisfied with food, + But the one pursuing worthless things is lacking good sense. * 12 The wicked man envies what other evil men have caught, But the root of the righteous bears fruit. 13 The evil man is ensnared by his own sinful speech, + But the righteous one escapes from distress. 14 From the fruitage of his speech * a man is satisfied with good, + And the work of his hands will reward him. 15 The way of the fool is right in his own eyes, + But the wise one accepts advice. * + 16 A fool immediately * shows his annoyance, + But the shrewd man overlooks * an insult. 17 The one who testifies faithfully will tell the truth, * But a false witness speaks deceit. 18 Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword, But the tongue of the wise is a healing. + 19 Truthful lips will endure forever, + But a lying tongue will last for only a moment. + 20 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot mischief, But those who promote * peace have joy. + 21 No harm will befall the righteous one, + But the wicked will have their fill of calamity. + 22 Lying lips are detestable to Jehovah, + But those acting faithfully bring pleasure to him. 23 A shrewd man conceals what he knows, But the heart of the fool blurts out his foolishness. + 24 The hand of the diligent ones will rule, + But idle hands will be put to forced labor. + 25 Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, * + But a good word cheers it up. + 26 The righteous one searches out his pastures, But the course of the wicked leads them astray. 27 The lazy do not chase after the prey, + But diligence is a man’s precious treasure. 28 The path of righteousness leads to life; + Along its pathway there is no death.
