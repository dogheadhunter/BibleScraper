The Song of Solomon 3:1-11 3 “Upon my bed during the nights, I sought the one I love. * + I sought him, but I did not find him. + 2 I will arise and roam the city; In the streets and in the public squares, Let me seek the one I love. * I sought him, but I did not find him. 3 The watchmen making their rounds in the city found me. + ‘Have you seen the one I love?’ * 4 Scarcely had I passed by them When I found the one I love. * I held on to him, I would not let him go Until I brought him into my mother’s house, + Into the interior room of her who conceived me. 5 I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles and the does of the field: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.” + 6 “What is this coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, With all the fragrant powders of a merchant?” + 7 “Look! It is the couch belonging to Solʹo·mon. Sixty mighty men surround it, Of the mighty men of Israel, + 8 All of them armed with a sword, All trained in warfare, Each with his sword at his side To guard against the terrors of the night.” 9 “It is the royal litter * of King Solʹo·mon That he made for himself from the trees of Lebʹa·non. + 10 Its pillars he made of silver, Its supports of gold. Its seat is of purple wool; Its interior was lovingly decorated By the daughters of Jerusalem.” 11 “Go out, O daughters of Zion, Gaze at King Solʹo·mon Wearing the wedding crown * his mother + made for him On the day of his marriage, On the day of his heart’s rejoicing.” Footnotes ^ Or “my soul loves.” ^ Or “my soul loves.” ^ Or “my soul loves.” ^ Or “my soul loves.” ^ A covered couch used to carry a person of importance. ^ Or “the wreath; the garland.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
