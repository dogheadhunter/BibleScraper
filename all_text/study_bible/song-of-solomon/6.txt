The Song of Solomon 6:1-13 6 “Where has your dear one gone, O most beautiful of women? Which way did your dear one turn? Let us seek him with you.” 2 “My dear one has gone down to his garden, To the beds of spice plants, To shepherd among the gardens And to pick lilies. + 3 I am my dear one’s, And my dear one is mine. + He is shepherding among the lilies.” + 4 “You are as beautiful as Tirʹzah, * + my beloved, + As lovely as Jerusalem, + As breathtaking as armies around their banners. + 5 Turn your eyes + away from me, For they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats Streaming down the slopes of Gilʹe·ad. + 6 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep That have come up from being washed, All of them bearing twins, And not one has lost her young. 7 Like a segment of pomegranate Are your cheeks * behind your veil. 8 There may be 60 queens And 80 concubines And young women without number. + 9 But only one is my dove, + my flawless one. The only one of her mother. She is the favorite * of the one who bore her. The daughters see her, and they pronounce her happy; Queens and concubines, and they praise her. 10 ‘Who is she who shines * like the dawn, As beautiful as the full moon, As pure as the sunlight, As breathtaking as armies around their banners?’” + 11 “I went down to the garden of nut trees + To see the new growth in the valley, * To see whether the vine had sprouted, * Whether the pomegranate trees had blossomed. 12 Before I knew it, My desire * had put me At the chariots of my noble * people.” 13 “Return, return, O Shuʹlam·mite! Return, return, That we may look upon you!” “Why do you gaze upon the Shuʹlam·mite?” + “She is like the dance of two companies!” * Footnotes ^ Or “Pleasant City.” ^ Or “temples.” ^ Lit., “the pure one.” ^ Lit., “looks down.” ^ Or “wadi.” ^ Or “budded.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “willing.” ^ Or “dance of Mahanaim.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
