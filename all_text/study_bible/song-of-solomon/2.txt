The Song of Solomon 2:1-17 2 “I am but a saffron * of the coastal plain, A lily of the valleys.” + 2 “Like a lily among thorns Is my beloved among the daughters.” 3 “Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my dear one among the sons. I passionately desire to sit in his shade, And his fruit is sweet to my taste. 4 He brought me into the banquet house, * And his banner over me was love. 5 Refresh me with raisin cakes; + Sustain me with apples, For I am lovesick. 6 His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me. + 7 I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles + and the does of the field: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined. + 8 The sound of my dear one! Look! Here he comes, Climbing the mountains, leaping over the hills. 9 My dear one is like a gazelle, like a young stag. + There he is, standing behind our wall, Gazing through the windows, Looking through the lattices. 10 My dear one speaks, he says to me: ‘Rise up, my beloved, My beautiful one, come away with me. 11 Look! The winter * has passed. The rains are over and gone. 12 Blossoms have appeared in the land, + The time of pruning has arrived, + And the song of the turtledove is heard in our land. + 13 The fig tree ripens its early figs; + The vines are in blossom and give off their fragrance. Rise up, my beloved, and come. My beautiful one, come away with me. 14 O my dove, in the retreats of the crag, + In the recesses of the cliff, Let me see you and hear your voice, + For your voice is pleasant and your appearance is lovely.’” + 15 “Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that ruin the vineyards, For our vineyards are in bloom.” 16 “My dear one is mine and I am his. + He is shepherding + among the lilies. + 17 Until the day grows breezy * and the shadows flee, Return quickly, O my dear one, Like the gazelle + or the young stag + upon the mountains of separation. * Footnotes ^ Or “crocus.” ^ Lit., “the house of wine.” ^ Or “rainy season.” ^ Lit., “the day breathes.” ^ Or possibly, “the cleft mountains.” Or “the mountains of Bether.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
