The Second of John 1:1-13 1 The older man * to the chosen lady and to her children, whom I truly love, and not only I but also all those who have come to know the truth, 2 because of the truth that remains in us and will be with us forever. 3 There will be with us undeserved kindness, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, with truth and love. 4 I rejoice very much because I have found some of your children walking in the truth, + just as we received commandment from the Father. 5 So now I request you, lady, that we love one another. (I am writing you, not a new commandment, but one that we had from the beginning.) + 6 And this is what love means, that we go on walking according to his commandments. + This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should go on walking in it. 7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, + those not acknowledging Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. + This is the deceiver and the antichrist. + 8 Look out for yourselves, so that you do not lose the things we have worked to produce, but that you may obtain a full reward. + 9 Everyone who pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. + The one who does remain in this teaching is the one who has both the Father and the Son. + 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your homes + or say a greeting to him. 11 For the one who says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works. 12 Although I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink, but I am hoping to come to you and to speak with you face-to-face, so that your joy may be in full measure. 13 The children of your sister, the chosen one, send you their greetings.
