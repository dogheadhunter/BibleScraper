Micah 3:1-12 3 I said: “Hear, please, you heads of Jacob And you commanders of the house of Israel. + Should you not know what is just? 2 But you hate what is good + and love what is bad; + You tear off the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones. + 3 You also eat the flesh of my people + And strip off their skin, Smashing their bones, crushing them to pieces, + Like what is cooked in a pot, * like meat in a cooking pot. 4 At that time they will call to Jehovah for help, But he will not answer them. He will hide his face from them at that time, + Because of their wicked deeds. + 5 This is what Jehovah says against the prophets who are leading my people astray, + Who proclaim ‘Peace!’ + while they bite * with their teeth + But who declare * war against him who puts nothing into their mouths: 6 ‘You will have night; + there will be no vision; + There will only be darkness for you, no divination. The sun will set on the prophets, And the day will turn dark for them. + 7 The visionaries will be put to shame, + And the diviners will be disappointed. All of them will have to cover over the mustache, * For there is no answer from God.’” 8 As for me, I am filled with power by the spirit of Jehovah, And with justice and might, To tell to Jacob his revolt and to Israel his sin. 9 Hear this, please, you heads of the house of Jacob And you commanders of the house of Israel, + Who detest justice and who make crooked all that is straight, + 10 Who build Zion with bloodshed and Jerusalem with unrighteousness. + 11 Her leaders * judge for a bribe, + Her priests instruct for a price, + And her prophets practice divination for money. * + And yet they lean on Jehovah, * saying: “Is not Jehovah with us? + No calamity will come upon us.” + 12 So because of you, Zion will be plowed up as a field, Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins, + And the mountain of the House * will become like high places in a forest. * + Footnotes ^ Or “wide-mouthed cooking pot.” ^ Or possibly, “when they have something to chew.” ^ Lit., “sanctify.” ^ Or “cover their mouths.” ^ Or “they claim to lean on Jehovah.” ^ Or “silver.” ^ Lit., “heads.” ^ Or “the temple mount.” ^ Or “like a wooded ridge.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
