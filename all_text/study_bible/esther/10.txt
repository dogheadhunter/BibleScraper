Esther 10:1-3 10 King A·has·u·eʹrus imposed forced labor on the land and the islands of the sea. 2 And all his powerful and mighty accomplishments, as well as the detailed account of Morʹde·cai’s + greatness to which the king exalted him, + are they not written in the book of the history of the times + of the kings of Meʹdi·a and Persia? + 3 For Morʹde·cai the Jew was second only to King A·has·u·eʹrus. He was great * among the Jews and respected by the multitude of his brothers, working for the good of his people and advocating the welfare of * all their descendants.
