Jeremiah 24:1-10 24 Then Jehovah showed me two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah, after King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar * of Babylon had carried into exile Jec·o·niʹah * + son of Je·hoiʹa·kim, + the king of Judah, along with the princes of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metalworkers; * he took them from Jerusalem to Babylon. + 2 One basket had very good figs, like early figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. 3 Jehovah then asked me: “What do you see, Jeremiah?” So I said: “Figs; the good figs are very good, but the bad ones are very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.” + 4 Then the word of Jehovah came to me, saying: 5 “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard in a good way the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chal·deʹans. 6 I will keep my eye on them for their good, and I will cause them to return to this land. + I will build them up, and I will not tear down; I will plant them, and I will not uproot. + 7 And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah. + They will become my people, and I will become their God, + for they will return to me with all their heart. + 8 “‘But concerning the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, + this is what Jehovah says: “So I will regard King Zed·e·kiʹah + of Judah, his princes, the remnant of Jerusalem who are left in this land, and those who are dwelling in the land of Egypt. + 9 I will make them an object of horror and calamity to all the kingdoms of the earth, + a reproach, a proverbial saying, a cause for ridicule, and a curse + in all the places to which I disperse them. + 10 And I will send against them the sword, + the famine, and the pestilence, * + until they have perished from the land that I gave to them and to their forefathers.”’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “Nebuchadrezzar,” a variant spelling. ^ Also called Jehoiachin and Coniah. ^ Or possibly, “builders of bulwarks.” ^ Or “disease.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
