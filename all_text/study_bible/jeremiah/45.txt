Jeremiah 45:1-5 45 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Barʹuch + the son of Ne·riʹah when he wrote in a book these words dictated by Jeremiah + in the fourth year of Je·hoiʹa·kim + son of Jo·siʹah, the king of Judah: 2 “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says concerning you, Barʹuch, 3 ‘You have said: “Woe to me, for Jehovah has added grief to my pain! I am weary from my groaning, and I have found no resting-place.”’ 4 “You should say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting—the entire land. + 5 But you are seeking * great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.”’ “‘For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,’ * + declares Jehovah, ‘and wherever you may go, I will grant you your life * as a spoil.’” * + Footnotes ^ Or “expecting.” ^ Or “people.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “will let you escape with your life.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
