Jeremiah 6:1-30 6 Take shelter, O sons of Benjamin, away from Jerusalem. Blow the horn + in Te·koʹa; + Light a fire signal over Beth-hac·cheʹrem! For a calamity looms from the north, a great disaster. + 2 The daughter of Zion resembles a beautiful and delicate woman. + 3 The shepherds and their droves will come. They will pitch their tents all around her, + Each grazing the flock in his care. + 4 “Prepare for * war against her! Rise up, and let us attack her at midday!” “Woe to us, for the day is declining, For the shadows of evening are getting longer!” 5 “Rise up, and let us attack during the night And destroy her fortified towers.” + 6 For this is what Jehovah of armies says: “Cut down wood and raise up a siege rampart against Jerusalem. + She is the city that must be held to account; There is nothing but oppression within her. + 7 As a cistern keeps its water cool, * So she keeps her wickedness cool. * Violence and destruction are heard in her; + Sickness and plague are constantly before me. 8 Be warned, O Jerusalem, or I * will turn away from you in disgust; + I will make you desolate, a land without inhabitants.” + 9 This is what Jehovah of armies says: “They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as the last grapes on a vine. Pass your hand again like one gathering grapes from the vines.” 10 “To whom should I speak and give warning? Who will listen? Look! Their ears are closed, * so that they are unable to pay attention. + Look! The word of Jehovah has become something they scorn; + They find no pleasure in it. 11 So I am filled with the wrath of Jehovah, And I am tired of holding it in.” + “Pour it out on the child in the street, + On the groups of young men gathered together. They will all be captured, a man along with his wife, The old men along with the very old. * + 12 Their houses will be turned over to others, Together with their fields and their wives. + For I will stretch my hand out against the inhabitants of the land,” declares Jehovah. 13 “For from the least to the greatest, each one is making dishonest gain; + From the prophet to the priest, each one is practicing fraud. + 14 And they try to heal the breakdown * of my people lightly, * saying, ‘There is peace! There is peace!’ When there is no peace. + 15 Do they feel ashamed of the detestable things they have done? They feel no shame at all! They do not even know how to feel humiliated! + So they will fall among the fallen. When I bring punishment on them they will stumble,” says Jehovah. 16 This is what Jehovah says: “Stand at the crossroads and see. Ask about the ancient roadways, Ask where the good way is, and walk in it, + And find rest for yourselves.” * But they say: “We will not walk in it.” + 17 “And I appointed watchmen + who said, ‘Pay attention to the sound of the horn!’” + But they said: “We will not pay attention.” + 18 “Therefore hear, O nations! And know, O assembly, What will happen to them. 19 Listen, O earth! I am bringing calamity on this people + As the fruitage of their own schemes, For they paid no attention to my words And they rejected my law.” * 20 “What do I care that you bring frankincense from Sheʹba And sweet cane * from a distant land? Your whole burnt offerings are not acceptable, And your sacrifices do not please me.” + 21 Therefore this is what Jehovah says: “Here I am setting for this people stumbling blocks, And they will stumble over them, Fathers and sons together, A neighbor and his companion, And they will all perish.” + 22 This is what Jehovah says: “Look! A people is coming from the land of the north, And a great nation will be awakened from the remotest parts of the earth. + 23 They will grab hold of the bow and the javelin. They are cruel and will have no mercy. Their voice will roar like the sea, And they ride on horses. + They draw up in battle order like a man of war against you, O daughter of Zion.” 24 We have heard the report about it. Our hands fall limp; + Distress has seized us, Anguish * like that of a woman giving birth. + 25 Do not go out into the field, And do not walk on the road, For the enemy has a sword; There is terror all around. 26 O daughter of my people, Put on sackcloth + and roll in the ashes. Mourn as for an only son, with bitter wailing, + For suddenly the destroyer will come upon us. + 27 “I have made you * a metal tester among my people, One making a thorough search; You must take note and examine their way. 28 All of them are the most stubborn men, + Walking about as slanderers. + They are like copper and iron; All of them are corrupt. 29 The bellows have been scorched. Out from their fire there is lead. One keeps refining intensely simply for nothing, + And those who are bad have not been separated. + 30 Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them, For Jehovah has rejected them.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Sanctify.” ^ Or “fresh.” ^ Or “fresh.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Lit., “Their ear is uncircumcised.” ^ Lit., “those full of days.” ^ Or “superficially.” ^ Or “fracture.” ^ Or “your souls.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ An aromatic reed. ^ Lit., “Birth pangs.” ^ That is, Jeremiah.
