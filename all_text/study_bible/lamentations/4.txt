Lamentations 4:1-22 א [ Aleph ] 4 How the shining gold has grown dim, the fine gold! + How the holy stones + lie scattered at every street corner! * + ב [ Beth ] 2 As for the precious sons of Zion, who were weighed against * refined gold, How they have been regarded as earthenware jars, The work of a potter’s hands! ג [ Gimel ] 3 Even jackals offer the udder to nurse their young, But the daughter of my people has become cruel, + like ostriches in the wilderness. + ד [ Daleth ] 4 The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to its palate because of thirst. Children beg for bread, + but no one gives them any. + ה [ He ] 5 Those who used to eat delicacies lie famished * in the streets. + Those who were brought up wearing scarlet + have embraced ash heaps. ו [ Waw ] 6 The punishment * of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment for the sin of Sodʹom, + Which was overthrown in a moment, with no hand to help her. + ז [ Zayin ] 7 Her Nazʹi·rites + were purer than snow, whiter than milk. They were more ruddy than corals; they were like polished sapphires. ח [ Heth ] 8 Their appearance has become darker than soot; * They are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled over their bones; + it has become like dry wood. ט [ Teth ] 9 Those slain with the sword are better off than those slain by famine, + Those who waste away, who are pierced through for lack of food from the field. י [ Yod ] 10 The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children. + They have become their food of mourning during the breakdown of the daughter of my people. + כ [ Kaph ] 11 Jehovah has expressed his wrath; He has poured out his burning anger. + And he starts a fire in Zion that consumes her foundations. + ל [ Lamed ] 12 The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the productive land did not believe That the adversary and the enemy would enter the gates of Jerusalem. + מ [ Mem ] 13 It was because of the sins of her prophets, the errors of her priests, + Who shed the blood of righteous ones in her midst. + נ [ Nun ] 14 They have wandered blindly + in the streets. They are polluted with blood, + So that none are able to touch their garments. ס [ Samekh ] 15 “Go away! Unclean!” they call out to them. “Go away! Go away! Do not touch us!” For they have gone homeless and wander about. People have said among the nations: “They cannot stay here with us. * + פ [ Pe ] 16 The face of Jehovah has scattered them; + He will no longer look favorably on them. Men will show no respect for the priests, + no favor to the elders.” + ע [ Ayin ] 17 Even now our eyes are worn out from looking in vain for help. + We looked and looked for help from a nation that could not save us. + צ [ Tsade ] 18 They have hunted us down at every step + so that we could not walk in our public squares. Our end has drawn near; our days have finished, for our end has come. ק [ Qoph ] 19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky. + They chased us on the mountains; they ambushed us in the wilderness. ר [ Resh ] 20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed one of Jehovah, + has been captured in their large pit, + The one of whom we said: “In his shade we will live among the nations.” ש [ Sin ] 21 Exult and rejoice, O daughter of Eʹdom, + living as you do in the land of Uz. But to you also the cup will be passed, + and you will become drunk and expose your nakedness. + ת [ Taw ] 22 The punishment for your error, O daughter of Zion, has come to its finish. He will not carry you off into exile again. + But he will turn his attention to your error, O daughter of Eʹdom. He will uncover your sins. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “at the head of all streets!” ^ Or “were as precious as.” ^ Lit., “desolate.” ^ Lit., “error.” ^ Lit., “blackness.” ^ Or “reside here as foreigners.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
