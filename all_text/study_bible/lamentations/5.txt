Lamentations 5:1-22 5 Remember, O Jehovah, what has befallen us. Look and see our disgrace. + 2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners. + 3 We have become orphans without a father; our mothers are like widows. + 4 We must pay to drink our own water, + and our own wood comes at a price. 5 Those pursuing us are at our neck; We are weary, but we are given no rest. + 6 We hold out our hand to Egypt + and to As·syrʹi·a, + to get enough bread to eat. 7 Our forefathers who sinned are no more, but we must bear their errors. 8 Servants now rule over us; there is no one to snatch us from their hand. 9 We bring in our bread at the risk of our life, * + because of the sword of the wilderness. 10 Our skin has become as hot as a furnace, because of the pangs of hunger. + 11 The wives in Zion they have humiliated, * the virgins in the cities of Judah. + 12 Princes were hanged by their hand, + and elders were shown no respect. + 13 Young men carry the hand mill, and boys stumble under loads of wood. 14 The elders are gone from the city gate; + young men do not play their music. + 15 The joy is gone from our heart; our dancing has turned into mourning. + 16 The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, because we have sinned! 17 Because of this our heart is sick, + And because of these things our eyes have grown dim, + 18 Because of Mount Zion, which is desolate; + foxes now roam on it. 19 As for you, O Jehovah, you sit enthroned forever. Your throne is for generation after generation. + 20 Why do you forget us forever and abandon us for so long a time? + 21 Bring us back to yourself, O Jehovah, and we will readily return to you. + Renew our days as in those of old. + 22 However, you have utterly rejected us. You remain intensely angry with us. + Footnotes ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “raped.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
