A Revelation to John 10:1-11 10 And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, arrayed * with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, + and his legs * were like pillars of fire, 2 and he had in his hand a little scroll that had been unrolled. And he set his right foot on the sea, but his left one on the earth, 3 and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion roars. + And when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders + spoke. 4 Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice out of heaven + say: “Seal up the things the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.” 5 The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, 6 and he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, + who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it: + “There will be no delay any longer. 7 But in the days when the seventh angel + is about to blow his trumpet, + the sacred secret + that God declared as good news to his own slaves the prophets + is indeed brought to a finish.” 8 And I heard the voice out of heaven + speaking again with me and saying: “Go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.” + 9 I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. He said to me: “Take it and eat it up, + and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.” 10 I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it, + and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, + but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter. 11 And they said to me: “You must prophesy again about peoples and nations and tongues * and many kings.” Footnotes ^ Or “wrapped.” ^ Lit., “feet.” ^ Or “languages.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
