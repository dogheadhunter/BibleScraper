A Revelation to John 4:1-11 4 After this I saw, and look! an opened door in heaven, and the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying: “Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place.” 2 After this I immediately came to be in the power of the spirit, and look! a throne was in its position in heaven, and someone was seated on the throne. + 3 And the One seated had the appearance of a jasper stone + and a sardius stone, * and all around the throne was a rainbow like an emerald in appearance. + 4 All around the throne were 24 thrones, and on these thrones I saw seated 24 elders + dressed in white garments, and on their heads golden crowns. 5 From the throne were coming lightning + and voices and thunders; + and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, and these mean the seven spirits of God. + 6 Before the throne was something resembling a glassy sea, + like crystal. In the midst of the throne * and around the throne were four living creatures + that were full of eyes in front and behind. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, + and the second living creature was like a young bull, + and the third living creature + had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature + was like a flying eagle. + 8 As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. + And continuously, day and night, they say: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah * + God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.” + 9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever, + 10 the 24 elders + fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship the One who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 “You are worthy, Jehovah * our God, to receive the glory + and the honor + and the power, + because you created all things, + and because of your will they came into existence and were created.” Footnotes ^ Or “a precious red-colored stone.” ^ Or “In the middle with the throne.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 .
