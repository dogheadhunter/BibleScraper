Ecclesiastes 7:1-29 7 A good name * is better than good oil, + and the day of death is better than the day of birth. 2 Better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting, + for that is the end of every man, and the living should take it to heart. 3 Better is distress than laughter, + for the sadness of the face makes the heart better. + 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of the stupid is in the house of rejoicing. * + 5 Better to listen to a wise man’s rebuke + than to listen to the song of fools. 6 For as the crackling of thorns burning under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool; + and this too is futility. 7 But oppression can drive the wise one into madness, and a bribe corrupts the heart. + 8 Better is the end of a matter than its beginning. Better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit. + 9 Do not be quick * to take offense, + for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools. * + 10 Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” for it is not out of wisdom that you ask this. + 11 Wisdom together with an inheritance is a good thing and an advantage to those who see the light of day. * 12 For wisdom is a protection + just as money is a protection, + but the advantage of knowledge is this: Wisdom preserves the life of its owner. + 13 Consider the work of the true God, for who can straighten out what he has made crooked? + 14 On a good day, reflect this goodness, + but on the day of adversity, * consider that God made the one as well as the other, + so that men cannot be certain of * anything that will happen to them in the future. + 15 During my futile life + I have seen everything—from the righteous one who perishes in his righteousness + to the wicked one who lives long despite his badness. + 16 Do not be overly righteous, + nor show yourself excessively wise. + Why should you bring ruin to yourself? + 17 Do not be excessively wicked, nor be foolish. + Why should you die before your time? + 18 It is best to grasp one warning without letting go of the other; + for the one who fears God will heed them both. 19 Wisdom makes a wise man more powerful than ten strong men in a city. + 20 For there is no righteous man on earth who always does good and never sins. + 21 Also, do not take to heart every word that people say; + otherwise, you may hear your servant calling down evil on * you; 22 for you well know in your heart that many times you yourself have called down evil on others. + 23 All of this I tested with wisdom, and I said: “I will become wise.” But it was beyond me. 24 What has come to be is out of reach and exceedingly deep. Who can understand it? + 25 I directed my heart to know and to explore and to search for wisdom and the reason behind things, and to understand the wickedness of stupidity and the folly of madness. + 26 Then I discovered this: More bitter than death is the woman who is like a hunter’s net, whose heart is like dragnets, and whose hands are like prison chains. The one who pleases the true God will escape her, + but the sinner is captured by her. + 27 “See, this is what I found,” says the congregator. + “I investigated one thing after another to reach my conclusion, 28 but what I * continually sought, I have not found. One man * out of a thousand I found, but a woman among them I have not found. 29 This alone I have found: The true God made mankind upright, + but they have sought out many schemes.” + Footnotes ^ Or “A good reputation.” Lit., “A name.” ^ Or “amusement.” ^ Or possibly, “is the mark of a fool.” ^ Lit., “hurry in your spirit.” ^ That is, those alive. ^ Or “discover.” ^ Or “calamity.” ^ Lit., “cursing.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “upright man.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
