Ecclesiastes 1:1-18 1 The words of the congregator, * + the son of David, the king in Jerusalem. + 2 “The greatest futility!” * says the congregator, “The greatest futility! Everything is futile!” + 3 What does a person gain from all his hard work At which he toils under the sun? + 4 A generation is going, and a generation is coming, But the earth remains * forever. + 5 The sun rises, * and the sun sets; Then it hurries back * to the place where it rises again. + 6 The wind goes south and circles around to the north; Round and round it continuously circles; the wind keeps making its rounds. 7 All the streams * flow into the sea, yet the sea is not full. + To the place from which the streams flow, there they return so as to flow again. + 8 All things are wearisome; No one can even speak of it. The eye is not satisfied at seeing; Nor is the ear filled from hearing. 9 What has been is what will be, And what has been done will be done again; There is nothing new under the sun. + 10 Is there anything of which one may say, “Look at this—it is new”? It already existed from long ago; It already existed before our time. 11 No one remembers people of former times; Nor will anyone remember those who come later; Nor will they be remembered by those who come still later. + 12 I, the congregator, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. + 13 I set my heart to study and explore with wisdom + everything that has been done under the heavens + —the miserable occupation that God has given to the sons of men that keeps them occupied. 14 I saw all the works that were done under the sun, And look! everything was futile, a chasing after the wind. + 15 What is crooked cannot be made straight, And what is lacking cannot possibly be counted. 16 Then I said in my heart: “Look! I have acquired great wisdom, more than anyone who was before me in Jerusalem, + and my heart gained a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.” + 17 I applied my heart to knowing wisdom and to knowing madness * and to knowing folly, + and this too is a chasing after the wind. 18 For an abundance of wisdom brings an abundance of frustration, So that whoever increases knowledge increases pain. + Footnotes ^ Or “assembler; convener.” ^ Or “vanity.” ^ Lit., “is standing.” ^ Or “shines forth.” ^ Or “returns panting.” ^ Or “winter streams; seasonal streams.” ^ Or “extreme foolishness.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
