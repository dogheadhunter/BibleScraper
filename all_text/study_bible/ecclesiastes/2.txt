Ecclesiastes 2:1-26 2 Then I said in my heart: “Come and let me try out pleasure * and see what good comes.” But look! that too was futility. 2 I said about laughter, “It is madness!” And about pleasure, * “What use is it?” 3 I explored with my heart by indulging myself with wine, + all the while maintaining my own wisdom; I even embraced foolishness to find out what was the best thing for humans to do during their few days of life under the heavens. 4 I undertook great works. + I built houses for myself; + I planted vineyards for myself. + 5 I made gardens and parks for myself, and I planted in them all sorts of fruit trees. 6 I made pools of water for myself, to irrigate a grove * of flourishing trees. 7 I acquired male and female servants, + and I had servants born in my household. * I also acquired much livestock—cattle and flocks + —more than any of my predecessors in Jerusalem. 8 I accumulated silver and gold for myself, + the treasures of * kings and of provinces. + I gathered male and female singers for myself, as well as what brings great pleasure to the sons of men—a woman, yes, many women. * 9 So I grew great and surpassed anyone prior to me in Jerusalem. + And my wisdom remained with me. 10 I did not deny myself anything that I desired. * + I did not withhold from my heart any sort of pleasure, * for my heart was joyful because of all my hard work, and this was my reward * for all my hard work. + 11 But when I reflected on all the works that my own hands had done and on all the hard work that I had toiled to accomplish, + I saw that everything was futile, a chasing after the wind; + there was nothing of real value * under the sun. + 12 Then I turned my attention to wisdom and madness and folly. + (For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.) 13 And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, + just as there is an advantage to light over darkness. 14 The wise one has his eyes in his head; * + but the stupid one is walking in darkness. + I have also come to realize that there is one outcome * that befalls all of them. + 15 Then I said in my heart: “What happens to the stupid one will also happen to me.” + What, then, did I gain by becoming excessively wise? So I said in my heart: “This too is futility.” 16 For there is no lasting memory either of the wise one or of the stupid one. + In the days to come, everyone will be forgotten. And how will the wise one die? Along with the stupid one. + 17 So I came to hate life, + because everything being done under the sun seemed distressing to me, for everything was futile, + a chasing after the wind. + 18 I came to hate all that I had worked so hard for under the sun, + because I must leave it behind for the man coming after me. + 19 And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? + Yet he will take control over all the things I spent great effort and wisdom to acquire under the sun. This too is futility. 20 So I began to despair in my heart over all the hard work at which I had toiled under the sun. 21 For a man may work hard, guided by wisdom and knowledge and skill, but he must hand over his portion * to a man who did not work for it. + This too is futility and a great tragedy. * 22 What does a man really gain from all his hard work and ambition that drives him * to work hard under the sun? + 23 For during all his days, his occupation brings pain and frustration, + and even at night his heart does not rest. + This too is futility. 24 There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and find enjoyment * in his hard work. + This too, I have realized, is from the hand of the true God, + 25 for who eats and who drinks better than I do? + 26 To the man who pleases him he gives wisdom and knowledge and rejoicing, + but to the sinner he gives the occupation of gathering and merely collecting to give to the one who pleases the true God. + This too is futility, a chasing after the wind.
