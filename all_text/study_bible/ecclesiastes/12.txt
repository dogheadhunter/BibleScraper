Ecclesiastes 12:1-14 12 Remember, then, your Grand Creator in the days of your youth, + before the days of distress * come + and the years arrive when you will say: “I have no pleasure in them”; 2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, + and the clouds return after * the downpour; 3 in the day when the guards * of the house become shaky, * and the strong men stoop over, and the women quit grinding because they have become few, and the ladies looking out the windows find it dark; + 4 when the doors to the street have been closed, when the sound of the grinding mill becomes low, when one gets up at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song grow faint. + 5 Also, one is afraid of heights, and there are terrors in the street. And the almond tree blossoms, + and the grasshopper drags itself along, and the caper berry bursts, because man is walking to his lasting house + and the mourners walk about in the street; + 6 before the silver cord is removed, and the golden bowl is crushed, and the jar at the spring is broken, and the waterwheel for the cistern is crushed. 7 Then the dust returns to the earth, + just as it was, and the spirit * returns to the true God who gave it. + 8 “The greatest futility!” * says the congregator. + “Everything is futile.” + 9 Not only had the congregator become wise but he continually taught the people what he knew, + and he pondered and made a thorough search in order to compile * many proverbs. + 10 The congregator sought to find delightful words + and to record accurate words of truth. 11 The words of the wise are like oxgoads, + and their collected sayings are like firmly embedded nails; they have been given from one shepherd. 12 As for anything besides these, my son, be warned: To the making of many books there is no end, and much devotion to them is wearisome to the flesh. + 13 The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God + and keep his commandments, + for this is the whole obligation of man. + 14 For the true God will judge every deed, including every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad. + Footnotes ^ Or “the calamitous days.” ^ Or possibly, “with.” ^ Or “keepers.” ^ Or “tremble.” ^ Or “life force.” ^ Or “vanity.” ^ Or “arrange in order.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
