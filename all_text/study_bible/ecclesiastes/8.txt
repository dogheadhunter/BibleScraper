Ecclesiastes 8:1-17 8 Who is like the wise man? Who knows the solution to a problem? * A man’s wisdom lights up his face and softens his stern appearance. 2 I say: “Obey the king’s orders + out of regard for the oath to God. + 3 Do not rush to depart from his presence. + Do not take a stand for anything bad; + for he can do whatever he pleases, 4 because the word of the king is absolute; + who can say to him, ‘What are you doing?’” 5 The one who observes the commandment will not experience harm, + and the wise heart will know the right time and procedure. * + 6 For every matter there is a time and procedure, * + because the troubles of mankind are so abundant. 7 Since no one knows what will happen, who can tell him how it will happen? 8 Just as no man has power over the spirit * or can restrain the spirit, so no one has power over the day of death. + Just as no one is discharged during a war, so wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape. * 9 All of this I have seen, and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun, during the time that man has dominated man to his harm. * + 10 And I saw the wicked being buried, those who used to go in and out of the holy place, but they were soon forgotten in the city where they acted that way. + This too is futility. 11 Because sentence against a bad deed has not been executed speedily, + the heart of men becomes emboldened to do bad. + 12 Although a sinner may do bad a hundred times and still live a long time, yet I am aware that it will turn out well for those who fear the true God, because they fear him. + 13 But it will not turn out well for the wicked one, + nor will he prolong his days that are like a shadow, + because he does not fear God. 14 There is something futile * that takes place on the earth: There are righteous people who are treated as if they had acted wickedly, + and there are wicked people who are treated as if they had acted righteously. + I say that this too is futility. 15 So I recommended rejoicing, + because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat and drink and rejoice; this should accompany him as he works hard during the days of his life, + which the true God gives him under the sun. 16 I applied my heart to acquire wisdom and to see all the activity * happening on the earth, + even going without sleep day and night. * 17 Then I considered all the work of the true God, and I realized that mankind cannot comprehend what happens under the sun. + No matter how hard men try, they cannot comprehend it. Even if they claim that they are wise enough to know, they cannot really comprehend it. + Footnotes ^ Or “the interpretation of a matter?” ^ Or “judgment.” ^ Or “judgment.” ^ Or “breath; wind.” ^ Or possibly, “their wickedness cannot rescue the wicked.” ^ Or “injury; detriment.” ^ Or “frustrating.” ^ Or “occupation.” ^ Or possibly, “that people do not see sleep either by day or by night.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
