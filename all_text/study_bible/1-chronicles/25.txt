The First of Chronicles 25:1-31 25 Further, David and the chiefs of the groups for the service separated some of the sons of Aʹsaph, Heʹman, and Je·duʹthun + to serve by prophesying with the harps, the stringed instruments, + and the cymbals. + The list of the official men for this service was, 2 of the sons of Aʹsaph: Zacʹcur, Joseph, Neth·a·niʹah, and Ash·a·reʹlah, the sons of Aʹsaph under the direction of Aʹsaph, who prophesied under the direction of the king. 3 Of Je·duʹthun, + the sons of Je·duʹthun: Ged·a·liʹah, Zeʹri, Je·shaʹiah, Shimʹe·i, Hash·a·biʹah, and Mat·ti·thiʹah, + six, under the direction of their father Je·duʹthun, who prophesied with the harp, thanking and praising Jehovah. + 4 Of Heʹman, + the sons of Heʹman: Buk·kiʹah, Mat·ta·niʹah, Uzʹzi·el, Shebʹu·el, Jerʹi·moth, Han·a·niʹah, Ha·naʹni, E·liʹa·thah, Gid·dalʹti, Ro·mamʹti-eʹzer, Josh·be·kashʹah, Mal·loʹthi, Hoʹthir, and Ma·haʹzi·oth. 5 All of these were sons of Heʹman, a visionary of the king in matters pertaining to the true God to his glory; * thus the true God gave Heʹman 14 sons and 3 daughters. 6 All of these were under the direction of their father for singing at the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps + for the service of the house of the true God. Under the king’s direction were Aʹsaph, Je·duʹthun, and Heʹman. 7 The number of them and their brothers who were trained in song to Jehovah, all experts, was 288. 8 So they cast lots + for their duties, the small and the great alike, the expert along with the learner. 9 The first lot to come out belonged to Aʹsaph for Joseph, + the second for Ged·a·liʹah + (he and his brothers and his sons were 12); 10 the third for Zacʹcur, + his sons and his brothers, 12; 11 the fourth for Izʹri, his sons and his brothers, 12; 12 the fifth for Neth·a·niʹah, + his sons and his brothers, 12; 13 the sixth for Buk·kiʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 14 the seventh for Jesh·a·reʹlah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 15 the eighth for Je·shaʹiah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 16 the ninth for Mat·ta·niʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 17 the tenth for Shimʹe·i, his sons and his brothers, 12; 18 the 11th for Azʹar·el, his sons and his brothers, 12; 19 the 12th for Hash·a·biʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 20 for the 13th, Shuʹba·el, + his sons and his brothers, 12; 21 for the 14th, Mat·ti·thiʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 22 for the 15th, for Jerʹe·moth, his sons and his brothers, 12; 23 for the 16th, for Han·a·niʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 24 for the 17th, for Josh·be·kashʹah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 25 for the 18th, for Ha·naʹni, his sons and his brothers, 12; 26 for the 19th, for Mal·loʹthi, his sons and his brothers, 12; 27 for the 20th, for E·liʹa·thah, his sons and his brothers, 12; 28 for the 21st, for Hoʹthir, his sons and his brothers, 12; 29 for the 22nd, for Gid·dalʹti, + his sons and his brothers, 12; 30 for the 23rd, for Ma·haʹzi·oth, + his sons and his brothers, 12; 31 for the 24th, for Ro·mamʹti-eʹzer, + his sons and his brothers, 12.
