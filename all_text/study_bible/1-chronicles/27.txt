These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. 23 David did not count those 20 years of age and under, because Jehovah had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of the heavens. + 24 Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah had started to take the count, but he did not finish; and God’s anger came against Israel * because of this, + and the number was not entered into the account of the history of the times of King David. 25 Over the treasuries of the king + was Azʹma·veth the son of Adʹi·el.
