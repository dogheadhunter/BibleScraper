Genesis 25:1-34 25 Now Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Ke·tuʹrah. 2 In time she bore him Zimʹran, Jokʹshan, Meʹdan, Midʹi·an, + Ishʹbak, and Shuʹah. + 3 Jokʹshan became father to Sheʹba and Deʹdan. The sons of Deʹdan were As·shuʹrim, Le·tuʹshim, and Le·umʹmim. 4 The sons of Midʹi·an were Eʹphah, Eʹpher, Haʹnoch, A·biʹda, and El·daʹah. All of these were the sons of Ke·tuʹrah. 5 Later on Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac, + 6 but Abraham gave gifts to his sons by his concubines. Then while he was still alive, he sent them eastward, away from Isaac his son, + to the land of the East. 7 The years of Abraham’s life were 175 years. 8 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, old and satisfied, and was gathered to his people. * 9 His sons Isaac and Ishʹma·el buried him in the cave of Mach·peʹlah in the field of Eʹphron the son of Zoʹhar the Hitʹtite that is in front of Mamʹre, + 10 the field that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, with his wife Sarah. + 11 After Abraham’s death, God continued to bless his son Isaac, + and Isaac was dwelling near Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. + 12 This is the history of Ishʹma·el + the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar + the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah, bore to Abraham. 13 Now these are the names of the sons of Ishʹma·el, by their names according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s firstborn Ne·baʹioth, + then Keʹdar, + Adʹbe·el, Mibʹsam, + 14 Mishʹma, Duʹmah, Masʹsa, 15 Haʹdad, Teʹma, Jeʹtur, Naʹphish, and Kedʹe·mah. 16 These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their settlements and by their encampments, * 12 chieftains according to their clans. + 17 And Ishʹma·el lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people. * 18 And they took up dwelling from Havʹi·lah + near Shur, + which is close to Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. He settled near all his brothers. * + 19 And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham. + Abraham became father to Isaac. 20 Isaac was 40 years old when he married Re·bekʹah, the daughter of Be·thuʹel + the A·ra·maeʹan of Padʹdan-aʹram, the sister of Laʹban the A·ra·maeʹan. 21 And Isaac kept pleading with Jehovah regarding his wife, because she was barren; so Jehovah responded to his plea, and his wife Re·bekʹah became pregnant. 22 And the sons within her began to struggle with each other, + so that she said: “If this is the way it is, why should I go on living?” So she inquired of Jehovah. 23 And Jehovah said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, + and two peoples will be separated from within you; + and the one nation will be stronger than the other nation, + and the older will serve the younger.” + 24 When the time came for her to give birth, look! twins were in her womb. 25 Then the first came out red all over and was like a garment of hair, + so they named him Eʹsau. * + 26 After that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau, + so he named him Jacob. * + Isaac was 60 years old when she gave birth to them. 27 As the boys got bigger, Eʹsau became a skilled hunter, + a man of the field, but Jacob was a blameless man, dwelling in tents. + 28 And Isaac loved Eʹsau because it meant game in his mouth, whereas Re·bekʹah loved Jacob. + 29 On one occasion Jacob was boiling some stew when Eʹsau returned from the field exhausted. 30 So Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me some * of the red stew that you have there, * for I am exhausted!” * That is why his name was Eʹdom. * + 31 To this Jacob said: “First sell me your right as firstborn!” + 32 And Eʹsau continued: “Here I am about to die! What use is a birthright to me?” 33 And Jacob added: “Swear to me first!” So he swore to him and sold his right as firstborn to Jacob. + 34 Then Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and he got up and went away. Thus Eʹsau despised the birthright.
