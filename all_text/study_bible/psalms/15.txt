Psalm 15:1-5 A melody of David. 15 O Jehovah, who may be a guest in your tent? Who may reside in your holy mountain? + 2 The one who is walking faultlessly, * + Practicing what is right + And speaking the truth in his heart. + 3 He does not slander with his tongue, + He does nothing bad to his neighbor, + And he does not defame * his friends. + 4 He rejects anyone who is contemptible, + But he honors those fearing Jehovah. He does not go back on his promise, * even when it is bad for him. + 5 He does not lend his money on interest, + And he does not accept a bribe against the innocent. + Whoever does these things will never be shaken. * + Footnotes ^ Or “with integrity.” ^ Or “shame.” ^ Lit., “oath.” ^ Or “will never stagger (totter).” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
