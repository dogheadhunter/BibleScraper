Psalm 40:1-17 To the director. Of David. A melody. 40 I earnestly hoped in * Jehovah, And he inclined his ear * to me and heard my cry for help. + 2 He brought me up out of a roaring pit, Out of the slimy mire. And he set my feet upon a crag; He made my footing secure. 3 Then he put a new song in my mouth, + Praise to our God. Many will look on in awe And put their trust in Jehovah. 4 Happy is the man who trusts in Jehovah And who does not look to the defiant or to those who are false. * 5 How many things you have done, O Jehovah my God, Your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us. + None can compare to you; + If I were to try to tell and speak of them, They would be too numerous to recount! + 6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, * + But you opened up my ears to hear. + You did not ask for burnt offerings and sin offerings. + 7 Then I said: “Look, I have come. In the scroll * it is written about me. + 8 To do your will, O my God, is my delight, * + And your law is deep within me. + 9 I proclaim the good news of righteousness in the great congregation. + Look! I do not restrain my lips, + O Jehovah, as you well know. 10 I do not cover over your righteousness in my heart. I declare your faithfulness and salvation. I do not hide your loyal love and your truth in the great congregation.” + 11 O Jehovah, do not withhold your mercy from me. May your loyal love and your truth constantly safeguard me. + 12 The calamities surrounding me are too many to count. + So many of my errors overwhelm me that I cannot see my way; + They are more numerous than the hairs of my head, And I have lost heart. 13 Please be willing, O Jehovah, to save me. + O Jehovah, hurry to help me. + 14 May all those seeking to take my life * Be put to shame and disgraced. May those who delight in my calamity Retreat in humiliation. 15 May those who are saying to me: “Aha! Aha!” Be appalled because of their own shame. 16 But let those seeking you + Exult and rejoice in you. + May those who love your acts of salvation always say: “May Jehovah be magnified.” + 17 But I am helpless and poor; May Jehovah pay attention to me. You are my helper and my rescuer; + My God, do not delay. + Footnotes ^ Or “waited patiently for.” ^ Or “bent down to listen.” ^ Or “to liars.” ^ Or “delight in.” ^ Lit., “the scroll of the book.” ^ Or “desire.” ^ Or “soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
