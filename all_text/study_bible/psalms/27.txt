Psalm 27:1-14 Of David. 27 Jehovah is my light + and my salvation. Whom should I fear? + Jehovah is the stronghold of my life. + Whom should I dread? 2 When evil men attacked me to devour my flesh, + My adversaries and my enemies were the ones who stumbled and fell. 3 Though an army should set up camp against me, My heart will not fear. + Though war should break out against me, Even then I will remain confident. 4 One thing I have asked from Jehovah —It is what I will look for— That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, + To gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah And to look with appreciation * upon his temple. * + 5 For he will hide me in his shelter on the day of calamity; + He will conceal me in the secret place of his tent; + High on a rock he will place me. + 6 Now my head is high above my enemies who surround me; I will offer sacrifices at his tent with joyful shouting; I will sing praises * to Jehovah. 7 Hear me, O Jehovah, when I cry out; + Show me favor and answer me. + 8 Speaking for you, my heart has said: “Seek to find my face.” Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek to find. + 9 Do not hide your face from me. + Do not turn your servant away in your anger. You are my helper; + Do not forsake me or leave me, my God of salvation. 10 Even if my own father and mother abandon me, + Jehovah himself will take me in. + 11 Instruct me in your way, O Jehovah, + Lead me in the path of uprightness because of my foes. 12 Do not hand me over to my adversaries, * + For false witnesses have risen up against me, + And they threaten me with violence. 13 Where would I be if I did not have faith That I would see Jehovah’s goodness in the land of the living? * + 14 Hope in Jehovah; + Be courageous and strong of heart. + Yes, hope in Jehovah.
