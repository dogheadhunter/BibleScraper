Psalm 80:1-19 To the director; set to “The Lilies.” A reminder. Of Aʹsaph. + A melody. 80 O Shepherd of Israel, listen, You who are guiding Joseph just like a flock. + You who sit enthroned above * the cherubs, + Shine forth. * 2 Before Eʹphra·im and Benjamin and Ma·nasʹseh, Do stir up your mightiness; + Come and save us. + 3 O God, restore us; + Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved. + 4 Jehovah God of armies, how long will you be hostile toward * the prayer of your people? + 5 You feed them tears as their bread, And you make them drink tears beyond measure. 6 You let our neighbors quarrel over us; Our enemies keep mocking us as they please. + 7 O God of armies, restore us; Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved. + 8 You made a vine + depart from Egypt. You drove out the nations and planted it. + 9 You cleared a space for it, And it took root and filled the land. + 10 The mountains were covered by its shadow, And the cedars of God by its branches. 11 Its branches reached as far as the sea, And its shoots to the River. * + 12 Why have you broken down the stone walls of the vineyard, + So that all those passing by pluck its fruit? + 13 The boars of the forest ravage it, And the wild animals of the field feed on it. + 14 O God of armies, please return. Look down from heaven and see! Take care of this vine, + 15 The stock * that your right hand has planted, + And look upon the son whom * you made strong for yourself. + 16 It is burned with fire, + cut down. They perish at your rebuke. * 17 May your hand give support to the man at your right hand, To the son of man you have made strong for yourself. + 18 Then we will not turn away from you. Preserve us alive, so that we may call on your name. 19 O Jehovah God of armies, restore us; Let your face shine upon us, so that we may be saved. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “between.” ^ Or “Reveal your radiance.” ^ Lit., “fume against.” ^ That is, the Euphrates. ^ Or “main stem of the vine.” ^ Or “branch that.” ^ Lit., “the rebuke of your face.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
