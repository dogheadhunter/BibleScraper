Psalm 140:1-13 For the director. A melody of David. 140 Rescue me, O Jehovah, from evil men; Protect me from violent men, + 2 Those who scheme evil in their hearts + And stir up conflict all day long. 3 They sharpen their tongue like that of a serpent; + Venom of vipers is behind their lips. + ( Selah ) 4 Protect me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked; + Safeguard me from violent men, Those who scheme to trip me. 5 The haughty ones hide a trap for me; With ropes they spread out a net beside the path. + They set snares for me. + ( Selah ) 6 I say to Jehovah: “You are my God. Listen, O Jehovah, to my pleas for help.” + 7 O Jehovah the Sovereign Lord, my strong Savior, You shield my head in the day of battle. + 8 Do not grant, O Jehovah, the desires of the wicked. Do not let their plots succeed, so that they are not exalted. + ( Selah ) 9 May the heads of those surrounding me Be covered with the evil spoken by their lips. + 10 May burning coals rain down on them. + May they be hurled into the fire, Into deep pits, * + never to rise again. 11 May the slanderer find no place on the earth. * + May evil pursue men of violence and strike them down. 12 I know that Jehovah will defend the lowly And give justice to the poor. + 13 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name; The upright will dwell before your face. * + Footnotes ^ Or “Into watery pits.” ^ Or “in the land.” ^ Or “in your presence.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
