Psalm 3:1-8 A melody of David when he was fleeing from his son Abʹsa·lom. + 3 O Jehovah, why have my adversaries become so numerous? + Why are so many rising up against me? + 2 Many are saying about me: * “God will not save him.” + ( Selah ) * 3 But you, O Jehovah, are a shield around me, + My glory + and the One who lifts up my head. + 4 I will call aloud to Jehovah, And he will answer me from his holy mountain. + ( Selah ) 5 I will lie down and sleep; And I will wake up in safety, For Jehovah continues to support me. + 6 I am not afraid of the tens of thousands Lined up against me on every side. + 7 Rise up, O Jehovah! Save me, + O my God! For you will strike all my enemies on the jaw; You will break the teeth of the wicked. + 8 Salvation belongs to Jehovah. + Your blessing is upon your people.
