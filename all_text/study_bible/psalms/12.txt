Psalm 12:1-8 To the director; tuned to Shemʹi·nith. * A melody of David. 12 Save me, O Jehovah, for the loyal one is no more; Faithful people have vanished from among men. 2 They speak lies to one another; They flatter with their lips * and speak with deceitful hearts. * + 3 Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips And the tongue that makes great boasts, + 4 Those who say: “We will prevail with our tongues. We use our lips as we please; Who will be our master?” + 5 “Because the afflicted are oppressed, Because of the sighing of the poor, + I will rise up to act,” says Jehovah. “I will save them from those who treat them with contempt.” * 6 The sayings of Jehovah are pure; + They are like silver refined in an earthen furnace, * purified seven times. 7 You will guard them, O Jehovah; + You will protect each one of them from this generation forever. 8 The wicked walk around unrestrained Because the sons of men promote depravity. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Lit., “speak with a smooth lip.” ^ Lit., “with a heart and a heart.” ^ Or “puff at them.” ^ Or possibly, “a smelting furnace set on the ground.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
