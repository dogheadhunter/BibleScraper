Psalm 32:1-11 Of David. Masʹkil. * 32 Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. * + 2 Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt, + In whose spirit there is no deceit. 3 When I kept silent, my bones wasted away because of my groaning all day long. + 4 For day and night your hand * was heavy upon me. + My strength evaporated * like water in the dry summer heat. ( Selah ) 5 Finally I confessed my sin to you; I did not cover my error. + I said: “I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah.” + And you pardoned the error of my sins. + ( Selah ) 6 This is why every loyal one will pray to you + While you may yet be found. + Then even the floodwaters will not reach him. 7 You are a hiding place for me; You will safeguard me from distress. + You will surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance. + ( Selah ) 8 “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go. + I will give you advice with my eye upon you. + 9 Do not become like a horse or a mule, without understanding, + Whose spiritedness must be controlled with a bridle or a halter Before it will come near to you.” 10 Many are the pains of the wicked; But the one trusting in Jehovah is surrounded by His loyal love. + 11 Rejoice in Jehovah and be joyful, you righteous ones; Shout joyfully, all you who are upright in heart.
