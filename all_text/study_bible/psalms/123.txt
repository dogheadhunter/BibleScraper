Psalm 123:1-4 A Song of the Ascents. 123 To you I raise my eyes, + You who are enthroned in the heavens. 2 As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, And the eyes of a servant girl to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to Jehovah our God + Until he shows us favor. + 3 Show us favor, O Jehovah, show us favor, For we have had our full share of contempt. + 4 We have had our full share of * ridicule from the self-assured And the contempt of the arrogant.
