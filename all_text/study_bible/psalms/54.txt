Masʹkil. * Of David, when the Ziphʹites came in and said to Saul: “David is hiding among us.” + 54 O God, save me by your name, + And defend me * + with your power. 2 O God, hear my prayer; + Pay attention to the words of my mouth. 3 For strangers rise up against me, And ruthless men seek my life. * + They have no regard for God. * + ( Selah ) 4 Look! God is my helper; + Jehovah is with those supporting me. * 5 He will repay my foes + with their own evil; In your faithfulness, put an end to * them. + 6 I will sacrifice to you + willingly. I will praise your name, O Jehovah, for it is good. + 7 For he saves me from every distress, + And I will look in triumph on my enemies. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “plead my cause.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “They do not keep God before them.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Lit., “silence.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
