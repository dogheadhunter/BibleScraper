Psalm 20:1-9 To the director. A melody of David. 20 May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you. + 2 May he send you help from the holy place + And sustain you from Zion. + 3 May he remember all your gift offerings; May he accept with favor * your burnt offering. ( Selah ) 4 May he grant you the desires of your heart + And give success to all your plans. * 5 We will shout joyfully over your acts of salvation; + We will lift our banners in the name of our God. + May Jehovah fulfill all your requests. 6 Now I do know that Jehovah saves his anointed one. + He answers him from his holy heavens With great salvation * by his right hand. + 7 Some rely on chariots and others on horses, + But we call on the name of Jehovah our God. + 8 They have collapsed and fallen, But we have risen up and been restored. + 9 O Jehovah, save the king! + He will answer us in the day we call for help. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “consider as being fat.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “victories.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
