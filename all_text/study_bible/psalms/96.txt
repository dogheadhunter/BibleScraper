Psalm 96:1-13 96 Sing to Jehovah a new song. + Sing to Jehovah, all the earth! + 2 Sing to Jehovah; praise his name. Proclaim the good news of his salvation day after day. + 3 Declare his glory among the nations, His wonderful works among all the peoples. + 4 Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise. He is more awe-inspiring than all other gods. 5 All the gods of the peoples are worthless gods, + But Jehovah is the one who made the heavens. + 6 In his presence are majesty * and splendor; + Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. + 7 Give Jehovah his due, you families of the peoples, Give Jehovah his due for his glory and strength. + 8 Give Jehovah the glory due his name; + Bring a gift and come into his courtyards. 9 Bow down to * Jehovah in holy adornment; * Tremble before him, all the earth! 10 Declare among the nations: “Jehovah has become King! + The earth * is firmly established, it cannot be moved. * He will judge * the peoples fairly.” + 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful; Let the sea thunder and all that fills it; + 12 Let the fields and everything in them rejoice. + At the same time let all the trees of the forest shout joyfully + 13 Before Jehovah, for he is coming, * He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the inhabited earth * with righteousness + And the peoples with his faithfulness. + Footnotes ^ Or “dignity.” ^ Or possibly, “because of the splendor of his holiness.” ^ Or “Worship.” ^ Or “productive land.” ^ Or “cannot totter.” ^ Or “plead the cause of.” ^ Or “has come.” ^ Or “the productive land.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
