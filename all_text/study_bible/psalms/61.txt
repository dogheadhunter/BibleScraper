Psalm 61:1-8 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. Of David. 61 Hear, O God, my cry for help. Do pay attention to my prayer. + 2 From the ends of the earth I will cry out to you When my heart is in despair. * + Lead me onto a rock that is higher than I am. + 3 For you are my refuge, A strong tower that protects me from the enemy. + 4 I will be a guest in your tent forever; + I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. + ( Selah ) 5 For you, O God, have heard my vows. You have given me the inheritance belonging to those who fear your name. + 6 You will add days to the life * of the king, + And his years will be from generation to generation. 7 He will sit enthroned * forever before God; + Grant him * loyal love and faithfulness, so that these may safeguard him. + 8 Then I will sing praises * to your name forever + As I pay my vows day after day. + Footnotes ^ Or “grows feeble.” ^ Lit., “days.” ^ Or “will dwell.” ^ Or “Assign.” ^ Or “make music.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
