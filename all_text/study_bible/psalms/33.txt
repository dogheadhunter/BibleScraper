Psalm 33:1-22 33 Shout joyfully, you righteous ones, because of Jehovah. + It is fitting for the upright to praise him. 2 Give thanks to Jehovah with the harp; Sing praises * to him with a ten-stringed instrument. 3 Sing to him a new song; + Play skillfully on the strings, along with shouts of joy. 4 For the word of Jehovah is upright, + And everything he does is trustworthy. 5 He loves righteousness and justice. + The earth is filled with Jehovah’s loyal love. + 6 By the word of Jehovah the heavens were made, + And by the spirit * of his mouth everything in them. * 7 He gathers the seawaters like a dam; + He puts the surging waters in storehouses. 8 Let the whole earth fear Jehovah. + Let the inhabitants of the productive land be in awe of him. 9 For he spoke, and it came to be; + He commanded, and it stood firm. + 10 Jehovah has frustrated the schemes * of the nations; + He has thwarted the plans * of the peoples. + 11 But the decisions * of Jehovah will stand forever; + The thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation. 12 Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, + The people he has chosen as his own possession. + 13 Jehovah looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men. + 14 From his place of residence, He gazes on the inhabitants of the earth. 15 He is the one forming the hearts of all; He examines all their works. + 16 No king is saved by a large army; + A mighty man is not saved by his great power. + 17 The horse is a false hope for salvation; * + Its great strength does not ensure escape. 18 Look! The eye of Jehovah watches over those fearing him, + Those waiting for his loyal love, 19 To rescue them * from death And to keep them alive during famine. + 20 We are * in expectation of Jehovah. He is our helper and our shield. + 21 Our hearts rejoice in him, For we trust in his holy name. + 22 May your loyal love rest upon us, O Jehovah, + While we keep waiting for you. + Footnotes ^ Or “Make music.” ^ Or “breath.” ^ Lit., “all their army.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “thoughts.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “for victory.” ^ Or “their soul.” ^ Or “Our soul is.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
