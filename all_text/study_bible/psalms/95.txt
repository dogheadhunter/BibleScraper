Psalm 95:1-11 95 Come, let us shout joyfully to Jehovah! Let us shout in triumph to our Rock of salvation. + 2 Let us come into his presence * with thanksgiving; + Let us sing and shout in triumph to him. 3 For Jehovah is a great God, A great King over all other gods. + 4 In his hand are the depths of the earth; The mountain peaks belong to him. + 5 The sea, which he made, belongs to him, + And his hands formed the dry land. + 6 Come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker. + 7 For he is our God, And we are the people of his pasture, The sheep in his care. * + Today if you listen to his voice, + 8 Do not harden your heart as at Merʹi·bah, * + As in the day of Masʹsah * in the wilderness, + 9 When your forefathers tested me; + They challenged me, though they had seen my works. + 10 For 40 years I felt a loathing toward that generation, and I said: “They are a people who always go astray in their hearts; They have not come to know my ways.” 11 So I swore in my anger: “They will not enter into my rest.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “before his face.” ^ Lit., “of his hand.” ^ Meaning “Quarreling.” ^ Meaning “Testing; Trial.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
