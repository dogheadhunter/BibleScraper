Psalm 55:1-23 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. Masʹkil. * Of David. 55 Listen to my prayer, O God, + And do not ignore my request for mercy. * + 2 Do pay attention to me and answer me. + My concern makes me restless, + And I am distraught 3 Because of what the enemy is saying And the pressure from the wicked one. For they heap trouble upon me, And in anger they harbor animosity against me. + 4 My heart is in anguish within me, + And the terrors of death overwhelm me. + 5 Fear and trembling come upon me, And shuddering grips me. 6 I keep saying: “If only I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and reside in safety. 7 Look! I would flee far away. + I would lodge in the wilderness. + ( Selah ) 8 I would hurry to a place of shelter Away from the raging wind, away from the storm.” 9 Confuse them, O Jehovah, and frustrate their plans, * + For I have seen violence and conflict in the city. 10 Day and night they walk around on its walls; Within it are malice and trouble. + 11 Ruin is in its midst; Oppression and deception never depart from its public square. + 12 For it is not an enemy who taunts me; + Otherwise I could put up with it. It is not a foe who has risen up against me; Otherwise I could conceal myself from him. 13 But it is you, a man like me, * + My own companion whom I know well. + 14 We used to enjoy a warm friendship together; Into the house of God we used to walk along with the multitude. 15 May destruction overtake them! + Let them go down alive into the Grave; * For evil resides among them and within them. 16 As for me, I will call out to God, And Jehovah will save me. + 17 Evening and morning and noontime, I am troubled and I groan, * + And he hears my voice. + 18 He will rescue * me and give me * peace from those fighting against me, For multitudes come against me. + 19 God will hear and respond to them, + The one who sits enthroned from of old. + ( Selah ) They will refuse to change, Those who have not feared God. + 20 He * attacked those at peace with him; + He violated his covenant. + 21 His words are smoother than butter, + But conflict is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, But they are drawn swords. + 22 Throw your burden on Jehovah, + And he will sustain you. + Never will he allow the righteous one to fall. * + 23 But you, O God, will bring them down to the deepest pit. + Those bloodguilty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. + But as for me, I will trust in you.
