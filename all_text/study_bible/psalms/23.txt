Psalm 23:1-6 A melody of David. 23 Jehovah is my Shepherd. + I will lack nothing. + 2 In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; He leads me to well-watered resting-places. * + 3 He refreshes me. * + He leads me in the paths * of righteousness for the sake of his name. + 4 Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, + I fear no harm, + For you are with me; + Your rod and your staff reassure me. * 5 You prepare a table for me before my enemies. + You refresh * my head with oil; + My cup is well-filled. + 6 Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life, + And I will dwell in the house of Jehovah for all my days. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “to tranquil waters.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Lit., “tracks.” ^ Or “comfort me.” ^ Or “grease.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
