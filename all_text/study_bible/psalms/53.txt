Psalm 53:1-6 To the director; in the style of Maʹha·lath. * Masʹkil. * Of David. 53 The foolish * one says in his heart: “There is no Jehovah.” + Their unrighteous actions are corrupt and detestable; No one is doing good. + 2 But God looks down from heaven on the sons of men + To see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah. + 3 They have all turned away; They are all alike corrupt. No one is doing good, Not even one. + 4 Do none of the wrongdoers understand? They devour my people as if they were eating bread. They do not call on Jehovah. + 5 But they will be filled with great terror, Terror they have never felt before, * For God will scatter the bones of those attacking you. * You will put them to shame, for Jehovah has rejected them. 6 O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion! + When Jehovah gathers back his captive people, Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.
