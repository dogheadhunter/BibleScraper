Psalm 14:1-7 To the director. Of David. 14 The foolish * one says in his heart: “There is no Jehovah.” + Their actions are corrupt, and their dealings are detestable; No one is doing good. + 2 But Jehovah looks down from heaven on the sons of men To see whether anyone has insight, whether anyone is seeking Jehovah. + 3 They have all turned aside; + They are all alike corrupt. No one is doing good, Not even one. 4 Do none of the wrongdoers understand? They devour my people as if they were eating bread. They do not call on Jehovah. 5 But they will be filled with great terror, + For Jehovah is with the generation of the righteous. 6 You wrongdoers try to frustrate the plans of the lowly one, But Jehovah is his refuge. + 7 O that Israel’s salvation may come from Zion! + When Jehovah gathers back his captive people, Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice.
