Psalm 42:1-11 To the director. Masʹkil * of the sons of Korʹah. + 42 As a deer that longs for streams of water, So I long * for you, O God. 2 I do thirst * for God, for the living God. + When may I come and appear before God? + 3 My tears are my food day and night; All day long people taunt me: “Where is your God?” + 4 These things I remember, and I pour out my soul, * For I once walked along with the multitude; I used to walk solemnly * before them to the house of God, With sounds of rejoicing and thanksgiving, Those of a crowd celebrating a festival. + 5 Why am I * in despair? + Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God, + For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior. + 6 My God, I am * in despair. + That is why I remember you, + From the land of Jordan and the peaks of Herʹmon, From Mount Mi·zarʹ. * 7 Deep waters call to deep waters At the sound of your waterfalls. All your surging waves have overwhelmed me. + 8 By day Jehovah will grant me his loyal love, And by night his song will be with me—a prayer to the God of my life. + 9 I will say to God, my crag: “Why have you forgotten me? + Why should I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy?” + 10 With murderous hostility * my enemies taunt me; All day long they taunt me: “Where is your God?” + 11 Why am I * in despair? Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God, + For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “my soul longs.” ^ Or “My soul thirsts.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “slowly.” ^ Or “is my soul.” ^ Or “my soul is.” ^ Or “the little mountain.” ^ Or possibly, “As if crushing my bones.” ^ Or “is my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
