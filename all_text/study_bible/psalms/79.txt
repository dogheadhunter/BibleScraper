Psalm 79:1-13 A melody of Aʹsaph. + 79 O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; + They have defiled your holy temple; + They have turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins. + 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the heavens And the flesh of your loyal ones to the wild beasts of the earth. + 3 They have poured out their blood like water around Jerusalem, And no one is left to bury them. + 4 We have become an object of reproach to our neighbors; + Those around us ridicule and jeer us. 5 How long, O Jehovah, will you be furious? Forever? + How long will your indignation burn just like fire? + 6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not know you And on the kingdoms that do not call on your name. + 7 For they have devoured Jacob And have desolated his homeland. + 8 Do not hold us accountable for the errors of our ancestors. + Quickly show us your mercy, + For we have been brought very low. 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, + For the sake of your glorious name; Rescue us and forgive * our sins for the sake of your name. + 10 Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?” + Before our eyes may it become known among the nations That the shed blood of your servants has been avenged. + 11 May you hear the sighing of the prisoner. + Use your great power * to preserve * those sentenced to death. * + 12 Repay our neighbors sevenfold + For the taunts they have leveled at you, O Jehovah. + 13 Then we, your people and the flock of your pasture, + Will give thanks to you forever; And we will declare your praise from generation to generation. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “cover.” ^ Lit., “arm.” ^ Or possibly, “set free.” ^ Lit., “the sons of death.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
