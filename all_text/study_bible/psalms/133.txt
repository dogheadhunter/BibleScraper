Psalm 133:1-3 A Song of the Ascents. Of David. 133 Look! How good and how pleasant it is For brothers to dwell together in unity! + 2 It is like fine oil poured on the head + That runs down the beard, Aaron’s beard, + And runs down onto the collar of his garments. 3 It is like the dew of Herʹmon + That descends on the mountains of Zion. + That is where Jehovah decreed his blessing —Life everlasting.
