Psalm 84:1-12 For the director; upon the Gitʹtith. * Of the sons of Korʹah. + A melody. 84 How lovely * your grand tabernacle is, + O Jehovah of armies! 2 My whole being * yearns, Yes, I am faint with longing, For the courtyards of Jehovah. + My heart and my flesh shout joyfully to the living God. 3 Even the bird finds a home there And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she cares for her young Near your grand altar, O Jehovah of armies, My King and my God! 4 Happy are those dwelling in your house! + They continue to praise you. + ( Selah ) 5 Happy are the men who find their strength in you, + Whose hearts are set on the highways. 6 When they pass through the Baʹca Valley, * They make it into a place of springs; And the early rain clothes it * with blessings. 7 They will walk on from strength to strength; + Each one appears before God in Zion. 8 O Jehovah God of armies, hear my prayer; Listen, O God of Jacob. ( Selah ) 9 Look, our shield + and our God, * Look upon the face of your anointed one. + 10 For a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand anywhere else! + I choose to stand at the threshold of the house of my God Rather than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 11 For Jehovah God is a sun + and a shield; + He gives favor and glory. Jehovah will not hold back anything good From those walking in integrity. + 12 O Jehovah of armies, Happy is the man who trusts in you. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “deeply loved.” ^ Or “My soul.” ^ Or “the valley of baca bushes.” ^ Or possibly, “And the instructor enwraps himself.” ^ Or possibly, “Look at our shield, O God.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
