Psalm 9:1-20 To the director; upon Muth-labʹben. * A melody of David. א [ Aleph ] 9 I will praise you, O Jehovah, with all my heart; I will tell about all your wonderful works. + 2 I will rejoice and exult in you; I will sing praises * to your name, O Most High. + ב [ Beth ] 3 When my enemies retreat, + They will stumble and perish from before you. 4 For you defend my just cause; You sit on your throne judging with righteousness. + ג [ Gimel ] 5 You have rebuked nations + and destroyed the wicked, Blotting out their name forever and ever. 6 The enemy has been ruined forever; You uprooted their cities, And all memory of them will perish. + ה [ He ] 7 But Jehovah is enthroned forever; + He has firmly established his throne for justice. + 8 He will judge the inhabited earth * in righteousness; + He will render righteous legal decisions for the nations. + ו [ Waw ] 9 Jehovah will become a secure refuge * for the oppressed, + A secure refuge in times of distress. + 10 Those knowing your name will trust in you; + You will never abandon those seeking you, O Jehovah. + ז [ Zayin ] 11 Sing praises to Jehovah, who is dwelling in Zion; Make his deeds known among the peoples. + 12 For the One who avenges their blood remembers them; + He will not forget the cry of the afflicted. + ח [ Heth ] 13 Show me favor, O Jehovah; see my affliction by those hating me, You who raise me from the gates of death, + 14 So that I may declare your praiseworthy deeds in the gates of the daughter of Zion, + And rejoice in your acts of salvation. + ט [ Teth ] 15 The nations have sunk down into the pit they made; Their own foot has been caught in the net they hid. + 16 Jehovah is known by the judgment he executes. + The wicked one has been ensnared in the work of his own hands. + Hig·gaʹion. * ( Selah ) י [ Yod ] 17 The wicked will retreat toward the Grave, * All the nations who forget God. 18 But the poor will not always be forgotten; + Nor will the hope of the meek ever perish. + כ [ Kaph ] 19 Rise up, O Jehovah! Do not let mortal man prevail. May the nations be judged in your presence. + 20 Strike them with fear, O Jehovah, + Let the nations know that they are only mortal men.
