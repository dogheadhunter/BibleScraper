Psalm 132:1-18 A Song of the Ascents. 132 O Jehovah, remember David And all his suffering; + 2 How he swore to Jehovah, How he vowed to the Powerful One of Jacob: + 3 “I will not go into my tent, my home. + I will not lie upon my couch, my bed; 4 I will not allow my eyes to sleep, Nor my eyelids to slumber 5 Until I find a place for Jehovah, A fine residence * for the Powerful One of Jacob.” + 6 Look! We heard about it in Ephʹra·thah; + We found it in the fields of the forest. + 7 Let us come into his residence; * + Let us bow down at his footstool. + 8 Rise up, O Jehovah, to come to your resting-place, + You and the Ark of your strength. + 9 May your priests be clothed with righteousness, And may your loyal ones shout joyfully. 10 For the sake of David your servant, Do not reject * your anointed one. + 11 Jehovah has sworn to David; He will surely not go back on his word: “One of your offspring, * I will place on your throne. + 12 If your sons keep my covenant And my reminders that I teach them, + Their sons too Will sit on your throne forever.” + 13 For Jehovah has chosen Zion; + He has desired it for his dwelling place: + 14 “This is my resting-place forever; Here I will dwell, + for this is my desire. 15 I will richly bless it with provisions; I will satisfy its poor with bread. + 16 Its priests I will clothe with salvation, + And its loyal ones will shout joyfully. + 17 There I will make the strength * of David grow. I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one. + 18 I will clothe his enemies with shame, But the crown * on his head will flourish.” + Footnotes ^ Or “A grand tabernacle.” ^ Or “his grand tabernacle.” ^ Lit., “turn back the face of.” ^ Lit., “of the fruit of your womb.” ^ Lit., “horn.” ^ Or “diadem.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
