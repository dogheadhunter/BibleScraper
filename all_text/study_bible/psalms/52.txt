Psalm 52:1-9 To the director. Masʹkil. * Of David, when Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite came and told Saul that David had come to the house of A·himʹe·lech. + 52 Why do you boast about your evil acts, you mighty one? + The loyal love of God lasts all day long. + 2 Your tongue, as sharp as a razor, + Schemes harm and works deceitfully. + 3 You love evil more than what is good, Lying more than speaking what is right. ( Selah ) 4 You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue! 5 That is why God will pull you down once and for all; + He will snatch you up and tear you away from your tent; + He will uproot you from the land of the living. + ( Selah ) 6 The righteous ones will see it and be filled with awe, + And they will laugh at him. + 7 “Here is a man who did not make God his refuge, * + But he trusted in his great riches + And relied on * his own evil plots.” * 8 But I will be like a luxuriant olive tree in God’s house; My trust is in God’s loyal love, + forever and ever. 9 I will praise you forever because you have taken action; + In the presence of your loyal ones, I will hope in your name, + for it is good.
