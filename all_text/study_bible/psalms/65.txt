Psalm 65:1-13 To the director. A melody of David. A song. 65 Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion; + We will pay our vows to you. + 2 O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts * will come. + 3 My errors have overwhelmed me, + But you cover over our transgressions. + 4 Happy is the one whom you choose and bring near To reside in your courtyards. + We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house, + Your holy temple. * + 5 You will answer us with awe-inspiring deeds + of righteousness, O God of our salvation; You are the Confidence of all the ends of the earth + And of those distant across the sea. 6 You * firmly established the mountains by your power; You * are clothed with mightiness. + 7 You * calm the raging seas, + The crash of their waves and the turmoil of the nations. + 8 The inhabitants of remote places will be awestruck by your signs; + You will cause those from the sunrise to the sunset to shout joyfully. 9 You care for the earth, Making it abundantly fruitful * and very rich. + The stream from God is full of water; You provide grain for them, + For that is how you prepared the earth. 10 You drench its furrows and level off its plowed soil; * You soften it with showers of rain; you bless its growth. + 11 You crown the year with your goodness; Your tracks overflow with abundance. * + 12 The pastures of the wilderness keep overflowing, * + And the hills are clothed with joyfulness. + 13 The pastures are covered with flocks, And the valleys * are carpeted with grain. + They shout in triumph, yes, they sing. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “all flesh.” ^ Or “sanctuary.” ^ Lit., “He.” ^ Lit., “He.” ^ Lit., “He.” ^ Lit., “making it overflow.” ^ Or “its ridges.” ^ Lit., “drip with fatness.” ^ Lit., “dripping.” ^ Or “low plains.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
