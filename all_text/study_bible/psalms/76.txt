Psalm 76:1-12 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A melody of Aʹsaph. + A song. 76 God is known in Judah; + In Israel his name is great. + 2 His shelter is in Saʹlem, + And his dwelling is in Zion. + 3 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. + ( Selah ) 4 You shine brightly; * You are more majestic than the mountains of prey. 5 The courageous of heart have been plundered. + They have fallen asleep; The warriors were all helpless. + 6 From your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both the charioteer and the horse have fallen fast asleep. + 7 You alone are awe-inspiring. + Who can withstand your intense anger? + 8 From heaven you pronounced judgment; + The earth was afraid and was silent + 9 When God rose up to execute judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. + ( Selah ) 10 For the rage of man will serve to your praise; + With the remnants of their rage you will adorn yourself. 11 Make your vows to Jehovah your God and pay them, + Let all who are around him bring their gift in fear. + 12 He will humble the pride * of leaders; He inspires fear in the kings of the earth.
