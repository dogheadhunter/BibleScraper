Psalm 16:1-11 A mikʹtam * of David. 16 Protect me, O God, for I have taken refuge in you. + 2 I have said to Jehovah: “You are Jehovah, my Source of goodness. 3 And the holy ones in the earth, The majestic ones, bring me great delight.” + 4 Those who pursue other gods multiply their sorrows. + I will never pour out their drink offerings of blood, Nor will my lips mention their names. + 5 Jehovah is my portion, my allotted share, + and my cup. + You safeguard my inheritance. 6 Pleasant places have been measured out to me. Yes, I am content with my inheritance. + 7 I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice. + Even during the night, my innermost thoughts * correct me. + 8 I keep Jehovah before me constantly. + Because he is at my right hand, I will never be shaken. * + 9 So my heart rejoices, my whole being * is joyful. And I reside * in security. 10 For you will not leave me in * the Grave. * + You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit. * + 11 You make known to me the path of life. + In your presence * is abundant joy; + There is happiness * at your right hand forever.
