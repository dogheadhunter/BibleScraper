Psalm 48:1-14 A song. A melody of the sons of Korʹah. + 48 Jehovah is great and most worthy of praise In the city of our God, in his holy mountain. 2 Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, + Is Mount Zion in the far north, The city of the Grand King. + 3 In her fortified towers, God has made known that he is a secure refuge. * + 4 For look! kings have assembled; * Together they have advanced. 5 When they saw it, they were amazed. They panicked and fled in terror. 6 Trembling seized them there, Anguish like that of a woman giving birth. 7 With an east wind you wreck the ships of Tarʹshish. 8 What we heard about, we have now seen for ourselves In the city of Jehovah of armies, in the city of our God. God will firmly establish it forever. + ( Selah ) 9 We ponder your loyal love, O God, + Within your temple. 10 Like your name, O God, your praise Reaches to the ends of the earth. + Your right hand is filled with righteousness. + 11 May Mount Zion + rejoice, May the towns * of Judah be joyful, because of your judgments. + 12 March around Zion; go all around it; Count its towers. + 13 Set your hearts upon its ramparts. * + Inspect its fortified towers, So that you may tell about it to future generations. 14 For this God is our God + forever and ever. He will guide us forevermore. * + Footnotes ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or “met by appointment.” ^ Lit., “daughters.” ^ Or “fortified walls.” ^ Or possibly, “until we die.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
