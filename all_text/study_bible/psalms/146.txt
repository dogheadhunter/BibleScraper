Psalm 146:1-10 146 Praise Jah! * + Let my whole being * praise Jehovah. + 2 I will praise Jehovah all my life. I will sing praises * to my God as long as I live. 3 Do not put your trust in princes * Nor in a son of man, who cannot bring salvation. + 4 His spirit * goes out, he returns to the ground; + On that very day his thoughts perish. + 5 Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob as his helper, + Whose hope is in Jehovah his God, + 6 The Maker of heaven and earth, Of the sea, and of all that is in them, + The One who always remains faithful, + 7 The One securing justice for those defrauded, The One giving bread to the hungry. + Jehovah is releasing the prisoners. * + 8 Jehovah is opening the eyes of the blind; + Jehovah is raising up those bowed down; + Jehovah loves the righteous. 9 Jehovah is protecting the foreign residents; He sustains the fatherless child and the widow, + But he thwarts the plans of the wicked. * + 10 Jehovah will be King forever, + Your God, O Zion, for generation after generation.
