Psalm 90:1-17 A prayer of Moses, the man of the true God. + 90 O Jehovah, you have been our dwelling place * + throughout all generations. 2 Before the mountains were born Or you brought forth * the earth and the productive land, + From everlasting to everlasting, * you are God. + 3 You make mortal man return to dust; You say: “Return, you sons of men.” + 4 For a thousand years are in your eyes just as yesterday when it is past, + Just as a watch during the night. 5 You sweep them away; + they become like mere sleep; In the morning they are like grass that sprouts. + 6 In the morning it blossoms and is renewed, But by evening it withers and dries up. + 7 For we are consumed by your anger + And terrified by your rage. 8 You place our errors in front of you; * + Our secrets are exposed by the light of your face. + 9 Our days ebb * away because of your fury; And our years come to an end like a whisper. * 10 The span of our life is 70 years, Or 80 + if one is especially strong. * But they are filled with trouble and sorrow; They quickly pass by, and away we fly. + 11 Who can fathom the power of your anger? Your fury is as great as the fear you deserve. + 12 Teach us how to count our days + So that we may acquire a heart of wisdom. 13 Return, O Jehovah! + How long will this last? + Have pity on your servants. + 14 Satisfy us with your loyal love + in the morning, So that we may shout joyfully and rejoice + during all our days. 15 Make us rejoice in proportion to the days you have afflicted us, + For as many years as we have experienced calamity. + 16 May your servants see your activity, And may their sons see your splendor. + 17 May the favor of Jehovah our God be upon us; May you prosper * the work of our hands. Yes, prosper * the work of our hands. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “our refuge.” ^ Or “brought forth as with labor pains.” ^ Or “From eternity to eternity.” ^ Or “You are aware of our errors.” ^ Or “Our life ebbs.” ^ Or “a sigh.” ^ Or “because of special mightiness.” ^ Or “firmly establish.” ^ Or “firmly establish.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
