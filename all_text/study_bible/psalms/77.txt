Psalm 77:1-20 To the director; on Je·duʹthun. * Of Aʹsaph. + A melody. 77 With my voice I will cry out to God; To God I will cry out, and he will hear me. + 2 In the day of my distress I search for Jehovah. + At night my hands are stretched out to him without ceasing. * I * cannot be comforted. 3 When I remember God, I groan; + I am troubled and my strength fails. * + ( Selah ) 4 You hold my eyelids open; I am agitated and cannot speak. 5 My thoughts turn to the days of long ago, + The years of the distant past. 6 During the night I remember my song; * + I ponder in my heart; + I make * a diligent search. 7 Will Jehovah cast us off forever? + Will he never again show his favor? + 8 Has his loyal love ceased forever? Will his promise come to nothing for all generations? 9 Has God forgotten to show his favor, + Or has his anger caused his mercy to cease? ( Selah ) 10 Must I keep saying: “This is what distresses me: * + The Most High has changed his position * toward us”? 11 I will remember the works of Jah; I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago. 12 And I will meditate on all your activity And ponder over your dealings. + 13 O God, your ways are holy. What god is as great as you, O God? + 14 You are the true God, who does marvelous things. + You have revealed your strength to the peoples. + 15 With your power * you have rescued * your people, + The sons of Jacob and of Joseph. ( Selah ) 16 The waters saw you, O God; The waters saw you and were disturbed. + And the deep waters became agitated. 17 The clouds poured down water. The cloudy skies thundered, And your arrows flew here and there. + 18 The sound of your thunder + was like chariot wheels; Flashes of lightning lit up the inhabited earth; * + The earth trembled and quaked. + 19 Your way was through the sea, + Your path through many waters; But your footprints could not be traced. 20 You led your people just like a flock, + In the care * of Moses and Aaron. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Lit., “growing numb.” ^ Or “My soul.” ^ Lit., “my spirit faints.” ^ Or “string music.” ^ Lit., “My spirit makes.” ^ Lit., “right hand.” ^ Or “pierces me.” ^ Lit., “arm.” ^ Lit., “redeemed.” ^ Or “the productive land.” ^ Lit., “By the hand.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
