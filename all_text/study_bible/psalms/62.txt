Psalm 62:1-12 To the director; of Je·duʹthun. * A melody of David. 62 Indeed, I wait * silently for God. My salvation comes from him. + 2 Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge; * + I will never be greatly shaken. + 3 How long will you assault a man in order to murder him? + All of you are as dangerous as a leaning wall, a stone wall ready to collapse. * 4 For they consult together to topple him from his high position; * They take pleasure in lying. With their mouth they bless, but inside they are cursing. + ( Selah ) 5 Indeed, I wait silently * for God + Because my hope comes from him. + 6 Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, my secure refuge; I will never be shaken. + 7 Upon God depends my salvation and my glory. My strong rock, my refuge, is God. + 8 Trust in him at all times, O people. Pour out your hearts before him. + God is a refuge for us. + ( Selah ) 9 The sons of men are a mere breath, The sons of mankind are a delusion. + When laid together on the scales, they are lighter than a mere breath. + 10 Do not trust in extortion Or put false hopes in robbery. If your wealth increases, do not set your heart on it. + 11 Once God has spoken, twice I have heard this: That strength belongs to God. + 12 Also loyal love is yours, O Jehovah, + For you repay each one according to his deeds. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “my soul waits.” ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or possibly, “All of you, as if he were a leaning wall, a stone wall ready to collapse.” ^ Or “his dignity.” ^ Or “wait silently, O my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
