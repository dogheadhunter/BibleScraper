Psalm 92:1-15 A melody. A song for the Sabbath day. 92 It is good to give thanks to Jehovah + And to sing praises * to your name, O Most High, 2 To declare your loyal love + in the morning And your faithfulness during the nights, 3 Accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument and a lute, By the melodious sound of a harp. + 4 For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your deeds; Because of the works of your hands I shout joyfully. 5 How great your works are, O Jehovah! + How very deep your thoughts are! + 6 No unreasoning man can know them; And no foolish person can understand this: + 7 When the wicked sprout like weeds * And all the wrongdoers flourish, It is that they may be annihilated forever. + 8 But you are exalted forever, O Jehovah. 9 Indeed, look in triumph on your enemies, O Jehovah, Look at how your enemies will perish; All the wrongdoers will be scattered. + 10 But you will exalt my strength * like that of a wild bull; I will moisten my skin with fresh oil. + 11 My eyes will look in triumph on my foes; + My ears will hear about the downfall of the evil men who attack me. 12 But the righteous will flourish like a palm tree And grow big like a cedar in Lebʹa·non. + 13 They are planted in the house of Jehovah; They flourish in the courtyards of our God. + 14 Even in old age * they will still be thriving; + They will remain vigorous * and fresh, + 15 Declaring that Jehovah is upright. He is my Rock, + in whom there is no unrighteousness.
