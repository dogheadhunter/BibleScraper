Psalm 41:1-13 To the director. A melody of David. 41 Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one; + Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity. 2 Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth; + You will never turn him over to the will * of his enemies. + 3 Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; + During his sickness you will completely change his bed. 4 For I said: “O Jehovah, show me favor. + Heal me, * + for I have sinned against you.” + 5 But my enemies speak evil about me: “When will he die and his name perish?” 6 If one of them comes to see me, his heart speaks falsely. He gathers something harmful to say; Then he goes out and spreads it abroad. 7 All those who hate me whisper to one another; They are scheming something bad against me: 8 “A dreadful thing has overtaken him; Now that he is down, he will not rise again.” + 9 Even the man at peace with me, one whom I trusted, + Who was eating my bread, has lifted his heel against me. * + 10 But you, O Jehovah, show me favor and raise me up, So that I may repay them. 11 By this I will know that you are pleased with me: When my enemy cannot shout in triumph over me. + 12 As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity; + You will keep me in your presence forever. + 13 May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praised Throughout all eternity. * + Amen and Amen.
