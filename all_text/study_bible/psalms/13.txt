Psalm 13:1-6 To the director. A melody of David. 13 How long, O Jehovah, will you forget me? Forever? How long will you hide your face from me? + 2 How long will I * have anxious concern, With grief in my heart each day? How long will my enemy triumph over me? + 3 Look upon me and answer me, O Jehovah my God. Give light to my eyes, so that I may not fall asleep in death, 4 So that my enemy will not say: “I have defeated him!” Do not let my opponents rejoice over my downfall. + 5 As for me, I trust in your loyal love; + My heart will rejoice in your acts of salvation. + 6 I will sing to Jehovah, for he has richly rewarded me. * + Footnotes ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “he has dealt rewardingly with me.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
