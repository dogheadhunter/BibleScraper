Psalm 88:1-18 A song. A melody of the sons of Korʹah. + To the director; in the style of Maʹha·lath, * to be sung alternately. Masʹkil * of Heʹman + the Ezʹra·hite. 88 O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, + By day I cry out, And by night I come before you. + 2 Let my prayer come to you, + Incline your ear * to my cry for help. + 3 For my soul * has been filled with calamity, + And my life is on the brink of the Grave. * + 4 I am already counted among those going down to the pit; * + I have become a helpless man, * + 5 Left among the dead Like the slain lying in a grave, Whom you remember no longer And who have been separated from your care. * 6 You have put me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in a large abyss. 7 Your rage weighs heavily on me, + And you overwhelm me with your crashing waves. ( Selah ) 8 You have driven my acquaintances far away from me; + You have made me something detestable to them. I am trapped and cannot escape. 9 My eye is worn out because of my affliction. + I call on you, O Jehovah, all day long; + To you I spread out my hands. 10 Will you perform wonders for the dead? Can those powerless in death rise up to praise you? + ( Selah ) 11 Will your loyal love be declared in the grave, Your faithfulness in the place of destruction? * 12 Will your wonders be known in the darkness Or your righteousness in the land of oblivion? + 13 But I still cry to you for help, O Jehovah, + Each morning my prayer comes before you. + 14 Why, O Jehovah, do you reject me? * + Why do you hide your face from me? + 15 From my youth on, I have been afflicted and ready to perish; + I am numb from the terrible things you allow me to suffer. 16 Your burning anger overwhelms me; + Your terrors destroy me. 17 They surround me like waters all day long; They close in on me from all sides. * 18 You have driven my friends and companions far away from me; + Darkness has become my companion.
