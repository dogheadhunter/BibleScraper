Psalm 147:1-20 147 Praise Jah! * It is good to sing praises * to our God; How pleasant and fitting it is to praise him! + 2 Jehovah is building Jerusalem; + He gathers together the dispersed ones of Israel. + 3 He heals the brokenhearted; He binds up their wounds. 4 He counts the number of the stars; He calls all of them by name. + 5 Our Lord is great and is mighty in power; + His understanding is beyond measure. + 6 Jehovah raises up the meek, + But he hurls the wicked to the ground. 7 Sing to Jehovah with thanksgiving; Sing praises to our God, accompanied by the harp, 8 The One who covers the heavens with clouds, The One providing rain for the earth, + The One making grass sprout + on the mountains. 9 To the animals he gives food, + To the young ravens that call out for it. + 10 He does not delight in the power of the horse; + Nor is he impressed by the strong legs of a man. + 11 Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him, + In those waiting for his loyal love. + 12 Glorify Jehovah, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion. 13 He makes the bars of your city gates strong; He blesses your sons within you. 14 He brings peace to your territory; + He satisfies you with the finest * wheat. + 15 He sends his command to the earth; His word runs swiftly. 16 He sends the snow like wool; + He scatters the frost just like ashes. + 17 He hurls down his hailstones * like morsels of bread. + Who can withstand his cold? + 18 He sends out his word, and they melt. He makes his wind blow, + and the waters flow. 19 He declares his word to Jacob, His regulations and judgments to Israel. + 20 He has not done so with any other nation; + They know nothing about his judgments. Praise Jah! * + Footnotes ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Or “make music.” ^ Lit., “the fat of.” ^ Or “ice.” ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah.
