Psalm 31:1-24 To the director. A melody of David. 31 In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge. + May I never be put to shame. + Rescue me because of your righteousness. + 2 Incline your ear * to me. Come quickly to my rescue. + Become for me a mountain stronghold, A fortified place to save me. + 3 For you are my crag and my stronghold; + For the sake of your name, + you will lead me and guide me. + 4 You will free me from the net that they have secretly laid for me, + For you are my fortress. + 5 Into your hand I entrust my spirit. + You have redeemed me, O Jehovah, the God of truth. * + 6 I hate those who are devoted to worthless, vain idols, But as for me, I trust in Jehovah. 7 I will rejoice greatly in your loyal love, For you have seen my affliction; + You are aware of my deep distress. * 8 You have not handed me over to the enemy, But you make me stand in a place of safety. * 9 Show me favor, O Jehovah, for I am in distress. Anguish has made my eyes weak, + my whole body * as well. + 10 My life is consumed with grief + And my years with groaning. + My strength is waning because of my error; My bones grow weak. + 11 I am scorned by all my adversaries, + Especially my neighbors. And I am dreaded by my acquaintances; When they see me in public, they flee from me. + 12 I am put out of their heart * and forgotten, as if I were dead; I am like a broken jar. 13 I have heard many evil rumors; Terror surrounds me. + When they gather together as one against me, They scheme to take away my life. * + 14 But I trust in you, O Jehovah. + I declare: “You are my God.” + 15 My days * are in your hand. Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me. + 16 Make your face shine upon your servant. + Save me by your loyal love. 17 O Jehovah, may I not be put to shame when I call on you. + May the wicked be put to shame; + May they be silenced in the Grave. * + 18 May lying lips become speechless, + Lips that speak arrogantly against the righteous, with haughtiness and contempt. 19 How abundant your goodness is! + You have stored it up for those who fear you, + And you have shown it before all men, in behalf of those taking refuge in you. + 20 You will conceal them in the secret place of your presence + From the schemes of men; You will hide them in your shelter From malicious attacks. * + 21 May Jehovah be praised, For in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me + in a besieged city. + 22 As for me, I panicked and said: “I will perish from before you.” + But you heard my pleas for help when I cried out to you. + 23 Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him! + Jehovah protects the faithful, + But he repays exceedingly anyone showing haughtiness. + 24 Be courageous, and may your heart be strong, + All you who are waiting for Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “Bend down and listen.” ^ Or “the faithful God.” ^ Or “the distresses of my soul.” ^ Or “a roomy place.” ^ Or “my soul and my belly.” ^ Or “mind.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “times.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
