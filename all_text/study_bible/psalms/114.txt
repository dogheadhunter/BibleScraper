Psalm 114:1-8 114 When Israel went out of Egypt, + The house of Jacob from a people speaking a foreign language, 2 Judah became his sanctuary, * Israel, his dominion. + 3 The sea saw it and fled; + The Jordan turned back. + 4 The mountains skipped about like rams, + The hills, like lambs. 5 What made you flee, O sea? + Why, O Jordan, did you turn back? + 6 Why did you skip about like rams, O mountains, Like lambs, O hills? 7 Tremble, O earth, because of the Lord, Because of the God of Jacob, + 8 Who turns the rock into a reedy pool of water, The flinty rock into springs of water. + Footnotes ^ Or “holy place.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
