Psalm 108:1-13 A song. A melody of David. 108 My heart is steadfast, O God. I will sing and make music with my whole being. * + 2 Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp. + I will awaken the dawn. 3 I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah, And I will sing praises * to you among the nations. 4 For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens, + And your faithfulness, up to the skies. 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God; May your glory be over all the earth. + 6 So that your loved ones may be rescued, Save us with your right hand and answer me. + 7 God has spoken in his holiness: * “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem + as an inheritance, And I will measure off the Valley * of Sucʹcoth. + 8 Gilʹe·ad + belongs to me, as does Ma·nasʹseh, And Eʹphra·im is the helmet * for my head; + Judah is my commander’s staff. + 9 Moʹab is my washbasin. + Over Eʹdom I will throw my sandal. + Over Phi·lisʹti·a I will shout in triumph.” + 10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Eʹdom? + 11 Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us, Our God, who no longer goes out with our armies? + 12 Help us in our distress, + For salvation by humans is worthless. + 13 By God we will gain power, + And he will trample on our adversaries. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “even my glory.” ^ Or “make music.” ^ Or possibly, “in his holy place.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Lit., “stronghold.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
