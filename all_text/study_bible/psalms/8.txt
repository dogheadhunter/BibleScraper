Psalm 8:1-9 To the director; upon the Gitʹtith. * A melody of David. 8 O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth; You have set your splendor even higher than the heavens! * + 2 Out of the mouth of children and infants + you have established strength On account of your adversaries, To silence the enemy and the avenger. 3 When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, The moon and the stars that you have prepared, + 4 What is mortal man that you keep him in mind, And a son of man that you take care of him? + 5 You made him a little lower than godlike ones, * And you crowned him with glory and splendor. 6 You gave him dominion over the works of your hands; + You have put everything under his feet: 7 All the flocks and cattle, As well as the wild animals, * + 8 The birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, Whatever passes through the paths of the seas. 9 O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is throughout the earth!
