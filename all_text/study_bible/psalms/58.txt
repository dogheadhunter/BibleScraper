Psalm 58:1-11 To the director; set to “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of David. Mikʹtam. * 58 Can you speak about righteousness when you are silent? + Can you judge in uprightness, you sons of men? + 2 Instead, you devise unrighteousness in your heart, + And your hands dispense violence in the land. + 3 The wicked go astray * from birth; * They are wayward, liars from the time they are born. 4 Their venom is like the venom of serpents; + They are deaf like the cobra that stops up its ear. 5 It will not listen to the voice of charmers, No matter how skillful their spells. 6 O God, knock the teeth out of their mouth! Break the jaws of these lions, * O Jehovah! 7 May they disappear like waters that drain away. May He bend his bow and make them fall by his arrows. 8 May they be like a snail that melts away as it moves along; Like a woman’s stillborn child who never sees the sun. 9 Before your cooking pots feel the heat of the bramble, He will sweep away both the moist and the burning twig, as in a storm wind. + 10 The righteous one will rejoice because he has seen the vengeance; + His feet will be drenched with the blood of the wicked. + 11 Then men will say: “Surely there is a reward for the righteous. + There is indeed a God who judges in the earth.” + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “are corrupt.” ^ Lit., “from the womb.” ^ Or “maned young lions.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
