Psalm 94:1-23 94 O God of vengeance, Jehovah, + O God of vengeance, shine forth! 2 Rise up, O Judge of the earth. + Repay to the haughty what they deserve. + 3 How long will the wicked, O Jehovah, How long will the wicked continue to exult? + 4 They babble and speak arrogantly; All the wrongdoers brag about themselves. 5 They crush your people, O Jehovah, + And oppress your inheritance. 6 They kill the widow and the foreign resident, And they murder the fatherless children. 7 They say: “Jah does not see; + The God of Jacob does not take notice of it.” + 8 Understand this, you who are unreasoning; You foolish ones, when will you ever show insight? + 9 The One who made * the ear, can he not hear? The One who formed the eye, can he not see? + 10 The One correcting the nations, can he not reprove? + He is the One who imparts knowledge to people! + 11 Jehovah knows the thoughts of men, That they are but a mere breath. + 12 Happy is the man whom you correct, O Jah, + Whom you teach from your law, + 13 To give him tranquility during days of calamity, Until a pit is dug for the wicked. + 14 For Jehovah will not forsake his people, + Nor will he abandon his inheritance. + 15 For judgment will once again be righteous, And all the upright in heart will follow it. 16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against the wrongdoers? 17 If Jehovah had not been my helper, I * would soon have perished. * + 18 When I said: “My foot is slipping,” Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me. + 19 When anxieties * overwhelmed me, * You comforted and soothed me. * + 20 Can a throne * of corruption be allied with you While it is framing trouble in the name of the law? * + 21 They make vicious attacks on the righteous one * + And condemn the innocent one to death. * + 22 But Jehovah will become a secure refuge * for me, My God is my rock of refuge. + 23 He will make their wicked deeds come back upon them. + He will do away with * them by means of their own evil. Jehovah our God will do away with * them. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “planted.” ^ Lit., “resided in silence.” ^ Or “My soul.” ^ Or “disquieting thoughts.” ^ Or “became many inside of me.” ^ Or “Your consolations soothed my soul.” ^ Or “rulers; judges.” ^ Or “by decree.” ^ Lit., “And the blood of the innocent they declare guilty (wicked).” ^ Or “the soul of the righteous one.” ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Lit., “will silence.” ^ Lit., “will silence.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
