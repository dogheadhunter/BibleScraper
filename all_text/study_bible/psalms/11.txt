Psalm 11:1-7 To the director. Of David. 11 In Jehovah I have taken refuge. + So how can you say to me: * “Flee like a bird to your mountain! 2 See how the wicked bend the bow; They set their arrow on the bowstring, To shoot from the darkness those upright in heart. 3 When the foundations * are torn down, What can the righteous do?” 4 Jehovah is in his holy temple. + Jehovah’s throne is in the heavens. + His own eyes see, his watchful * eyes examine the sons of men. + 5 Jehovah examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one; + He * hates anyone who loves violence. + 6 Upon the wicked, he will rain down snares; * Fire and sulfur + and a scorching wind will be the portion of their cup. 7 For Jehovah is righteous; + he loves righteous acts. + The upright will see his face. * + Footnotes ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “the foundations of justice.” ^ Or “beaming.” ^ Or “His soul; His very being.” ^ Or possibly, “burning coals.” ^ Or “experience his favor.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
