Psalm 91:1-16 91 Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High + Will lodge under the shadow of the Almighty. + 2 I will say to Jehovah: “You are my refuge and my stronghold, + My God in whom I trust.” + 3 For he will rescue you from the trap of the birdcatcher, From the destructive pestilence. 4 With his pinions he will cover * you, And under his wings you will take refuge. + His faithfulness + will be a large shield + and a protective wall. * 5 You will not fear the terrors of the night, + Nor the arrow that flies by day, + 6 Nor the pestilence that stalks in the gloom, Nor the destruction that ravages at midday. 7 A thousand will fall at your side And ten thousand at your right hand, But to you it will not come near. + 8 You will only see it with your eyes As you witness the punishment * of the wicked. 9 Because you said: “Jehovah is my refuge,” You have made the Most High your dwelling; * + 10 No disaster will befall you, + And no plague will come near your tent. 11 For he will give his angels + a command concerning you, To guard you in all your ways. + 12 They will carry you on their hands, + So that you may not strike your foot against a stone. + 13 On the young lion and the cobra you will tread; You will trample underfoot the maned lion and the big snake. + 14 God said: “Because he has affection for me, * I will rescue him. + I will protect him because he knows * my name. + 15 He will call on me, and I will answer him. + I will be with him in distress. + I will rescue him and glorify him. 16 I will satisfy him with long life, + And I will cause him to see my acts of salvation.” * + Footnotes ^ Or “block approach to.” ^ Or “a bulwark.” ^ Lit., “retribution.” ^ Or possibly, “fortress; refuge.” ^ Lit., “he has joined himself to me.” ^ Or “acknowledges.” ^ Or “see salvation from me.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
