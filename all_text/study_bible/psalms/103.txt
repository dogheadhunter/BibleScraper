Psalm 103:1-22 Of David. 103 Let me * praise Jehovah; Let everything within me praise his holy name. 2 Let me * praise Jehovah; May I never forget all that he has done. + 3 He forgives all your errors + And heals all your ailments; + 4 He reclaims your life from the pit * + And crowns you with his loyal love and mercy. + 5 He satisfies you with good things + all your life, So that your youth is renewed like that of an eagle. + 6 Jehovah acts with righteousness + and justice For all who are oppressed. + 7 He made known his ways to Moses, + His deeds to the sons of Israel. + 8 Jehovah is merciful and compassionate, * + Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love. * + 9 He will not always find fault, + Nor will he stay resentful forever. + 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, + Nor has he repaid us what our errors deserve. + 11 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So great is his loyal love toward those who fear him. + 12 As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset, So far off from us he has put our transgressions. + 13 As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him. + 14 For he well knows how we are formed, + Remembering that we are dust. + 15 As for mortal man, his days are like those of grass; + He blooms like a blossom of the field. + 16 But when a wind blows, it is no more, As though it was never there. * 17 But the loyal love of Jehovah is for all eternity * Toward those who fear him, + And his righteousness toward their children’s children, + 18 Toward those who keep his covenant + And those who are careful to observe his orders. 19 Jehovah has firmly established his throne in the heavens; + And his kingship rules over everything. + 20 Praise Jehovah, all you his angels, + mighty in power, Who carry out his word, + obeying his voice. * 21 Praise Jehovah, all his armies, + His ministers who do his will. + 22 Praise Jehovah, all his works, In all the places where he rules. * Let my whole being * praise Jehovah.
