Psalm 115:1-18 115 Not to us, O Jehovah, not to us, * But to your name give glory + Because of your loyal love and your faithfulness. + 2 Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?” + 3 Our God is in the heavens; He does whatever he pleases. 4 Their idols are silver and gold, The work of human hands. + 5 A mouth they have, but they cannot speak; + Eyes, but they cannot see; 6 Ears they have, but they cannot hear; A nose, but they cannot smell; 7 Hands they have, but they cannot feel; Feet, but they cannot walk; + They make no sound with their throat. + 8 The people who make them will become just like them, + As will all those who trust in them. + 9 O Israel, trust in Jehovah + —He is their help and their shield. + 10 O house of Aaron, + trust in Jehovah —He is their help and their shield. 11 You who fear Jehovah, trust in Jehovah + —He is their help and their shield. + 12 Jehovah remembers us and will bless; He will bless the house of Israel; + He will bless the house of Aaron. 13 He will bless those who fear Jehovah, The small as well as the great. 14 Jehovah will give you an increase, To you and your children. * + 15 May you be blessed by Jehovah, + The Maker of heaven and earth. + 16 As for the heavens, they belong to Jehovah, + But the earth he has given to the sons of men. + 17 The dead do not praise Jah; + Nor do any who go down into the silence of death. * + 18 But we will praise Jah From now on and forever. Praise Jah! * Footnotes ^ Or “To us belongs nothing, O ­Jehovah, to us belongs nothing.” ^ Lit., “sons.” ^ Lit., “into silence.” ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah.
