Psalm 63:1-11 A melody of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. + 63 O God, you are my God, I keep looking for you. + I do thirst * for you. + I am * faint with longing for you In a dry and parched land, where there is no water. + 2 So I have looked upon you in the holy place; I have seen your strength and your glory. + 3 Because your loyal love is better than life, + My own lips will glorify you. + 4 Thus I will praise you all my life; In your name I will lift up my hands. 5 I am * satisfied with the best and choicest portion, * So my mouth will praise you with joy on my lips. + 6 I remember you while upon my bed; I meditate on you during the watches of the night. + 7 For you are my helper, + And I shout joyfully in the shadow of your wings. + 8 I cling * to you; Your right hand keeps fast hold on me. + 9 But those who seek to destroy my life * Will descend into the depths of the earth. 10 They will be handed over to the power of the sword; They will become food for jackals. * 11 But the king will rejoice in God. Every person swearing by Him will exult, * For the mouth of those speaking lies will be silenced.
