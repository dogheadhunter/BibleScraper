Psalm 99:1-9 99 Jehovah has become King. + Let the peoples tremble. He sits enthroned above * the cherubs. + Let the earth shake. 2 Jehovah is great in Zion, And he is high over all the peoples. + 3 Let them praise your great name, + For it is awe-inspiring and holy. 4 He is a mighty king who loves justice. + You have firmly established what is upright. You have brought about justice and righteousness + in Jacob. 5 Exalt Jehovah our God + and bow down * at his footstool; + He is holy. + 6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, + And Samuel was among those calling on his name. + They would call to Jehovah, And he would answer them. + 7 He would speak to them from the pillar of cloud. + They kept his reminders and the decree that he gave to them. + 8 O Jehovah our God, you answered them. + You were a God who pardoned them, + But you punished * them for their sinful deeds. + 9 Exalt Jehovah our God + And bow down * before his holy mountain, + For Jehovah our God is holy. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “between.” ^ Or “worship.” ^ Lit., “executed vengeance against.” ^ Or “worship.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
