Psalm 66:1-20 To the director. A song. A melody. 66 Shout in triumph to God, all the earth. + 2 Sing praises * to his glorious name. Make his praise glorious. + 3 Say to God: “How awe-inspiring your works are! + Because of your great power, Your enemies will cringe before you. + 4 All the earth will bow down to you; + They will sing praises to you; They will sing praises to your name.” + ( Selah ) 5 Come and see the works of God. His deeds toward the sons of men are awe-inspiring. + 6 He changed the sea into dry land; + They crossed the river on foot. + There we rejoiced in him. + 7 He rules forever + by his might. His eyes keep watch on the nations. + Those who are stubborn should not exalt themselves. + ( Selah ) 8 Praise our God, you peoples, + And let the sound of his praise be heard. 9 He preserves us alive; * + He does not allow our feet to stumble. * + 10 For you have examined us, O God; + As silver is refined, so you have refined us. 11 You brought us into a hunting net; You put a crushing burden upon us. * 12 You allowed mortal man to ride over us; * We came through fire and through water; Then you brought us to a place of relief. 13 I will come into your house with whole burnt offerings; + I will pay my vows to you + 14 That my lips promised + And my mouth spoke when I was in distress. 15 I will offer burnt offerings of fattened animals to you With the smoke of sacrificial rams. I will offer bulls along with male goats. ( Selah ) 16 Come and listen, all you who fear God, And I will tell you what he has done for me. * + 17 I called to him with my mouth And glorified him with my tongue. 18 If I had harbored anything hurtful in my heart, Jehovah would not have heard me. + 19 But God did hear; + He paid attention to my prayer. + 20 Praise to God, who did not reject my prayer Or withhold his loyal love from me.
