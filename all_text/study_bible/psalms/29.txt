Psalm 29:1-11 A melody of David. 29 Give Jehovah his due, you sons of mighty ones, Give Jehovah his due for his glory and strength. + 2 Give Jehovah the glory due his name. Bow down to * Jehovah in holy adornment. * 3 The voice of Jehovah is heard over the waters; The glorious God thunders. + Jehovah is over many waters. + 4 The voice of Jehovah is powerful; + The voice of Jehovah is splendid. 5 The voice of Jehovah is breaking the cedars; Yes, Jehovah shatters the cedars of Lebʹa·non. + 6 He makes Lebʹa·non * skip like a calf, And Sirʹi·on + like a young wild bull. 7 The voice of Jehovah strikes with flames of fire; + 8 The voice of Jehovah makes the wilderness shudder; + Jehovah makes the wilderness of Kaʹdesh + shudder. 9 The voice of Jehovah makes the deer shudder and give birth And strips bare the forests. + And all in his temple say: “Glory!” 10 Jehovah sits enthroned above the flooding waters; * + Jehovah sits enthroned as King forever. + 11 Jehovah will give strength to his people. + Jehovah will bless his people with peace. + Footnotes ^ Or “Worship.” ^ Or possibly, “because of the splendor of his holiness.” ^ Evidently, the Lebanon mountain range. ^ Or “the heavenly ocean.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
