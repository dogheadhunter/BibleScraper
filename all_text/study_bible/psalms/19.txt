Psalm 19:1-14 To the director. A melody of David. 19 The heavens are declaring the glory of God; + The skies above * proclaim the work of his hands. + 2 Day after day their speech bubbles forth, And night after night they reveal knowledge. 3 There is no speech, and there are no words; Their voice is not heard. 4 But into all the earth their sound * has gone out, And to the ends of the inhabited earth * their message. + In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun; 5 It is like a bridegroom emerging from the bridal chamber; It rejoices like a mighty man running his course. 6 It emerges from one end of the heavens, And it circles to their other end; + And nothing is concealed from its heat. 7 The law of Jehovah is perfect, + restoring strength. * + The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, + making the inexperienced one wise. + 8 The orders from Jehovah are righteous, causing the heart to rejoice; + The commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine. + 9 The fear of Jehovah + is pure, lasting forever. The judgments of Jehovah are true, altogether righteous. + 10 They are more desirable than gold, Than much fine * gold, + And sweeter than honey, + the honey that drips from the combs. 11 By them your servant has been warned; + In keeping them, there is a large reward. + 12 Who can discern mistakes? + Pronounce me innocent from sins I am unaware of. 13 And hold your servant back from presumptuous acts; + Do not let them dominate me. + Then I will be complete, + And innocent of blatant sins. * 14 May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be pleasing to you, + O Jehovah, my Rock + and my Redeemer. + Footnotes ^ Or “expanse.” ^ Or possibly, “measuring line.” ^ Or “productive land.” ^ Or “restoring (bringing back) the soul.” ^ Or “refined.” ^ Or “much transgression.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
