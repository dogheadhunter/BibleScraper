Psalm 118:1-29 118 Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; + His loyal love endures forever. 2 Let Israel now say: “His loyal love endures forever.” 3 Let those of the house of Aaron now say: “His loyal love endures forever.” 4 Let those fearing Jehovah now say: “His loyal love endures forever.” 5 I called on Jah * in my distress; Jah answered and brought me into a place of safety. * + 6 Jehovah is on my side; I will not be afraid. + What can man do to me? + 7 Jehovah is on my side as my helper; * + I will look in triumph on those who hate me. + 8 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to trust in humans. + 9 It is better to take refuge in Jehovah Than to trust in princes. + 10 All the nations surrounded me, But in the name of Jehovah, I warded them off. + 11 They surrounded me, yes, I was completely surrounded, But in the name of Jehovah, I warded them off. 12 They surrounded me like bees, But they were extinguished as quickly as a fire among thorns. In the name of Jehovah, I warded them off. + 13 I was pushed hard * to make me fall, But Jehovah helped me. 14 Jah is my shelter and my strength, And he has become my salvation. + 15 The sound of rejoicing and salvation * Is in the tents of the righteous. The right hand of Jehovah is demonstrating its power. + 16 The right hand of Jehovah is exalting itself; The right hand of Jehovah is demonstrating its power. + 17 I will not die, no, I will live, In order to declare the works of Jah. + 18 Jah disciplined me severely, + But he did not hand me over to death. + 19 Open to me the gates of righteousness; + I will enter them and praise Jah. 20 This is the gate of Jehovah. The righteous will enter through it. + 21 I will praise you, for you answered me + And you became my salvation. 22 The stone that the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. * + 23 This has come from Jehovah; + It is wonderful in our eyes. + 24 This is the day that Jehovah has made; We will be joyful and rejoice in it. 25 Jehovah, save us, please, we beg! Jehovah, grant us victory, please! 26 Blessed is the one who comes in the name of Jehovah; + We bless you from the house of Jehovah. 27 Jehovah is God; He gives us light. + Join in the festival procession with branches in hand, + Up to the horns of the altar. + 28 You are my God, and I will praise you; My God, I will exalt you. + 29 Give thanks to Jehovah, + for he is good; His loyal love endures forever. + Footnotes ^ “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Or “a roomy place.” ^ Or possibly, “along with those helping me.” ^ Or possibly, “You pushed me hard.” ^ Or “victory.” ^ Lit., “the head of the corner.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
