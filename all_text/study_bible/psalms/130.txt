Psalm 130:1-8 A Song of the Ascents. 130 From the depths I call to you, O Jehovah. + 2 O Jehovah, hear my voice. May your ears pay attention to my pleas for help. 3 If errors were what you watch, * O Jah, * Then who, O Jehovah, could stand? + 4 For with you there is true forgiveness, + So that you may be held in awe. * + 5 I hope in Jehovah, my whole being * hopes in him; I wait for his word. 6 I eagerly wait * for Jehovah, + More than watchmen wait for the morning, + Yes, more than watchmen wait for the morning. 7 Let Israel keep waiting for Jehovah, For Jehovah is loyal in his love, + And he has great power to redeem. 8 He will redeem Israel from all their errors.
