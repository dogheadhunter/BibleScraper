Psalm 144:1-15 Of David. 144 May Jehovah, my Rock, + be praised, Who trains my hands for battle, My fingers for warfare. + 2 He is my loyal love and my stronghold, My secure refuge * and my rescuer, My shield and the One in whom I have taken shelter, + The One subduing peoples under me. + 3 O Jehovah, what is man that you should notice him, The son of mortal man that you should pay attention to him? + 4 Man resembles a mere breath; + His days are like a passing shadow. + 5 O Jehovah, lower * your heavens and descend; + Touch the mountains and make them smoke. + 6 Make lightning flash and scatter the enemy; + Shoot your arrows and throw them into confusion. + 7 Stretch out your hands from above; Rescue me and save me from the surging waters, From the hand * of the foreigners, + 8 Whose mouths speak lies And who raise their right hand to swear to what is false. * 9 O God, I will sing to you a new song. + I will sing praises * to you, accompanied by a ten-stringed instrument, 10 To the One who gives victory * to kings, + The One rescuing his servant David from the deadly sword. + 11 Rescue me and save me from the hand of the foreigners, Whose mouths speak lies And who raise their right hand to swear to what is false. 12 Then our sons will be like young plants that grow up quickly, Our daughters like corner pillars carved for a palace. 13 Our storehouses will overflow with every kind of produce; Our flocks in our fields will multiply by the thousands, by the tens of thousands. 14 Our cattle, heavy with young, will suffer no mishap * or miscarriage; There will be no cry of distress in our public squares. 15 Happy is the people for whom it is this way! Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah! + Footnotes ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or “bend.” ^ Or “grip.” ^ Lit., “And their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.” ^ Or “make music.” ^ Or “salvation.” ^ Or “rupture.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
