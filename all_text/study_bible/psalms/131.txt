Psalm 131:1-3 A Song of the Ascents. Of David. 131 O Jehovah, my heart is not haughty, Nor are my eyes lofty; + Nor do I aspire to things too great, + Or to things that are beyond me. 2 No, but I have calmed and quieted my soul * + Like a weaned child with its mother; I am * contented like a weaned child. 3 Let Israel wait for Jehovah + From now on and forever.
