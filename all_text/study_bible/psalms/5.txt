Psalm 5:1-12 To the director for Neʹhi·loth. * A melody of David. 5 Listen to my words, O Jehovah; + Be attentive to my sighing. 2 Pay attention to my cry for help, O my King and my God, because to you I pray. 3 O Jehovah, you will hear my voice in the morning; + In the morning I will express my concern to you + and wait expectantly. 4 For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness; + No one bad may remain with you. + 5 No arrogant person may stand in your presence. You hate all those who behave wickedly; + 6 You will destroy those who speak lies. + Jehovah detests violent and deceptive people. * + 7 But I will come into your house + because of your great loyal love; + I will bow down toward your holy temple * in reverential fear of you. + 8 Lead me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of my foes; Make your way clear for me. + 9 For nothing they say can be trusted; Within them is nothing but malice; Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue. * + 10 But God will declare them guilty; Their own schemes will cause their downfall. + May they be driven away because of their many transgressions, For they have rebelled against you. 11 But all those who take refuge in you will rejoice; + They will always shout joyfully. You will block approach to them, And those loving your name will rejoice in you. 12 For you will bless anyone righteous, O Jehovah; You will surround them with approval as with a large shield. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “a man of bloodshed and deception.” ^ Or “sanctuary.” ^ Or “They use a smooth tongue.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
