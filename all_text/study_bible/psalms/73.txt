Psalm 73:1-28 A melody of Aʹsaph. + 73 God is truly good to Israel, to those pure in heart. + 2 As for me, my feet had almost strayed; My steps had nearly slipped. + 3 For I became envious of the arrogant * When I would see the peace of the wicked. + 4 For they have no pain in their death; Their bodies are healthy. * + 5 They are not troubled like other humans, + Nor do they suffer like other men. + 6 Therefore, haughtiness is their necklace; + Violence clothes them as a garment. 7 Their prosperity * makes their eyes bulge; They have exceeded the imaginations of the heart. 8 They scoff and say evil things. + They arrogantly threaten oppression. + 9 They speak as if they were as high as heaven, And their tongues swagger about in the earth. 10 So his people turn aside to them, And they drink from their abundant water. 11 They say: “How does God know? + Does the Most High really have knowledge?” 12 Yes, these are the wicked, who always have it easy. + They keep increasing their wealth. + 13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure And washed my hands in innocence. + 14 And I was troubled all day long; + Every morning I was chastised. + 15 But if I had said these things, I would have betrayed your people. * 16 When I tried to understand it, It was troubling to me 17 Until I entered the grand sanctuary of God, And I discerned their future. 18 Surely you place them on slippery ground. + You make them fall to their ruin. + 19 How suddenly they are devastated! + How sudden is their finish as they come to a terrible end! 20 Like a dream when one wakes up, O Jehovah, When you rouse yourself, you will dismiss * their image. 21 But my heart was sour, + And deep inside * I felt sharp pain. 22 I was unreasoning and lacked understanding; I was like a senseless beast before you. 23 But now I am continually with you; You have taken hold of my right hand. + 24 You guide me with your advice, + And afterward you will lead me to glory. + 25 Whom do I have in the heavens? And besides you I desire nothing on earth. + 26 My body and my heart may fail, But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever. + 27 Truly, those keeping far from you will perish. You will put an end to * everyone who immorally * leaves you. + 28 But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me. + I have made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge, To declare all your works. + Footnotes ^ Or “boasters.” ^ Or “Their paunch is fat.” ^ Lit., “fat.” ^ Lit., “the generation of your sons.” ^ Lit., “despise.” ^ Lit., “in my kidneys.” ^ Lit., “silence.” ^ Or “unfaithfully.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
