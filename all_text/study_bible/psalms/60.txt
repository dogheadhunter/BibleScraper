Psalm 60:1-12 To the director; set to “The Lily of Reminder.” Mikʹtam. * Of David. For teaching. When he fought with Aʹram-na·ha·raʹim and Aʹram-Zoʹbah, and Joʹab returned and struck down 12,000 Eʹdom·ites in the Valley of Salt. + 60 O God, you rejected us; you broke through our defenses. + You were angry with us; but now accept us back! 2 You caused the earth to quake; you split it open. Repair its breaches, for it is falling. 3 You caused your people to suffer hardship. You made us drink wine that makes us stagger. + 4 Give * a signal to those fearing you To flee and dodge the bow. ( Selah ) 5 So that your loved ones may be rescued, Save us with your right hand and answer us. + 6 God has spoken in his holiness: * “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem as an inheritance, + And I will measure off the Valley * of Sucʹcoth. + 7 Gilʹe·ad belongs to me, as does Ma·nasʹseh, + And Eʹphra·im is the helmet * for my head; Judah is my commander’s staff. + 8 Moʹab is my washbasin. + Over Eʹdom I will throw my sandal. + Over Phi·lisʹti·a I will shout in triumph.” + 9 Who will bring me to the besieged * city? Who will lead me as far as Eʹdom? + 10 Is it not you, O God, who have rejected us, Our God, who no longer goes out with our armies? + 11 Help us in our distress, For salvation by humans is worthless. + 12 By God we will gain power, + And he will trample on our adversaries. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or possibly, “You have given.” ^ Or possibly, “in his holy place.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Lit., “stronghold.” ^ Or possibly, “fortified.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
