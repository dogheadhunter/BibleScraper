Psalm 124:1-8 A Song of the Ascents. Of David. 124 “If Jehovah had not been with us” + —Let Israel now say— 2 “If Jehovah had not been with us + When men rose up to attack us, + 3 Then they would have swallowed us up alive + When their anger was burning against us. + 4 Then the waters would have washed us away, The torrent would have swept over us. * + 5 The raging waters would have overwhelmed us. * 6 May Jehovah be praised, For he has not given us as prey to their teeth. 7 We are * like a bird that escaped From the hunter’s trap; + The trap was broken, And we escaped. + 8 Our help is in the name of Jehovah, + The Maker of heaven and earth.” Footnotes ^ Or “our soul.” ^ Or “our soul.” ^ Or “Our soul is.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
