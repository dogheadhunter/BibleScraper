Psalm 6:1-10 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments tuned to Shemʹi·nith. * A melody of David. 6 O Jehovah, do not reprove me in your anger, And do not correct me in your rage. + 2 Show me favor, * O Jehovah, for I am growing weak. Heal me, O Jehovah, + for my bones are shaking. 3 Yes, I am * greatly disturbed, + And I ask you, O Jehovah—how long will it be? + 4 Return, O Jehovah, and rescue me; * + Save me for the sake of your loyal love. + 5 For in death there is no mention * of you; In the Grave, * who will praise you? + 6 I have grown weary with my sighing; + All night long I soak my bed with tears; * I flood my couch with weeping. + 7 My eye is weak from my grief; + It has dimmed * because of all those harassing me. 8 Get away from me, all you who behave wickedly, For Jehovah will hear the sound of my weeping. + 9 Jehovah will hear my request for favor; + Jehovah will accept my prayer. 10 All my enemies will be put to shame and dismayed; They will fall back in sudden disgrace. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “mercy.” ^ Or “my soul is.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “remembrance.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
