Psalm 26:1-12 Of David. 26 Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in my integrity; + In Jehovah I have trusted without wavering. + 2 Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; Refine my innermost thoughts * and my heart. + 3 For your loyal love is always in front of me, And I walk in your truth. + 4 I do not associate * with deceitful men, + And I avoid those who hide what they are. * 5 I hate the company of evil men, + And I refuse to associate * with the wicked. + 6 I will wash my hands in innocence, And I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, 7 To cause the sound of thanksgiving to be heard + And to declare all your wonderful works. 8 Jehovah, I love the house where you dwell, + The place where your glory resides. + 9 Do not sweep me * away with sinners + Nor take my life away with violent men, * 10 Whose hands engage in shameful conduct, And whose right hand is full of bribes. 11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity. Rescue * me and show me favor. 12 My foot is standing on level ground; + In the great congregation, * I will praise Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “my deepest emotions.” Lit., “my kidneys.” ^ Lit., “sit.” ^ Or “I do not mingle with hypocrites.” ^ Lit., “sit.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “with men of bloodshed.” ^ Lit., “Redeem.” ^ Lit., “In assemblies.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
