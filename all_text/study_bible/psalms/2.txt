Psalm 2:1-12 2 Why are the nations agitated And the peoples muttering * an empty thing? + 2 The kings of the earth take their stand And high officials gather together * as one + Against Jehovah and against his anointed one. * + 3 They say: “Let us tear off their shackles And throw off their ropes!” 4 The One enthroned in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah will scoff at them. 5 At that time he will speak to them in his anger And terrify them in his burning anger, 6 Saying: “I myself have installed my king + On Zion, + my holy mountain.” 7 Let me proclaim the decree of Jehovah; He said to me: “You are my son; + Today I have become your father. + 8 Ask of me, and I will give nations as your inheritance And the ends of the earth as your possession. + 9 You will break them with an iron scepter, + And you will smash them like a piece of pottery.” + 10 So now, you kings, show insight; Accept correction, * you judges of the earth. 11 Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 12 Honor * the son, + or God * will become indignant And you will perish from the way, + For His anger flares up quickly. Happy are all those taking refuge in Him.
