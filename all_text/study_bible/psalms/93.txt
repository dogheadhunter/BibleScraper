Psalm 93:1-5 93 Jehovah has become King! + With grandeur he is clothed; Jehovah is clothed with strength; He wears it like a belt. The earth * is firmly established; It cannot be moved. * 2 Your throne was firmly established long ago; + From eternity you have existed. + 3 The rivers have surged, O Jehovah, The rivers have surged and roared; The rivers keep surging and pounding. 4 Above the sound of many waters, Mightier than the breaking waves of the sea, + Jehovah is majestic in the heights. + 5 Your reminders are very trustworthy. + Holiness adorns * your house, + O Jehovah, for all times.
