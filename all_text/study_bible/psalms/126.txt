Psalm 126:1-6 A Song of the Ascents. 126 When Jehovah gathered back the captives of Zion, + We thought we were dreaming. 2 At that time our mouth was filled with laughter And our tongue with a joyful shout. + At that time they said among the nations: “Jehovah has done great things for them.” + 3 Jehovah has done great things for us, + And we are overjoyed. 4 Do gather back * our captives, O Jehovah, Like streams in the Negʹeb. * 5 Those sowing seed with tears Will reap with a joyful shout. 6 The one who does go out, though weeping, Carrying his bag of seed, Will surely return with a joyful shout, + Carrying in his sheaves. + Footnotes ^ Or “restore.” ^ Or “wadis in the south.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
