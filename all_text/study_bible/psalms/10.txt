Psalm 10:1-18 ל [ Lamed ] 10 Why, O Jehovah, do you stand at a distance? Why do you hide yourself in times of distress? + 2 The wicked one arrogantly pursues the helpless one, + But he will be caught in the schemes he devises. + 3 For the wicked one boasts about his selfish desires * + And blesses the greedy one; * נ [ Nun ] He disrespects Jehovah. 4 In his haughtiness, the wicked man makes no investigation; All his thoughts are: “There is no God.” + 5 His ways keep prospering, + But your judgments are beyond his understanding; + He scoffs * at all his adversaries. 6 He says in his heart: “I will never be shaken; * For generation after generation I will never see calamity.” + פ [ Pe ] 7 His mouth is full of curses, lies, and threats; + Under his tongue are trouble and injury. + 8 He waits in ambush near the settlements; From his hiding place he kills an innocent one. + ע [ Ayin ] His eyes are watching for an unfortunate victim. + 9 He waits in his hiding place like a lion in its lair. * + He waits to seize the helpless one. He seizes the helpless one when he pulls his net shut. + 10 The victim is crushed and brought down; The unfortunate ones fall into his clutches. * 11 He says in his heart: “God has forgotten. + He has turned away his face. He never notices.” + ק [ Qoph ] 12 Rise up, O Jehovah. + O God, lift up your hand. + Do not forget the helpless ones. + 13 Why has the wicked one disrespected God? He says in his heart: “You will not hold me accountable.” ר [ Resh ] 14 But you do see trouble and distress. You look on and take matters in hand. + To you the unfortunate victim turns; + You are the helper for the fatherless child. * + ש [ Shin ] 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil man, + So that when you search for his wickedness, You will find it no more. 16 Jehovah is King forever and ever. + The nations have perished from the earth. + ת [ Taw ] 17 But you will hear the request of the meek, O Jehovah. + You will make their hearts firm + and pay close attention to them. + 18 You will render justice to the fatherless and to those who are crushed, + So that mortal man of the earth may no longer make them afraid. + Footnotes ^ Or “the desire of his soul.” ^ Or possibly, “The greedy one blesses himself.” ^ Or “puffs.” ^ Or “will never stagger (totter).” ^ Or “thicket.” ^ Or “strong claws.” ^ Or “the orphan.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
