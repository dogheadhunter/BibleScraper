Psalm 149:1-9 149 Praise Jah! * Sing to Jehovah a new song; + Praise him in the congregation of the loyal ones. + 2 Let Israel rejoice in its Grand Maker; + Let the sons of Zion be joyful in their King. 3 Let them praise his name with dancing + And sing praises * to him, accompanied by the tambourine and the harp. + 4 For Jehovah takes pleasure in his people. + He adorns the meek with salvation. + 5 Let the loyal ones exult in glory; Let them shout for joy upon their beds. + 6 Let the songs praising God be in their throat, And a two-edged sword be in their hand, 7 To execute vengeance on the nations And punishment on the peoples, 8 To bind their kings with shackles And their nobles with iron fetters, 9 To execute the judgment written against them. + This honor belongs to all his loyal ones.
