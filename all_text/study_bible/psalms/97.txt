Psalm 97:1-12 97 Jehovah has become King! + Let the earth be joyful. + Let the many islands rejoice. + 2 Clouds and thick gloom are all around him; + Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. + 3 Fire goes before him + And consumes his adversaries on every side. + 4 His lightning bolts light up the land; The earth sees it and trembles. + 5 The mountains melt like wax before Jehovah, + Before the Lord of the whole earth. 6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, And all the peoples see his glory. + 7 Let all those serving any carved image be put to shame, + Those who boast about their worthless gods. + Bow down to * him, all you gods. + 8 Zion hears and rejoices; + The towns * of Judah are joyful Because of your judgments, O Jehovah. + 9 For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all other gods. + 10 O you who love Jehovah, hate what is bad. + He is guarding the lives * of his loyal ones; + He rescues them from the hand * of the wicked. + 11 Light has flashed up for the righteous + And rejoicing for those upright in heart. 12 Rejoice in Jehovah, you righteous ones, And give thanks to his holy name. * Footnotes ^ Or “Worship.” ^ Lit., “daughters.” ^ Or “souls.” ^ Or “power.” ^ Lit., “memorial.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
