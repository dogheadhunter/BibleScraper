Psalm 137:1-9 137 By the rivers of Babylon, + there we sat. We wept when we remembered Zion. + 2 Upon the poplar trees in her * midst, We hung our harps. + 3 For there our captors asked us for a song, + Those mocking us wanted amusement: “Sing for us one of the songs of Zion.” 4 How can we sing the song of Jehovah On foreign soil? 5 If I should forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand be forgetful. * + 6 Let my tongue stick to my palate If I do not remember you, If I do not place Jerusalem above My greatest reasons for rejoicing. + 7 Remember, O Jehovah, What the Eʹdom·ites said on the day Jerusalem fell: “Tear it down! Tear it down to its foundations!” + 8 O daughter of Babylon, who is soon to be devastated, + Happy will be the one who rewards you With the treatment you inflicted on us. + 9 Happy will be the one who seizes your children And dashes them against the rocks. + Footnotes ^ Referring to Babylon. ^ Or possibly, “wither.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
