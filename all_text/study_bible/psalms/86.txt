Psalm 86:1-17 A prayer of David. 86 Incline your ear, * O Jehovah, and answer me, For I am afflicted and poor. + 2 Guard my life, * for I am loyal. + Save your servant who is trusting in you, For you are my God. + 3 Show me favor, O Jehovah, + For I call to you all day long. + 4 Make your servant * rejoice, For to you, O Jehovah, I turn. * 5 For you, O Jehovah, are good + and ready to forgive; + You abound in loyal love for all those who call on you. + 6 Listen, O Jehovah, to my prayer; And pay attention to my pleas for help. + 7 I call on you in the day of my distress, + For you will answer me. + 8 There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, + There are no works like yours. + 9 All the nations that you made Will come and bow down before you, O Jehovah, + And they will give glory to your name. + 10 For you are great and do wondrous things; + You are God, you alone. + 11 Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. + I will walk in your truth. + Unify my heart * to fear your name. + 12 I praise you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, + And I will glorify your name forever, 13 For your loyal love toward me is great, And you have saved my life * from the depths of the Grave. * + 14 O God, presumptuous men rise up against me; + A band of ruthless men seek to take my life, * And they have no regard for you. * + 15 But you, O Jehovah, are a God merciful and compassionate, * Slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and faithfulness. * + 16 Turn to me and show me favor. + Give your strength to your servant, + And save the son of your slave girl. 17 Show me a sign * of your goodness, So that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame. For you, O Jehovah, are my helper and comforter.
