Psalm 24:1-10 Of David. A melody. 24 To Jehovah belong the earth and everything in it, + The productive land and those dwelling on it. 2 For he has solidly fixed it on the seas + And firmly established it on the rivers. 3 Who may ascend to the mountain of Jehovah, + And who may stand up in his holy place? 4 Anyone with innocent hands and a pure heart, + Who has not sworn a false oath by My life, * Nor taken an oath deceitfully. + 5 He will receive blessings from Jehovah + And righteousness * from his God of salvation. + 6 This is the generation of those seeking him, Of those seeking your face, O God of Jacob. ( Selah ) 7 Lift up your heads, you gates; + Open up, * you ancient doorways, That the glorious King may enter! + 8 Who is this glorious King? Jehovah, strong and mighty, + Jehovah, mighty in battle. + 9 Lift up your heads, you gates; + Open up, you ancient doorways, That the glorious King may enter! 10 Who is he, this glorious King? Jehovah of armies—he is the glorious King. + ( Selah ) Footnotes ^ Or “My soul,” referring to Jehovah’s life by which an individual swears. ^ Or “justice.” ^ Or “Rise up.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
