Psalm 46:1-11 To the director. Of the sons of Korʹah. + According to the Alʹa·moth style. * A song. 46 God is our refuge and strength, + A help that is readily found in times of distress. + 2 That is why we will not fear, though the earth undergoes change, Though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea, + 3 Though its waters roar and foam over, + Though the mountains rock on account of its turbulence. ( Selah ) 4 There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, + The holy grand tabernacle of the Most High. 5 God is in the city; + it cannot be overthrown. God will come to its aid at the break of dawn. + 6 The nations were in an uproar, the kingdoms were overthrown; He raised his voice, and the earth melted. + 7 Jehovah of armies is with us; + The God of Jacob is our secure refuge. * ( Selah ) 8 Come and witness the activities of Jehovah, How he has done astonishing things on the earth. 9 He is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth. + He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the military wagons * with fire. 10 “Give in and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations; + I will be exalted in the earth.” + 11 Jehovah of armies is with us; + The God of Jacob is a secure refuge for us. + ( Selah ) Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or possibly, “the shields.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
