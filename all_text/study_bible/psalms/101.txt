Psalm 101:1-8 Of David. A melody. 101 I will sing about loyal love and justice. To you, O Jehovah, I will sing praises. * 2 I will act with discretion and blamelessness. * When will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart + inside my house. 3 I will not set anything worthless * before my eyes. I hate the deeds of those who deviate from what is right; + I will have nothing to do with them. * 4 A crooked heart is far from me; I will not accept * what is bad. 5 Anyone slandering his neighbor in secret, + I will silence. * Anyone with haughty eyes and an arrogant heart, I will not tolerate. 6 I will look to the faithful ones of the earth, So that they may dwell with me. The one walking in blamelessness * will minister to me. 7 No deceitful person will dwell in my house, And no liar will stand in my presence. * 8 Every morning I will silence * all the wicked of the earth, To cut off all wrongdoers from the city of Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “make music.” ^ Or “integrity.” ^ Or “good-for-nothing.” ^ Or “Their deeds do not cling to me.” ^ Lit., “know.” ^ Or “do away with.” ^ Or “in integrity.” ^ Lit., “in front of my eyes.” ^ Or “do away with.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
