Psalm 37:1-40 Of David. א [ Aleph ] 37 Do not be upset * because of evil men Or envious of wrongdoers. + 2 They will quickly wither like grass + And shrivel like green new grass. ב [ Beth ] 3 Trust in Jehovah and do what is good; + Reside in the earth, * and act with faithfulness. + 4 Find exquisite delight * in Jehovah, And he will grant you the desires of your heart. ג [ Gimel ] 5 Commit your way to * Jehovah; + Rely on him, and he will act in your behalf. + 6 He will make your righteousness shine like daybreak, And your justice like the midday sun. ד [ Daleth ] 7 Keep silent before Jehovah + And wait expectantly * for him. Do not be upset by the man Who succeeds in carrying out his schemes. + ה [ He ] 8 Let go of anger and abandon rage; + Do not become upset and turn to doing evil. * 9 For evil men will be done away with, + But those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth. + ו [ Waw ] 10 Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; + You will look at where they were, And they will not be there. + 11 But the meek will possess the earth, + And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. + ז [ Zayin ] 12 The wicked man plots against the righteous; + He grinds his teeth at him. 13 But Jehovah will laugh at him, For He knows that his day will come. + ח [ Heth ] 14 The wicked draw their swords and bend * their bows To bring down the oppressed and the poor, To slaughter those whose way is upright. 15 But their sword will pierce their own heart; + Their bows will be broken. ט [ Teth ] 16 Better is the little of the righteous one Than the abundance of many wicked ones. + 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken, But Jehovah will support the righteous. י [ Yod ] 18 Jehovah is aware of what the blameless go through, * And their inheritance will last forever. + 19 They will not be put to shame in the time of disaster; In the time of famine they will have plenty. כ [ Kaph ] 20 But the wicked will perish; + The enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures; They will vanish like smoke. ל [ Lamed ] 21 The wicked one borrows and does not repay, But the righteous one is generous * and giving. + 22 Those blessed by Him will possess the earth, But those cursed by Him will be done away with. + מ [ Mem ] 23 Jehovah guides * the steps of a man + When He finds pleasure in his way. + 24 Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down, + For Jehovah supports him by the hand. * + נ [ Nun ] 25 I was once young and now I am old, But I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned, + Nor his children looking for bread. * + 26 He always lends freely, + And his children are in line for a blessing. ס [ Samekh ] 27 Turn away from bad and do what is good, + And you will remain forever. 28 For Jehovah loves justice, And he will not abandon his loyal ones. + ע [ Ayin ] They will always be guarded; + But the descendants of the wicked will be done away with. + 29 The righteous will possess the earth, + And they will live forever on it. + פ [ Pe ] 30 The mouth of the righteous one imparts wisdom, * And his tongue speaks about justice. + 31 The law of his God is in his heart; + His steps will not falter. + צ [ Tsade ] 32 The wicked watches the righteous, Seeking to put him to death. 33 But Jehovah will not abandon him to the hand of that one + Or find him guilty when he is judged. + ק [ Qoph ] 34 Hope in Jehovah and follow his way, And he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked are done away with, + you will see it. + ר [ Resh ] 35 I have seen the ruthless, evil man Spreading out like a luxuriant tree in its native soil. + 36 But he suddenly passed away and was gone; + I kept searching for him, and he could not be found. + ש [ Shin ] 37 Take note of the blameless one, * And keep the upright one + in sight, For the future of that man will be peaceful. + 38 But all the transgressors will be destroyed; The future of wicked people will be cut off. + ת [ Taw ] 39 The salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah; + He is their fortress in the time of distress. + 40 Jehovah will help them and rescue them. + He will rescue them from the wicked and save them, Because they take refuge in him. + Footnotes ^ Or “show yourself heated up.” ^ Or “land.” ^ Or “Find your greatest joy.” ^ Lit., “Roll your way upon.” ^ Or “patiently.” ^ Or possibly, “Do not become upset, for it can only lead to harm.” ^ Or “string.” ^ Lit., “the days of the blameless.” ^ Or “showing favor.” ^ Or “makes firm.” ^ Or “with His hand.” ^ Or “food.” ^ Or “utters wisdom in an undertone.” ^ Or “the one who keeps integrity.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
