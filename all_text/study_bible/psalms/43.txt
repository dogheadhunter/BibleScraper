Psalm 43:1-5 43 Judge me, O God, + Defend my legal case + against a disloyal nation. Rescue me from the man of deception and unrighteousness. 2 For you are my God, my fortress. + Why have you cast me off? Why must I walk about sad because of the oppression by my enemy? + 3 Send out your light and your truth. + May these lead me; + May they guide me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle. + 4 Then I will come to the altar of God, + To God, my exceeding joy. And I will praise you with the harp, + O God, my God. 5 Why am I * in despair? Why is this turmoil within me? Wait for God, + For I will yet praise him as my Grand Savior and my God. + Footnotes ^ Or “is my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
