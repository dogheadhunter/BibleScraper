Psalm 125:1-5 A Song of the Ascents. 125 Those who trust in Jehovah + Are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken But endures forever. + 2 Just as mountains surround Jerusalem, + So Jehovah surrounds his people + From now on and forever. 3 The scepter of wickedness will not remain upon the land allotted to the righteous, + So that the righteous do not turn to doing * what is wrong. + 4 Do good, O Jehovah, to those who are good, + To those who are upright in heart. + 5 As for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Jehovah will remove them along with the wrongdoers. + May there be peace upon Israel.
