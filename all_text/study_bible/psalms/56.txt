Psalm 56:1-13 To the director; set to “The Silent Dove That Is Far Away.” Of David. Mikʹtam. * When the Phi·lisʹtines captured him in Gath. + 56 Show me favor, O God, because mortal man is attacking * me. All day long they keep fighting and oppressing me. 2 My foes keep snapping at me all day long; Many arrogantly fight against me. 3 When I am afraid, + I put my trust in you. + 4 In God—whose word I praise— In God I put my trust; I am not afraid. What can mere man * do to me? + 5 All day long they hurt my interests; Their only thought is to harm me. + 6 They conceal themselves to attack; They watch my every step, + Hoping to take away my life. * + 7 Reject them because of their wickedness. Bring down the nations in your anger, O God. + 8 You keep track of my wandering. + Do collect my tears in your skin bottle. + Are they not recorded in your book? + 9 My enemies will retreat on the day that I call for help. + Of this I am confident: God is on my side. + 10 In God—whose word I praise— In Jehovah—whose word I praise— 11 In God I put my trust; I am not afraid. + What can a mere human do to me? + 12 I am bound by my vows to you, O God; + I will offer you expressions of thanksgiving. + 13 For you have rescued me * from death + And prevented my feet from stumbling, + So that I may walk before God in the light of the living. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “snapping at.” ^ Lit., “flesh.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
