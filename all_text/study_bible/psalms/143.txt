Psalm 143:1-12 A melody of David. 143 O Jehovah, hear my prayer; + Listen to my plea for help. In your faithfulness and in your righteousness, answer me. 2 Do not enter into judgment with your servant, For no one living can be righteous before you. + 3 For the enemy pursues me; * He has crushed my life into the ground. He has caused me to dwell in darkness like those long dead. 4 My spirit * is failing; + My heart is numb within me. + 5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all your activity; + I eagerly ponder over * the work of your hands. 6 I spread out my hands to you; I am * like a parched land that thirsts for you. + ( Selah ) 7 Do answer me quickly, O Jehovah; + My strength * has come to an end. + Do not hide your face from me, + Or I will be like those going down into the pit. * + 8 Let me hear your loyal love in the morning, For I trust in you. Make known to me the way I should walk, + For to you I turn. * 9 Rescue me from my enemies, O Jehovah. I seek your protection. + 10 Teach me to do your will, + For you are my God. Your spirit is good; May it lead me on level ground. * 11 For the sake of your name, O Jehovah, preserve me alive. In your righteousness, rescue me * from distress. + 12 In your loyal love, put an end to * my enemies; + Destroy all those harassing me, * + For I am your servant. + Footnotes ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “strength.” ^ Or “study.” ^ Or “My soul is.” ^ Or “grave.” ^ Lit., “spirit.” ^ Or “For I lift up my soul to you.” ^ Or “in the land of uprightness.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Lit., “silence.” ^ Or “my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
