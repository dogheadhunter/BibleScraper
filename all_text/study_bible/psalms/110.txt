Psalm 110:1-7 Of David. A melody. 110 Jehovah declared to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand + Until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” + 2 Jehovah will extend the scepter of your power out of Zion, saying: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” + 3 Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force. * In splendid holiness, from the womb of the dawn, You have your company of young men just like dewdrops. 4 Jehovah has sworn an oath, and he will not change his mind: * “You are a priest forever + In the manner of Mel·chizʹe·dek!” + 5 Jehovah will be at your right hand; + He will crush kings on the day of his anger. + 6 He will execute judgment against * the nations; + He will fill the land with dead bodies. + He will crush the leader * of a vast land. * 7 He * will drink from the stream along the road. Therefore, he will hold his head high.
