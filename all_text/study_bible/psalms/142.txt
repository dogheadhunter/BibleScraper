Psalm 142:1-7 Masʹkil. * Of David when he was in the cave. + A prayer. 142 With my voice I call to Jehovah for help; + With my voice I plead with Jehovah for favor. 2 Before him I pour out my concern; Before him I tell about my distress + 3 When my spirit * fails within me. Then you watch my roadway. + In the path where I walk, They hide a trap for me. 4 Look at my right hand and see That no one cares about * me. + There is nowhere I can flee; + No one is concerned about me. * 5 I call to you, O Jehovah, for help. I say: “You are my refuge, + All I have * in the land of the living.” 6 Pay attention to my cry for help, For I have been brought very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, + For they are stronger than I am. 7 Bring me * out of the dungeon To praise your name. May the righteous gather around me Because you deal kindly with me.
