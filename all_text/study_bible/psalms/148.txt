Praise him, all shining stars. + 4 Praise him, O highest heavens * And waters above the heavens. 5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah, For he commanded, and they were created. + 6 He keeps them established forever and ever; + He has issued a decree that will not pass away. + 7 Praise Jehovah from the earth, You great sea creatures and all deep waters, 8 You lightning and hail, snow and thick clouds, You storm wind, carrying out his word, + 9 You mountains and all you hills, + You fruit trees and all you cedars, + 10 You wild animals + and all you domestic animals, You creeping things and winged birds, 11 You kings of the earth and all you nations, You princes and all you judges of the earth, + 12 You young men and young women, * Old men and young together. * 13 Let them praise the name of Jehovah, For his name alone is unreachably high. + His majesty is above earth and heaven. + 14 He will exalt the strength * of his people, For the praise of all his loyal ones, Of the sons of Israel, the people close to him.
