Psalm 4:1-8 To the director; to be accompanied with stringed instruments. A melody of David. 4 When I call, answer me, O my righteous God. + Make a way of escape * for me in my distress. Show me favor and hear my prayer. 2 You sons of men, how long will you turn my honor into humiliation? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is false? ( Selah ) 3 Know that Jehovah will treat his loyal one in a special way; * Jehovah will hear when I call to him. 4 Be agitated, but do not sin. + Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. ( Selah ) 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in Jehovah. + 6 There are many saying: “Who will show us anything good?” Let the light of your face shine upon us, O Jehovah. + 7 You have filled my heart with greater rejoicing Than those who have an abundant harvest of grain and new wine. 8 I will lie down and sleep in peace, + For you alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Make broad space.” ^ Or “distinguish his loyal one; set his loyal one apart for himself.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
