Psalm 102:1-28 A prayer of the oppressed one when he is in despair * and pours out his concern before Jehovah. + 102 O Jehovah, hear my prayer; + Let my cry for help reach you. + 2 Do not hide your face from me in my time of distress. + Incline your ear * to me; Do answer me quickly when I call. + 3 For my days are vanishing like smoke, And my bones are charred like a fireplace. + 4 My heart has been struck down like grass and has withered, + For I forget to eat my food. 5 Because of my loud groaning, + My bones cling to my flesh. + 6 I resemble the pelican of the wilderness; I am like a little owl among the ruins. 7 I lie awake; * I am like a solitary bird on a roof. + 8 All day long my enemies taunt me. + Those who mock me * use my name as a curse. 9 For I eat ashes as my bread, + And my drink is mingled with tears, + 10 Because of your anger and your indignation, For you lifted me up only to cast me aside. 11 My days are like a fading shadow, * + And I am withering like grass. + 12 But you remain forever, O Jehovah, + And your fame * will endure for all generations. + 13 Surely you will rise up and show mercy on Zion, + For it is time to show her your favor; + The appointed time has come. + 14 For your servants find pleasure in her stones + And have affection even for her dust. + 15 The nations will fear the name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth your glory. + 16 For Jehovah will rebuild Zion; + He will appear in his glory. + 17 He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute; + He will not despise their prayer. + 18 This is written for the future generation, + So that a people yet to be brought forth * will praise Jah. 19 For he looks down from his holy height, + From the heavens Jehovah views the earth, 20 To hear the sighing of the prisoner, + To release those sentenced to death, + 21 So that the name of Jehovah will be declared in Zion + And his praise in Jerusalem, 22 When the peoples and kingdoms Gather together to serve Jehovah. + 23 He prematurely robbed me of my strength; He cut short my days. 24 I said: “O my God, Do not do away with me in the middle of my life, You whose years span all generations. + 25 Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth, And the heavens are the work of your hands. + 26 They will perish, but you will remain; Just like a garment they will all wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will pass away. 27 But you are the same, and your years will never end. + 28 The children of your servants will dwell securely, And their offspring will be firmly established before you.” + Footnotes ^ Or “he grows weak.” ^ Or “Bend down and listen.” ^ Or possibly, “I am emaciated.” ^ Or “make a fool of me.” ^ Or “a lengthening shadow.” ^ Or “name.” Lit., “memorial.” ^ Lit., “be created.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
