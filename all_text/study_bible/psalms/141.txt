Psalm 141:1-10 A melody of David. 141 O Jehovah, I call on you. + Come quickly to help me. + Do pay attention when I call to you. + 2 May my prayer be as incense + prepared before you, + My uplifted hands like the evening grain offering. + 3 Station a guard for my mouth, O Jehovah, Do set a watch over the door of my lips. + 4 Do not let my heart incline to anything bad, + To share in vile deeds with evil men; May I never feast on their delicacies. 5 Should the righteous one strike me, it would be an act of loyal love; + Should he reprove me, it would be like oil on my head, + Which my head would never refuse. + My prayer will continue even during their calamities. 6 Though their judges are thrown down from the cliff, The people will pay attention to my words, for they are pleasant. 7 Just as when someone plows and breaks up the soil, So our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the Grave. * 8 But my eyes look to you, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. + In you I have taken refuge. Do not take away my life. * 9 Protect me from the jaws of the trap they have laid for me, From the snares of evildoers. 10 The wicked will fall into their own nets all together + While I pass by safely.
