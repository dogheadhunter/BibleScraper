Psalm 85:1-13 For the director. Of the sons of Korʹah. + A melody. 85 You have shown favor, O Jehovah, to your land; + You brought back those of Jacob who were taken captive. + 2 You have pardoned the error of your people; You forgave * all their sin. + ( Selah ) 3 You held back all your fury; You turned away from your hot anger. + 4 Restore us, * O God of our salvation, And set aside your displeasure with us. + 5 Will you be furious with us forever? + Will you prolong your anger to generation after generation? 6 Will you not revive us again So that your people may rejoice in you? + 7 Show your loyal love to us, O Jehovah, + And grant us your salvation. 8 I will listen to what the true God Jehovah says, For he will speak peace to his people, + to his loyal ones, But let them not return to overconfidence. + 9 Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, + So that his glory may reside in our land. 10 Loyal love and faithfulness will meet together; Righteousness and peace will kiss each other. + 11 Faithfulness will sprout from the earth, And righteousness will look down from the heavens. + 12 Yes, Jehovah will give what is good, * + And our land will yield its harvest. + 13 Righteousness will walk before him + And make a path for his footsteps.
