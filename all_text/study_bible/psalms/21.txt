Psalm 21:1-13 To the director. A melody of David. 21 O Jehovah, in your strength the king rejoices; + How greatly he rejoices in your acts of salvation! + 2 You have granted him the desire of his heart, + And you have not withheld the request of his lips. ( Selah ) 3 For you meet him with rich blessings; You place a crown of fine * gold on his head. + 4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him, + A long life, * forever and ever. 5 Your acts of salvation bring him great glory. + Dignity and splendor you bestow on him. 6 You make him blessed forever; + You make him glad with the joy of your presence. * + 7 For the king trusts in Jehovah; + Because of the loyal love of the Most High, he will never be shaken. * + 8 Your hand will find all your enemies; Your right hand will find those hating you. 9 You will make them like a fiery furnace at the appointed time when you give them attention. Jehovah will swallow them up in his anger, and fire will consume them. + 10 Their descendants * you will destroy from the earth, And their offspring from the sons of men. 11 For they intended to do what is bad against you; + They have devised schemes that will not succeed. + 12 For you will make them retreat + By aiming your bow * at them. * 13 Rise up, O Jehovah, in your strength. We will sing praises * to your mightiness.
