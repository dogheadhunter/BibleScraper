Psalm 83:1-18 A song. A melody of Aʹsaph. + 83 O God, do not be silent; + Do not keep quiet * or still, O Divine One. 2 For look! your enemies are in an uproar; + Those who hate you act arrogantly. * 3 With cunning they secretly plot against your people; They conspire against your treasured ones. * 4 They say: “Come, let us annihilate them as a nation, + So that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” 5 They devise a unified strategy; * They have made an alliance * against you + — 6 The tents of Eʹdom and the Ishʹma·el·ites, Moʹab + and the Hagʹrites, + 7 Geʹbal and Amʹmon + and Amʹa·lek, Phi·lisʹti·a + together with the inhabitants of Tyre. + 8 As·syrʹi·a + too has joined them; They give support to * the sons of Lot. + ( Selah ) 9 Do to them as you did to Midʹi·an, + As you did to Sisʹe·ra and Jaʹbin at the stream * of Kiʹshon. + 10 They were annihilated at En-dor; + They became manure for the ground. 11 Make their nobles like Oʹreb and Zeʹeb + And their princes * like Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna, + 12 For they said: “Let us take possession of the land where God dwells.” 13 O my God, make them like a whirling thistle, * + Like stubble blown about by the wind. 14 Like a fire that burns up the forest, Like a flame that scorches the mountains, + 15 So may you pursue them with your tempest + And terrify them with your windstorm. + 16 Cover * their faces with dishonor, So that they may search for your name, O Jehovah. 17 May they be put to shame and be terrified forever; May they be disgraced and perish; 18 May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, + You alone are the Most High over all the earth. + Footnotes ^ Or “keep speechless.” ^ Or “raise their heads.” ^ Lit., “concealed ones.” ^ Or “a covenant.” ^ Lit., “They consult with a heart together.” ^ Lit., “have become an arm to.” ^ Or “wadi.” ^ Or “leaders.” ^ Or “like tumbleweed.” ^ Lit., “Fill.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
