Psalm 81:1-16 To the director; upon the Gitʹtith. * Of Aʹsaph. + 81 Shout joyfully to God our strength. + Shout in triumph to the God of Jacob. 2 Begin the music and take a tambourine, The melodious harp together with the stringed instrument. 3 Blow the horn on the new moon, + On the full moon, for the day of our festival. + 4 For it is a decree for Israel, A ruling of the God of Jacob. + 5 He established it as a reminder for Joseph + When He went out against the land of Egypt. + I heard a voice * that I did not recognize: 6 “I lifted the burden from his shoulder; + His hands were freed from the basket. 7 In your distress you called, and I rescued you; + I answered you from the thundercloud. * + I tested you at the waters of Merʹi·bah. * + ( Selah ) 8 Hear, my people, and I will testify against you. O Israel, if you would only listen to me. + 9 Among you, there will be no strange god, And you will not bow down to a foreign god. + 10 I, Jehovah, am your God, The one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. + Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. + 11 But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me. + 12 So I let them follow their stubborn hearts; They did what they thought was right. * + 13 If only my people would listen to me, + If only Israel would walk in my ways! + 14 Their enemies I would quickly subdue; I would turn my hand against their adversaries. + 15 Those who hate Jehovah will cringe in his presence, And their outcome * will be forever. 16 But he will feed you * with the finest * wheat + And satisfy you with honey from the rock.” + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “language.” ^ Meaning “Quarreling.” ^ Lit., “in the hidden place of thunder.” ^ Lit., “They walked in their counsels.” ^ Lit., “time.” ^ Lit., “him,” that is, God’s people. ^ Lit., “the fat of.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
