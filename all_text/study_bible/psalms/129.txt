Psalm 129:1-8 A Song of the Ascents. 129 “Since my youth they have constantly attacked me” + —Let Israel now say— 2 “Since my youth they have constantly attacked me; + But they have not defeated me. + 3 Plowmen have plowed across my back; + They have made their furrows long.” 4 But Jehovah is righteous; + He has cut up the ropes of the wicked. + 5 They will be put to shame and will retreat in disgrace, All those who hate Zion. + 6 They will become like grass on the rooftops That withers before it is pulled up, 7 That cannot fill the reaper’s hand Nor the arms of the one gathering sheaves. 8 Those passing by will not say: “May the blessing of Jehovah be upon you; We bless you in the name of Jehovah.” Footnotes Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
