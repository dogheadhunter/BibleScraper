Psalm 82:1-8 A melody of Aʹsaph. + 82 God takes his place in the divine assembly; * + In the middle of the gods * he judges: + 2 “How long will you continue to judge with injustice + And show partiality to the wicked? + ( Selah ) 3 Defend * the lowly and the fatherless. + Render justice to the helpless and destitute. + 4 Rescue the lowly and the poor; Save them out of the hand of the wicked.” 5 They do not know, nor do they understand; + They are walking about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are being shaken. + 6 “I have said, ‘You are gods, * + All of you are sons of the Most High. 7 But you will die just as men do; + And like any other prince you will fall!’” + 8 Rise up, O God, and judge the earth, + For all the nations belong to you.
