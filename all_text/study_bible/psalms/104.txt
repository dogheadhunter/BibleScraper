Psalm 104:1-35 104 Let me * praise Jehovah. + O Jehovah my God, you are very great. + With majesty * and splendor you are clothed. + 2 You are wrapped in light + as with a garment; You stretch out the heavens like a tent cloth. + 3 He lays beams of his upper rooms in the waters above, * + Making the clouds his chariot, + Moving on the wings of the wind. + 4 He makes his angels spirits, His ministers a consuming fire. + 5 He has established the earth on its foundations; + It will not be moved from its place * forever and ever. + 6 You covered it with deep waters as with a garment. + The waters stood above the mountains. 7 At your rebuke they fled; + At the sound of your thunder they ran away in panic 8 —Mountains ascended + and valleys descended— To the place you established for them. 9 You set a boundary that they should not pass, + That they should never again cover the earth. 10 He sends springs into the valleys; * Between the mountains they flow. 11 They provide water for all the wild beasts of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst. 12 Above them roost the birds of the sky; They sing among the thick foliage. 13 He is watering the mountains from his upper rooms. + With the fruitage of your works the earth is satisfied. + 14 He is making grass grow for the cattle And vegetation for mankind’s use, + To grow food from the land 15 And wine that makes man’s heart rejoice, + Oil that makes the face shine, And bread that sustains the heart of mortal man. + 16 The trees of Jehovah are satisfied, The cedars of Lebʹa·non that he planted, 17 Where the birds make nests. The home of the stork + is in the juniper trees. 18 The high mountains are for the mountain goats; + The crags are a refuge for the rock badgers. + 19 He has made the moon to mark the appointed times; The sun well knows when to set. + 20 You bring darkness, and night falls, + When all the wild animals of the forest roam about. 21 The young lions * roar for their prey + And seek their food from God. + 22 When the sun rises, They withdraw and lie down in their dens. 23 Man goes to his work, And he labors until evening. 24 How many your works are, O Jehovah! + You have made all of them in wisdom. + The earth is full of what you have made. 25 There is the sea, so great and wide, Teeming with countless living things, both small and great. + 26 There the ships travel, And Le·viʹa·than, * + which you formed to play in it. 27 All of them wait for you To give them their food in its season. + 28 What you give them, they gather. + When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things. + 29 When you hide your face, they are disturbed. If you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust. + 30 If you send out your spirit, they are created, + And you renew the surface of the ground. 31 The glory of Jehovah will last forever. Jehovah will rejoice in his works. + 32 He looks at the earth, and it trembles; He touches the mountains, and they smoke. + 33 I will sing to Jehovah + throughout my life; I will sing praises * to my God as long as I live. + 34 Let my thoughts be pleasing to him. * I will rejoice in Jehovah. 35 The sinners will vanish from the earth, And the wicked will no longer exist. + Let me * praise Jehovah.
