Psalm 116:1-19 116 I love Jehovah Because he hears * my voice, my pleas for help. + 2 For he inclines his ear * to me, + And I will call on him as long as I live. * 3 The ropes of death encircled me; The Grave had me in its grip. * + I was overcome by distress and grief. + 4 But I called on the name of Jehovah: + “O Jehovah, rescue me!” * 5 Jehovah is compassionate * and righteous; + Our God is merciful. + 6 Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced. + I was brought low, and he saved me. 7 Let my soul * rest once again, For Jehovah has dealt kindly with me. 8 You have rescued me * from death, My eye from tears, my foot from stumbling. + 9 I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living. 10 I had faith, for I spoke; + I was greatly afflicted. 11 As for me, I panicked and said: “Every man is a liar.” + 12 With what will I repay Jehovah For all the good he has done for me? 13 I will take up the cup of salvation, * And I will call on the name of Jehovah. 14 I will pay my vows to Jehovah In the presence of all his people. + 15 Costly * in the eyes of Jehovah Is the death of his loyal ones. + 16 I beg you, O Jehovah, For I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have freed me from my bonds. + 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving; + I will call on the name of Jehovah. 18 I will pay my vows to Jehovah + In the presence of all his people, + 19 In the courtyards of the house of Jehovah, + In your midst, O Jerusalem.
