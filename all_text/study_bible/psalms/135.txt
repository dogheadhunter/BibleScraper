Psalm 135:1-21 135 Praise Jah! * Praise the name of Jehovah; Offer praise, you servants of Jehovah, + 2 You who are standing in the house of Jehovah, In the courtyards of the house of our God. + 3 Praise Jah, for Jehovah is good. + Sing praises * to his name, for it is pleasant. 4 For Jah has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his special property. * + 5 For I well know that Jehovah is great; Our Lord is greater than all other gods. + 6 Jehovah does everything he pleases to do + In heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the depths. 7 He causes clouds * to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for * the rain; He brings the wind out of his storehouses. + 8 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, Both man and beast. + 9 He sent signs and miracles among you, O Egypt, + Against Pharʹaoh and all his servants. + 10 He struck down many nations + And killed mighty kings + 11 —Siʹhon the king of the Amʹor·ites, + Og the king of Baʹshan, + And all the kingdoms of Caʹnaan. 12 He gave their land as an inheritance, An inheritance to Israel his people. + 13 O Jehovah, your name endures forever. O Jehovah, your fame * endures for all generations. + 14 For Jehovah will defend * his people, + And he will feel compassion * for his servants. + 15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of human hands. + 16 A mouth they have, but they cannot speak; + Eyes, but they cannot see; 17 Ears they have, but they cannot hear. There is no breath in their mouth. + 18 The people who make them will become just like them, + As will all those who trust in them. + 19 O house of Israel, praise Jehovah. O house of Aaron, praise Jehovah. 20 O house of Leʹvi, praise Jehovah. + You who fear Jehovah, praise Jehovah. 21 May Jehovah be praised from Zion, + The One residing in Jerusalem. + Praise Jah! + Footnotes ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Or “Make music.” ^ Or “treasured possession.” ^ Or possibly, “makes sluices for.” ^ Or “vapors.” ^ Or “name.” Lit., “memorial.” ^ Or “plead the cause of.” ^ Or “feel regret.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
