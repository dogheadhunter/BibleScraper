Set to the melody “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of Aʹsaph. + A song. 75 We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you; Your name is near, + And people declare your wondrous works. 2 You say: “When I set a time, I judge with fairness. 3 When the earth and all its inhabitants were dissolved, It was I who kept its pillars firm.” ( Selah ) 4 I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,” And to the wicked, “Do not exalt your strength. * 5 Do not exalt your strength * up high Or speak with arrogance. 6 For exaltation does not come From the east or the west or the south. 7 For God is Judge. + He puts one man down and exalts another. + 8 For there is a cup in Jehovah’s hand; + The wine is foaming and is fully mixed. He will surely pour it out, And all the wicked of the earth will drink it, down to the dregs.” + 9 But as for me, I will proclaim it forever; I will sing praises * to the God of Jacob. 10 For he says: “I will cut off all the strength * of the wicked, But the strength * of the righteous will be exalted.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “horn.” ^ Lit., “horn.” ^ Or “make music.” ^ Lit., “horns.” ^ Lit., “horns.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
