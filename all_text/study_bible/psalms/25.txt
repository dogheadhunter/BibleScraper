Psalm 25:1-22 Of David. א [ Aleph ] 25 To you, O Jehovah, I turn. * ב [ Beth ] 2 My God, I trust in you; + Do not let me be put to shame. + Do not let my enemies gloat over me. + ג [ Gimel ] 3 Surely none who hope in you will be put to shame, + But shame awaits those who are treacherous without cause. + ד [ Daleth ] 4 Make me know your ways, O Jehovah; + Teach me your paths. + ה [ He ] 5 Cause me to walk in your truth and teach me, + For you are my God of salvation. ו [ Waw ] In you I hope all day long. ז [ Zayin ] 6 Remember your mercy, O Jehovah, and your loyal love, + Which you have always shown. * + ח [ Heth ] 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth and my transgressions. Remember me according to your loyal love, + For the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah. + ט [ Teth ] 8 Good and upright is Jehovah. + That is why he instructs sinners in the way to live. + י [ Yod ] 9 He will guide the meek in what is right, * + And he will teach the meek ones his way. + כ [ Kaph ] 10 All the paths of Jehovah are loyal love and faithfulness For those observing his covenant + and his reminders. + ל [ Lamed ] 11 For the sake of your name, O Jehovah, + Forgive my error, though it is great. מ [ Mem ] 12 Who is the man fearing Jehovah? + He will instruct him about the way he should choose. + נ [ Nun ] 13 He * will experience what is good, + And his descendants * will take possession of the earth. + ס [ Samekh ] 14 Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him, + And he makes his covenant known to them. + ע [ Ayin ] 15 My eyes are always toward Jehovah, + For he will free my feet from the net. + פ [ Pe ] 16 Turn your face to me and show me favor, For I am alone and helpless. צ [ Tsade ] 17 The distresses of my heart have multiplied; + Free me from my anguish. ר [ Resh ] 18 See my affliction and my trouble, + And pardon all my sins. + 19 See how numerous my enemies are And how violent their hatred is for me. ש [ Shin ] 20 Guard my life * and save me. + Do not let me be put to shame, for I have taken refuge in you. ת [ Taw ] 21 May integrity and uprightness safeguard me, + For my hope is in you. + 22 O God, rescue * Israel out of all his distresses.
