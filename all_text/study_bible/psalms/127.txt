Psalm 127:1-5 A Song of the Ascents. Of Solomon. 127 Unless Jehovah builds the house, It is in vain that its builders work hard on it. + Unless Jehovah guards the city, + It is in vain that the guard stays awake. 2 It is in vain that you rise up early, That you stay up late, That you toil for your food, Since he provides for his loved ones while giving them sleep. + 3 Look! Sons * are an inheritance from Jehovah; + The fruit of the womb is a reward. + 4 Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, So are the sons of one’s youth. + 5 Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them. + They will not be put to shame, For they will speak with enemies in the city gate.
