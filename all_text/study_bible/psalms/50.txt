Psalm 50:1-23 A melody of Aʹsaph. + 50 The God of gods, Jehovah, * + has spoken; He summons the earth From the rising of the sun until its setting. * 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, + God shines forth. 3 Our God will come and cannot remain silent. + Before him is a consuming fire, + And a great storm rages all around him. + 4 He summons the heavens above and the earth, + So as to judge his people: + 5 “Gather to me my loyal ones, Those making a covenant with me over sacrifice.” + 6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, For God himself is Judge. + ( Selah ) 7 “Listen, O my people, and I will speak; Israel, I will bear witness against you. + I am God, your God. + 8 I do not reprove you because of your sacrifices, Nor because of your whole burnt offerings that are constantly before me. + 9 I do not need to take a bull from your house, Nor goats * from your pens. + 10 For every wild animal of the forest is mine, + Even the beasts upon a thousand mountains. 11 I know every bird of the mountains; + The countless animals of the field are mine. 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, For the productive land and everything in it is mine. + 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls And drink the blood of goats? + 14 Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God, + And pay your vows to the Most High; + 15 Call on me in the time of distress. + I will rescue you, and you will glorify me.” + 16 But God will say to the wicked: “What right do you have to relate my regulations + Or to speak about my covenant? + 17 For you hate discipline, * And you keep turning your back on my words. * + 18 When you see a thief, you approve of him, * + And you keep company with adulterers. 19 You use your mouth to spread what is bad, And deception is attached to your tongue. + 20 You sit and speak against your own brother; + You reveal the faults of * your own mother’s son. 21 When you did these things, I remained silent, So you thought that I would be just like you. But now I will reprove you, And I will state my case against you. + 22 Please consider this, you who forget God, + So that I may not tear you to pieces with no one to rescue you. 23 The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me, + And as for the one who follows a set course, I will cause him to see salvation by God.” + Footnotes ^ Or “The Divine One, God, Jehovah.” ^ Or “From east to west.” ^ Lit., “male goats.” ^ Lit., “throwing my words behind you.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Or possibly, “you join him.” ^ Or “defame.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
