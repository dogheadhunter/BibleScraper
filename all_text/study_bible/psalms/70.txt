Psalm 70:1-5 To the director. Of David, to serve as a reminder. * 70 O God, save me; O Jehovah, hurry to help me. + 2 May those seeking to take my life * Be put to shame and disgraced. May those who delight in my calamity Retreat in humiliation. 3 May those who are saying: “Aha! Aha!” Be driven back in shame. 4 But let those who are seeking you Exult and rejoice in you. + May those who love your acts of salvation always say: “May God be magnified!” 5 But I am helpless and poor; + O God, act quickly in my behalf. + You are my helper and my rescuer; + O Jehovah, do not delay. + Footnotes ^ Or “to bring to remembrance.” ^ Or “soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
