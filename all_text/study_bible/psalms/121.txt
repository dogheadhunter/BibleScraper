Psalm 121:1-8 A Song of the Ascents. 121 I raise my eyes to the mountains. + From where will my help come? 2 My help comes from Jehovah, + The Maker of heaven and earth. 3 He will never allow your foot to slip. * + The One guarding you will never be drowsy. 4 Look! He will never be drowsy nor go to sleep, The One guarding Israel. + 5 Jehovah is guarding you. Jehovah is the shade + at your right hand. + 6 By day the sun will not strike you, + Nor the moon by night. + 7 Jehovah will guard you against all harm. + He will guard your life. * + 8 Jehovah will guard you in all you do * From now on and forever.
