Psalm 120:1-7 A Song of the Ascents. * 120 I called to Jehovah in my distress, + And he answered me. + 2 O Jehovah, rescue me * from lying lips And from the deceitful tongue. 3 What will He do to you, and how will He punish you, * You deceitful tongue? + 4 With sharp arrows + of a warrior And burning coals + of broomwood. 5 Woe to me, for I have lived as a foreigner in Meʹshech! + I have been dwelling among the tents of Keʹdar. + 6 I have * been dwelling far too long With those who hate peace. + 7 I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war.
