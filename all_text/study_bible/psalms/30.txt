Psalm 30:1-12 A melody. A song of inauguration of the house. Of David. 30 I will exalt you, O Jehovah, for you have lifted * me up; You did not let my enemies rejoice over me. + 2 O Jehovah my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me. + 3 O Jehovah, you have lifted me * up from the Grave. * + You kept me alive; you spared me from sinking into the pit. * + 4 Sing praises * to Jehovah, you his loyal ones, + Give thanks to his holy name; * + 5 Because being under his anger is only for a moment, + But being in his favor * is for a lifetime. + Weeping may come in the evening, but in the morning, there is a joyful cry. + 6 When I was untroubled, I said: “I will never be shaken.” * 7 O Jehovah, while I was in your favor, * you made me as strong as a mountain. + But when you hid your face, I became terrified. + 8 To you, O Jehovah, I kept calling; + And to Jehovah, I kept pleading for favor. 9 What profit is there in my death, * in my going down to the pit? * + Will the dust praise you? + Will it tell of your faithfulness? + 10 Hear, O Jehovah, and show me favor. + O Jehovah, become my helper. + 11 You have changed my mourning into dancing; You have removed my sackcloth, and you clothe me with rejoicing, 12 So that I * may sing your praise and not keep silent. O Jehovah my God, I will praise you forever. Footnotes ^ Or “drawn.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
