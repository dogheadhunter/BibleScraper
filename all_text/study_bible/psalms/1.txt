Psalm 1:1-6 1 Happy is the man who does not walk according to the advice of the wicked And does not stand on the path of sinners + And does not sit in the seat of scoffers. + 2 But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, + And he reads His law in an undertone * day and night. + 3 He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, A tree that produces fruit in its season, The foliage of which does not wither. And everything he does will succeed. + 4 The wicked are not like that; They are like the chaff that the wind blows away. 5 That is why the wicked will not remain standing in the judgment; + Nor will sinners remain standing in the assembly of the righteous. + 6 For Jehovah is aware of the way of the righteous, + But the way of the wicked will perish. + Footnotes ^ Or “he meditates on His law.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
