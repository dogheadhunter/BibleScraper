Psalm 122:1-9 A Song of the Ascents. Of David. 122 I rejoiced when they said to me: “Let us go to the house of Jehovah.” + 2 And now our feet are standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem. + 3 Jerusalem is built as a city That is joined together as one. + 4 The tribes have gone up to it, The tribes of Jah, * According to the reminder to Israel, To give thanks to the name of Jehovah. + 5 For thrones for judgment were set up there, + Thrones of the house of David. + 6 Ask for the peace of Jerusalem. + Those who love you, O city, will be secure. 7 May peace continue within your ramparts, * Security within your fortified towers. 8 For the sake of my brothers and my companions I will say: “May there be peace within you.” 9 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God, + I will seek good for you.
