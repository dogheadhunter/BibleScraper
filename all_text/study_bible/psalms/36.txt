Psalm 36:1-12 To the director. Of Jehovah’s servant, David. 36 Transgression speaks to the wicked one deep within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes. + 2 For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much To detect and hate his error. + 3 The words of his mouth are hurtful and deceptive; He shows no insight for doing what is good. 4 He plots hurtful schemes even on his bed. He is set on a path that is not good; He does not reject what is bad. 5 O Jehovah, your loyal love reaches to the heavens, + Your faithfulness up to the clouds. 6 Your righteousness is like majestic mountains; * + Your judgments are like vast, deep waters. + Man and beast you preserve, * O Jehovah. + 7 How precious your loyal love is, O God! + In the shadow of your wings, the sons of men take refuge. + 8 They drink their fill of the rich bounty * of your house, + And you cause them to drink of the torrent of your delights. + 9 With you is the source of life; + By your light we can see light. + 10 Continue showing your loyal love to those who know you, + And your righteousness, to the upright in heart. + 11 Do not let the foot of the haughty tread on me Or the hand of the wicked drive me away. 12 There the wrongdoers have fallen; They have been knocked down and cannot get up. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “like mountains of God.” ^ Or “save.” ^ Lit., “the fatness.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
