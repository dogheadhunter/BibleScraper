Psalm 71:1-24 71 In you, O Jehovah, I have taken refuge. May I never be put to shame. + 2 In your righteousness save me and rescue me. Incline your ear * to me and save me. + 3 Become for me a rock fortress Where I can always enter. Give the command to save me, For you are my crag and my stronghold. + 4 O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked, + From the grasp of the unjust oppressor. 5 For you are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah; I have trusted in you * since my youth. + 6 I have depended on you from birth; It was you who took me from my mother’s womb. + I praise you constantly. 7 I have become like a miracle to many, But you are my strong refuge. 8 My mouth is filled with your praise; + All day long I tell about your splendor. 9 Do not cast me off in my old age; + Do not abandon me when my strength fails. + 10 My enemies speak against me, And those seeking to take my life * conspire together, + 11 Saying: “God has abandoned him. Chase after him and seize him, for there is no one to save him.” + 12 O God, do not remain far away from me. O my God, hurry to help me. + 13 May those who are resisting me * Be put to shame and perish. + May those seeking my calamity Be covered with disgrace and humiliation. + 14 But as for me, I will continue to wait; I will add to your praise. 15 My mouth will recount your righteousness, + All day long your acts of salvation, Though they are too many for me to grasp. * + 16 I will come and tell about your mighty acts, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah; I will mention your righteousness, yours alone. 17 O God, you have taught me from my youth, + And until now I keep declaring your wonderful works. + 18 Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me. + Let me tell the next generation about your power * And about your mightiness to all those who are to come. + 19 Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heights; + You have done great things; O God, who is like you? + 20 Though you have made me experience much distress and calamity, + Revive me again; Bring me up from the depths * of the earth. + 21 May you increase my greatness And surround and comfort me. 22 Then I will praise you on a stringed instrument Because of your faithfulness, O my God. + I will sing your praises * with the harp, O Holy One of Israel. 23 My lips will shout joyfully as I sing praises to you, + For you have saved my life. * + 24 My tongue will speak about * your righteousness all day long, + For those seeking my destruction will be ashamed and disgraced. + Footnotes ^ Or “Bend down and listen.” ^ Or “You are my confidence.” ^ Or “seeking my soul.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “number.” ^ Lit., “arm.” ^ Or “watery deeps.” ^ Or “make music to you.” ^ Or “redeemed my soul.” ^ Or “meditate on.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
