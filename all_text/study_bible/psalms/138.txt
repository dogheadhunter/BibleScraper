Psalm 138:1-8 Of David. 138 I will praise you with all my heart. + In the face of other gods, I will sing praises. * 2 I will bow down toward your holy temple, * + And I will praise your name + Because of your loyal love and your faithfulness. For you have magnified your saying and your name above everything else. * 3 On the day I called, you answered me; + You made me bold * and strong. + 4 All the kings of the earth will praise you, O Jehovah, + For they will have heard the promises you have spoken. 5 They will sing about the ways of Jehovah, For the glory of Jehovah is great. + 6 Though Jehovah is high, he takes note of the humble, + But the haughty he knows only from a distance. + 7 Even when I walk in the midst of danger, you will preserve me alive. + You stretch out your hand against the anger of my enemies; Your right hand will save me. 8 Jehovah will accomplish all things in my behalf. O Jehovah, your loyal love endures forever; + Do not forsake the works of your hands. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “In defiance of other gods, I will make music to you.” ^ Or “sanctuary.” ^ Or possibly, “you have magnified your saying above all your name.” ^ Or “bold in my soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
