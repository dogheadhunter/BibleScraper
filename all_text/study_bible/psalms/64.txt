Psalm 64:1-10 To the director. A melody of David. 64 Hear my voice, O God, as I plead. + Safeguard my life from the dreadfulness of the enemy. 2 Shield me from the secret plots of wicked men, + From the crowd of wrongdoers. 3 They sharpen their tongue just like a sword; They aim their cruel words like arrows, 4 To shoot at the innocent from their hiding places; They shoot at him suddenly, without fear. 5 They hold fast to their evil intent; * They discuss how to hide their traps. They say: “Who will see them?” + 6 They search out new ways of wrongdoing; They secretly devise their shrewd strategy; + The thinking within each one’s heart is unfathomable. 7 But God will shoot at them; + Suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow. 8 Their own tongue will cause their downfall; + All those looking on will shake their head. 9 Then all men will become afraid, And they will proclaim what God has done, And they will have insight into his deeds. + 10 The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in him; + All the upright in heart will exult. * Footnotes ^ Or “They encourage one another to do evil.” ^ Or “boast.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
