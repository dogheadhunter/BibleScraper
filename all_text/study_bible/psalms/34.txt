Psalm 34:1-22 Of David, when he disguised his sanity + before A·bimʹe·lech, who drove him away, and he left. א [ Aleph ] 34 I will praise Jehovah at all times; His praise will be on my lips constantly. ב [ Beth ] 2 I * will boast in Jehovah; + The meek will hear and rejoice. ג [ Gimel ] 3 Magnify Jehovah along with me; + Let us exalt his name together. ד [ Daleth ] 4 I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me. + He rescued me from all my fears. + ה [ He ] 5 Those who looked to him became radiant; Their faces could not be put to shame. ז [ Zayin ] 6 This lowly one called, and Jehovah heard. He saved him from all his distresses. + ח [ Heth ] 7 The angel of Jehovah camps all around those fearing Him, + And he rescues them. + ט [ Teth ] 8 Taste and see that Jehovah is good; + Happy is the man who takes refuge in him. י [ Yod ] 9 Fear Jehovah, all you his holy ones, For those who fear him lack nothing. + כ [ Kaph ] 10 Even strong young lions * have been reduced to hunger, But those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good. + ל [ Lamed ] 11 Come, my sons, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of Jehovah. + מ [ Mem ] 12 Who among you takes pleasure in life And would love to see many good days? + נ [ Nun ] 13 Then guard your tongue from what is bad, + Your lips from speaking deception. + ס [ Samekh ] 14 Turn away from what is bad and do what is good; + Seek peace and pursue it. + ע [ Ayin ] 15 The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, + And his ears listen to their cry for help. + פ [ Pe ] 16 But the face of Jehovah is against those doing what is bad, To erase all memory of them from the earth. + צ [ Tsade ] 17 They cried out, and Jehovah heard; + He rescued them from all their distresses. + ק [ Qoph ] 18 Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; + He saves those who are crushed in spirit. * + ר [ Resh ] 19 Many are the hardships * of the righteous one, + But Jehovah rescues him from them all. + ש [ Shin ] 20 He is guarding all his bones; Not one of them has been broken. + ת [ Taw ] 21 Disaster will put the wicked to death; Those hating the righteous will be found guilty. 22 Jehovah is redeeming the life * of his servants; None of those taking refuge in him will be found guilty. + Footnotes ^ Or “My soul.” ^ Or “maned young lions.” ^ Or “are discouraged.” ^ Or “calamities.” ^ Or “soul.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
