Psalm 57:1-11 To the director; set to “Do Not Bring to Ruin.” Of David. Mikʹtam. * When he ran away from Saul into the cave. + 57 Show me favor, O God, show me favor, For I take * refuge in you, + And in the shadow of your wings I take refuge until the troubles pass. + 2 I call to God the Most High, To the true God, who brings them to an end for me. 3 He will send help from heaven and save me. + He will frustrate the one snapping at me. ( Selah ) God will send his loyal love and his faithfulness. + 4 I am * surrounded by lions; + I must lie among men who want to devour me, Whose teeth are spears and arrows And whose tongue is a sharp sword. + 5 Be exalted above the heavens, O God; May your glory be over all the earth. + 6 They have prepared a net to ensnare my feet; + I am * bowed down with distress. + They have dug a pit ahead of me, But they fell into it themselves. + ( Selah ) 7 My heart is steadfast, O God, + My heart is steadfast. I will sing and make music. 8 Do awake, my glory. Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp. I will awaken the dawn. + 9 I will praise you among the peoples, O Jehovah; + I will sing praises * to you among the nations. + 10 For your loyal love is great, as high as the heavens, + And your faithfulness, up to the skies. 11 Be exalted above the heavens, O God; May your glory be over all the earth. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “my soul takes.” ^ Or “My soul is.” ^ Or “My soul is.” ^ Or “make music.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
