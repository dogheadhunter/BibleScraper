The First of Samuel 13:1-23 13 Saul was . . . * years old when he became king, + and for two years he reigned over Israel. 2 Saul chose 3,000 men out of Israel; 2,000 of these were with Saul at Michʹmash and in the mountainous region of Bethʹel and 1,000 were with Jonʹa·than + at Gibʹe·ah + of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people away, each one to his tent. 3 Then Jonʹa·than struck down the garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines + that was in Geʹba, + and the Phi·lisʹtines heard about it. And Saul had the horn blown + throughout all the land, saying: “Let the Hebrews hear!” 4 All Israel heard the news: “Saul has struck down a garrison of the Phi·lisʹtines, and now Israel has become a stench among the Phi·lisʹtines.” So the people were summoned to follow Saul at Gilʹgal. + 5 The Phi·lisʹtines also gathered together to fight against Israel, with 30,000 war chariots and 6,000 horsemen and troops as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore; + and they went up and camped in Michʹmash to the east of Beth-aʹven. + 6 And the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble, because they were hard-pressed; so the people hid in the caves, + the hollows, the crags, the cellars, * and the cisterns. 7 Some of the Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilʹe·ad. + But Saul was still in Gilʹgal, and all the people following him were trembling. 8 He continued waiting for seven days until the designated * time that Samuel had set, but Samuel did not come to Gilʹgal, and the people were scattering from him. 9 Finally Saul said: “Bring to me the burnt sacrifice and the communion sacrifices.” And he offered up the burnt sacrifice. + 10 But as soon as he had finished offering up the burnt sacrifice, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to meet him and bless him. 11 Then Samuel said: “What have you done?” Saul replied: “I saw that the people were deserting me, + and you did not come within the designated time, and the Phi·lisʹtines were gathering together at Michʹmash. + 12 So I said to myself, ‘Now the Phi·lisʹtines will come down against me at Gilʹgal, and I have not sought the favor * of Jehovah.’ So I felt obligated to offer up the burnt sacrifice.” 13 At this Samuel said to Saul: “You have acted foolishly. You have not obeyed the commandment that Jehovah your God gave you. + If you had, Jehovah would have made your kingdom firm over Israel forever. 14 But now your kingdom will not last. + Jehovah will find a man agreeable to his heart, + and Jehovah will commission him as a leader over his people, + because you did not obey what Jehovah commanded you.” + 15 Then Samuel rose and went his way up from Gilʹgal to Gibʹe·ah of Benjamin, and Saul took the count of the people; those still with him were about 600 men. + 16 Saul, his son Jonʹa·than, and the people still with them were dwelling in Geʹba + of Benjamin, and the Phi·lisʹtines had encamped at Michʹmash. + 17 And the raiding parties would go out from the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines in three bands. One band would turn toward the road to Ophʹrah, to the land of Shuʹal; 18 another band would turn toward the road of Beth-hoʹron; + and the third band would turn toward the road leading to the boundary that overlooks the valley of Ze·boʹim, toward the wilderness. 19 Now there was not a metalworker to be found in all the land of Israel, because the Phi·lisʹtines had said: “So that the Hebrews may not make a sword or a spear.” 20 And all the Israelites had to go down to the Phi·lisʹtines to get their plowshares, mattocks, axes, or sickles sharpened. 21 The price for sharpening was a pim * for the plowshares, for the mattocks, for the three-toothed instruments, for the axes, and for fixing fast the oxgoad. 22 And on the day of battle, not a sword or a spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonʹa·than; + only Saul and his son Jonʹa·than had weapons. 23 Now a garrison * of the Phi·lisʹtines had gone out to the ravine pass of Michʹmash. + Footnotes ^ The number is missing in the Hebrew text. ^ Or “vaults.” ^ Or “appointed.” ^ Or “softened the face.” ^ An ancient weight, approximately two thirds of a shekel. ^ Or “an outpost.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
