Zechariah 10:1-12 10 “Ask Jehovah for rain in the time of the spring rain. It is Jehovah who makes the storm clouds, Who pours rain for them, + And gives vegetation in the field to everyone. 2 For the teraphim statues * have spoken deception; * And the diviners have visioned a lie. They speak about worthless dreams, And in vain they try to comfort. That is why they will wander like sheep. They will suffer, for there is no shepherd. 3 Against the shepherds my anger burns, And against the oppressive leaders * I will hold an accounting; For Jehovah of armies has turned his attention to his flock, + to the house of Judah, And he has made them like his majestic horse in the battle. 4 From him comes the keyman, * From him comes the supporting ruler, * From him comes the battle bow; From him goes forth every overseer, * all of them together. 5 And they will become like warriors, Trampling down the mud of the streets in the battle. They will wage war, for Jehovah is with them; + And the riders of horses will be put to shame. + 6 I will make the house of Judah superior, And the house of Joseph I will save. + I will restore them, For I will show them mercy; + And they will be as though I had never cast them off; + For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them. 7 Those of Eʹphra·im must become like a mighty warrior, And their heart will rejoice as though from wine. + Their sons will see this and rejoice; Their heart will be joyful in Jehovah. + 8 ‘I will whistle for them and gather them together; For I will redeem them, + and they will become many, And continue to be many. 9 Though I scatter them like seed among the peoples, They will remember me in the distant places; With their sons they will revive and return. 10 I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from As·syrʹi·a; + I will bring them to the land of Gilʹe·ad + and Lebʹa·non, And there will be no more room for them. + 11 He must pass through the sea with distress; And in the sea he will strike down the waves; + All the depths of the Nile will dry up. The pride of As·syrʹi·a will be brought down, And the scepter of Egypt will depart. + 12 I will make them superior in Jehovah, + And they will walk about in his name,’ + declares Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Or “household gods; idols.” ^ Or “what is uncanny; what is mystical.” ^ Lit., “the he-goats.” ^ Lit., “the corner tower,” pictorial of a vital or important man; a chief. ^ Lit., “the peg,” pictorial of one who is a support; a ruler. ^ Or “taskmaster.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
