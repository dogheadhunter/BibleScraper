Zechariah 4:1-14 4 The angel who had been speaking with me came back and woke me up, as when waking someone from sleep. 2 Then he said to me: “What do you see?” So I said: “I see, and look! a lampstand entirely of gold, + with a bowl on top of it. There are seven lamps on it, + yes, seven, and the lamps, which are at the top of it, have seven pipes. 3 And next to it are two olive trees, + one on the right of the bowl and one on the left.” 4 Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me: “What do these things mean, my lord?” 5 So the angel who was speaking with me asked: “Do you not know what these things mean?” I replied: “No, my lord.” 6 He then said to me: “This is the word of Jehovah to Ze·rubʹba·bel: ‘“Not by a military force, nor by power, + but by my spirit,” + says Jehovah of armies. 7 Who are you, O great mountain? Before Ze·rubʹba·bel + you will become a level land. * + And he will bring out the top stone * amid shouts of: “How wonderful! How wonderful!”’” 8 The word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 9 “The hands of Ze·rubʹba·bel have laid the foundation of this house, + and his own hands will finish it. + And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. 10 For who has despised the day of small beginnings? * + For they will rejoice and see the plumb line * in the hand of Ze·rubʹba·bel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah, which are roving about in all the earth.” + 11 Then I asked him: “What is the meaning of these two olive trees on the right and on the left of the lampstand?” + 12 I asked him a second time: “What is the meaning of the two bunches of twigs * of the olive trees that are pouring out the golden liquid through the two golden tubes?” 13 So he asked me: “Do you not know what these things mean?” I replied: “No, my lord.” 14 He said: “These are the two anointed ones who are standing alongside the Lord of the whole earth.” + Footnotes ^ Or “the capstone.” ^ Or “a plain.” ^ Or “small things?” ^ Lit., “the stone, the tin.” ^ That is, fruit-laden twigs of the tree.
