Zechariah 9:1-17 9 A pronouncement: “The word of Jehovah is against the land of Haʹdrach, And Damascus is its target * + —For Jehovah’s eye is on mankind + And on all the tribes of Israel— 2 And against Haʹmath, + which borders on her, And against Tyre + and Siʹdon, + for they are so wise. + 3 Tyre built herself a rampart. * She piled up silver like dust And gold like the dirt of the streets. + 4 Look! Jehovah will take away her possessions, And he will strike down her army into the sea; * + And she will be consumed in the fire. + 5 Ashʹke·lon will see it and be afraid; Gazʹa will feel great anguish, Also Ekʹron, because her hope is put to shame. A king will perish from Gazʹa, And Ashʹke·lon will not be inhabited. + 6 An illegitimate son will settle in Ashʹdod, And I will do away with the pride of the Phi·lisʹtine. + 7 I will remove the bloodstained things from his mouth And the disgusting things from between his teeth, And he will be left remaining for our God; And he will become like a sheikh * in Judah, + And Ekʹron like the Jebʹu·site. + 8 I will encamp as a guard * for my house, + So that there will be no one passing through and no one returning; And no taskmaster * will pass through again, + For now I have seen it * with my eyes. 9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion. Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem. Look! Your king is coming to you. + He is righteous, bringing salvation, * Humble + and riding on a donkey, On a colt, * the foal of a female donkey. + 10 I will take away the war chariot from Eʹphra·im And the horse from Jerusalem. The battle bow will be taken away. And he will proclaim peace to the nations; + His rulership will be from sea to sea And from the River * to the ends of the earth. + 11 As for you, O woman, by the blood of your covenant, I will send your prisoners out of the waterless pit. + 12 Return to the stronghold, you prisoners with hope. + Today I am telling you, ‘I will repay to you, O woman, a double portion. + 13 For I will bend * Judah as my bow. The bow I will fill with Eʹphra·im, * And I will awaken your sons, O Zion, Against your sons, O Greece, And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.’ 14 Jehovah will be seen over them, And his arrow will go out like lightning. The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will sound the horn, + And he will advance with the windstorms of the south. 15 Jehovah of armies will defend them, And they will devour and subdue the slingstones. + They will drink and be boisterous, as if with wine; And they will be filled like the bowl, Like the corners of the altar. + 16 Jehovah their God will save them in that day As the flock of his people; + For they will be like the gemstones of a crown * glittering over his soil. + 17 For how great his goodness is, + And how great his handsomeness is! Grain will make the young men thrive, And new wine the virgins.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “resting-place.” ^ Or “fortress.” ^ Or possibly, “on the sea.” ^ A sheikh was a tribal chief. ^ Evidently, the affliction of his people. ^ Or “oppressor.” ^ Or “an outpost.” ^ Or “and victorious; and saved.” ^ Or “a male donkey.” ^ That is, the Euphrates. ^ Lit., “tread.” ^ That is, like an arrow. ^ Or “diadem.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
