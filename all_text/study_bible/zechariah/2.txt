Zechariah 2:1-13 2 And I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line + in his hand. 2 So I asked: “Where are you going?” He replied: “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is her width and what is her length.” + 3 And look! the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came to meet him. 4 Then he said to him: “Run over there and tell that young man, ‘“Jerusalem will be inhabited + as open rural country, * because of all the men and livestock within her. + 5 And I will become to her,” declares Jehovah, “a wall of fire all around, + and I will become the glory in her midst.”’” + 6 “Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” + declares Jehovah. “For I have scattered you to the four winds of the heavens,” + declares Jehovah. 7 “Come, Zion! Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon. + 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified * has sent me to the nations that were plundering you: + ‘Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye. * + 9 For now I will wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves.’ + And you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me. 10 “Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion; + for I am coming, + and I will reside in your midst,” + declares Jehovah. 11 “Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, + and they will become my people; and I will reside in your midst.” And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. 12 Jehovah will take possession of Judah as his portion on the holy ground, and he will again choose Jerusalem. + 13 Be silent, all flesh, * before Jehovah, for he is taking action from his holy dwelling.
