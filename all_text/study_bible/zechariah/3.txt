Zechariah 3:1-10 3 And he showed me Joshua + the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan + was standing at his right hand to resist him. 2 Then the angel of Jehovah said to Satan: “May Jehovah rebuke you, O Satan, + yes, may Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, + rebuke you! Is not this one a burning log snatched out of the fire?” 3 Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel. 4 The angel said to those standing before him, “Remove his filthy garments.” Then he said to him, “See, I have caused your error * to pass away from you, and you will be clothed with fine garments.” * + 5 So I said: “Let a clean turban be put on his head.” + And they put the clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of Jehovah was standing nearby. 6 The angel of Jehovah then declared to Joshua: 7 “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘If you will walk in my ways and carry out your responsibilities before me, then you will serve as a judge in my house + and take care of * my courtyards; and I will give you free access among these who are standing here.’ 8 “‘Hear, please, O High Priest Joshua, you and your companions who sit before you, for these men serve as a sign; look! I am bringing in my servant + Sprout! + 9 See the stone that I have set before Joshua! On the one stone are seven eyes; and I am engraving an inscription on it,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘and I will take away the guilt of that land in one day.’ + 10 “‘In that day,’ declares Jehovah of armies, ‘each of you will invite your neighbor to come under your vine and under your fig tree.’” + Footnotes ^ Or “guilt.” ^ Or “with robes of state.” ^ Or “have charge of; guard.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
