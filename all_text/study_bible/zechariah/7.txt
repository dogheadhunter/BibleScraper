Zechariah 7:1-14 7 And in the fourth year of King Da·riʹus, the word of Jehovah came to Zech·a·riʹah + on the fourth day of the ninth month, that is, the month of Chisʹlev. * 2 The people of Bethʹel sent Shar·eʹzer and Reʹgem-melʹech and his men to beg for the favor * of Jehovah, 3 saying to the priests of the house * of Jehovah of armies and to the prophets: “Should I weep in the fifth month + and abstain from food, as I have done for so many years?” 4 The word of Jehovah of armies again came to me, saying: 5 “Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, ‘When you fasted and wailed in the fifth month and in the seventh month + for 70 years, + did you really fast for me? 6 And when you would eat and drink, were you not eating for yourselves and drinking for yourselves? 7 Should you not obey the words that Jehovah proclaimed through the former prophets, + while Jerusalem and her surrounding cities were inhabited and at peace, and while the Negʹeb and the She·pheʹlah were inhabited?’” 8 The word of Jehovah again came to Zech·a·riʹah, saying: 9 “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘Judge with true justice, + and deal with one another in loyal love + and mercy. 10 Do not defraud the widow or the fatherless child, * + the foreigner + or the poor; + and do not scheme evil against one another in your hearts.’ + 11 But they kept refusing to pay attention, + and they stubbornly turned their backs, + and they stopped up their ears so as not to hear. + 12 They made their heart like a diamond * + and would not obey the law * and the words that Jehovah of armies sent by his spirit through the former prophets. + So there came great indignation from Jehovah of armies.” + 13 “‘Just as they did not listen when I * called, + so I would not listen when they called,’ + says Jehovah of armies. 14 ‘And I scattered them with a storm wind throughout all the nations that they had not known, + and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one passing through or returning; + for they turned the desirable land into an object of horror.’” Footnotes ^ See App. B15 . ^ Or “soften the face.” ^ Or “temple.” ^ Or “the orphan.” ^ Or possibly, “a hard stone,” such as an emery stone. ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Lit., “he.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
