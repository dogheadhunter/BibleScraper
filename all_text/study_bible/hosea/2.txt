Hosea 2:1-23 2 “Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’ * + And to your sisters, ‘O woman shown mercy!’ * + 2 Accuse your mother; accuse her, For she is not my wife + and I am not her husband. She should remove her prostitution * from herself And her adultery from between her breasts, 3 Or I will strip her naked and make her as in the day she was born, Making her like a wilderness, Reducing her to a waterless land, And causing her to die of thirst. 4 And to her sons I will not show mercy, For they are the sons of prostitution. * 5 For their mother has committed prostitution. * + She who was pregnant with them has acted shamefully, + for she said, ‘I will go after my passionate lovers, + Those who give me my bread and my water, My wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.’ 6 So I will block your way with a hedge of thorns; And I will raise up a stone wall against her, So that she cannot find her paths. 7 She will chase after her passionate lovers, but she will not overtake them; + She will look for them, but she will not find them. Then she will say, ‘I will go back to my first husband, + For I was better off at that time than I am now.’ + 8 She did not recognize that it was I who had given her the grain, + the new wine, and the oil, And I who had given her silver in abundance And gold, which they used for Baʹal. + 9 ‘Therefore, I will return and take away my grain in its time And my new wine in its season, + And I will snatch away my wool and my linen that were to cover her nakedness. 10 Now I will expose her private parts in full view of her passionate lovers, And no man will rescue her out of my hand. + 11 I will put an end to all her joy, Her festivals, + her new moons, her sabbaths, and all her festive seasons. 12 And I will ruin her vines and her fig trees, of which she has said: “These are my wages, which my passionate lovers gave to me”; I will turn them into a forest, And the wild animals of the field will devour them. 13 I will hold an accounting against her for the days when she offered sacrifices to the Baʹal images, + When she would adorn herself with her rings and ornaments and would chase after her passionate lovers, And I was the one she forgot,’ + declares Jehovah. 14 ‘So I will persuade her, I will lead her into the wilderness, And I will speak to win her heart. 15 I will give her vineyards back to her from that time onward, + And the Valley * of Aʹchor + as a gateway to hope; She will answer there as in the days of her youth, As in the day when she came out of the land of Egypt. + 16 And in that day,’ declares Jehovah, ‘You will call me My husband, and you will no longer call me My master.’ * 17 ‘I will remove the names of the Baʹal images from her mouth, + And they will no longer be remembered by their name. + 18 In that day I will make a covenant for them with the wild animals of the field, + And with the birds of the heavens and the creeping things of the ground; + I will rid the land of the bow and the sword and war, + And I will make them lie down * in security. + 19 I will engage myself to you forever; And I will engage myself to you in righteousness and in justice, In loyal love and in mercy. + 20 I will engage myself to you in faithfulness, And you will certainly know Jehovah.’ + 21 ‘In that day I will answer,’ declares Jehovah, ‘I will answer the heavens, And they will answer the earth; + 22 And the earth will answer the grain and the new wine and the oil; And they will answer Jezʹre·el. * + 23 I will sow her like seed for myself in the earth, + And I will show mercy to her who was not shown mercy; * I will say to those not my people: * “You are my people,” + And they will say: “You are my God.”’” + Footnotes ^ See Ho 1:9 ftn. ^ See Ho 1:6 ftn. ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “engaged in immorality (promiscuity).” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Or “My Baal.” ^ Or “let them live.” ^ Meaning “God Will Sow Seed.” ^ See Ho 1:6 ftn. ^ See Ho 1:9 ftn.
