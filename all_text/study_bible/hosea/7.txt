Hosea 7:1-16 7 “At the time when I would heal Israel, The error of Eʹphra·im is also exposed, + And the wickedness of Sa·marʹi·a. + For they practice deception; + Thieves break in and marauder bands raid outside. + 2 But they do not say in their heart that I will remember all their wickedness. + Now their dealings are all around them; They are right in front of my face. 3 They make the king rejoice by their wickedness, And princes by their deceit. 4 All of them are adulterers, Burning like an oven fired by a baker, Who stops stirring the fire after kneading the dough until it is leavened. 5 On the day of our king, princes have become sick —They are enraged because of wine. + He has reached out his hand to ridiculers. 6 For they approach with hearts burning like an oven. * All night long the baker sleeps; In the morning the oven blazes like a flaming fire. 7 All of them are hot like an oven, And they devour their rulers. * All their kings have fallen; + No one among them calls out to me. + 8 Eʹphra·im mixes with the nations. + Eʹphra·im is like a round cake left unturned. 9 Strangers have consumed his strength, + but he does not know it. And his gray hairs have turned white, but he does not notice it. 10 The pride of Israel has testified against him, + But they have not returned to Jehovah their God, + Nor have they looked for him despite all of this. 11 Eʹphra·im is like a simpleminded dove, lacking good sense. * + They have called out to Egypt; + they have gone to As·syrʹi·a. + 12 Wherever they go, I will spread my net over them. I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens. I will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly. + 13 Woe to them, for they have fled from me! Devastation to them, for they have transgressed against me! I was ready to redeem them, but they have spoken lies against me. + 14 From their heart they did not call to me for help, + Although they kept wailing on their beds. For their grain and new wine they would slash themselves; They turn against me. 15 Although I disciplined them and strengthened their arms, They are against me, scheming what is bad. 16 They changed course, but not to anything loftier; * They were as unreliable as a loose bow. + Their princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues. For this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of Egypt.” + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “For their hearts are like an oven as they approach with their intrigues.” ^ Lit., “judges.” ^ Lit., “without heart.” ^ That is, not to an elevated form of worship.
