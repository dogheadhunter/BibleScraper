Hosea 5:1-15 5 “Hear this, you priests, + Pay attention, O house of Israel, Listen, O house of the king, For the judgment involves you; Because you are a trap to Mizʹpah And a net spread over Taʹbor. + 2 And those falling away * have sunk deep * in slaughter, And I am warning * all of them. 3 I know Eʹphra·im, And Israel is not hidden from me. For now, O Eʹphra·im, you have acted promiscuously; * Israel has defiled itself. + 4 Their dealings do not permit them to return to their God, Because there is a spirit of prostitution * among them; + And Jehovah they do not acknowledge. 5 The pride of Israel has testified against him; * + Both Israel and Eʹphra·im have stumbled in their error, And Judah has stumbled with them. + 6 With their flock and their herd they went to look for Jehovah, But they could not find him. He had drawn away from them. + 7 They have betrayed Jehovah, + For they have fathered foreign sons. Now a month will devour them * and their portions. * 8 Blow a horn + in Gibʹe·ah, a trumpet in Raʹmah! + Shout a war cry at Beth-aʹven + —after you, O Benjamin! 9 O Eʹphra·im, you will become an object of horror in the day of punishment. + I have made known what will surely happen among the tribes of Israel. 10 The princes of Judah are like those moving a boundary. + I will pour out my fury on them like water. 11 Eʹphra·im is oppressed, crushed by judgment, For he was determined to follow after his adversary. + 12 So I was like a moth to Eʹphra·im And like rottenness to the house of Judah. 13 When Eʹphra·im saw his sickness, and Judah his ulcer, Eʹphra·im went to As·syrʹi·a + and sent to a great king. But he was unable to heal you, And he could not cure your ulcer. 14 For I will be like a young lion to Eʹphra·im, And like a strong lion * to the house of Judah. I myself will tear to pieces and go away; + I will carry them off, and no one will rescue them. + 15 I will go away and return to my place until they bear the consequences of their guilt, And then they will seek my favor. * + When they are in distress, they will seek me.” + Footnotes ^ Or “the rebels.” ^ Or “have been deeply involved.” ^ Or “I will discipline.” ^ Or “have acted immorally; have engaged in prostitution.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Lit., “to his face.” ^ Or possibly, “Within a month they will be devoured.” ^ Or “fields.” ^ Or “a maned young lion.” ^ Lit., “face.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
