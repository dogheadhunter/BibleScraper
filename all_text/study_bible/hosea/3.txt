Hosea 3:1-5 3 Then Jehovah said to me: “Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery, + just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel + while they turn to other gods + and love raisin cakes.” * 2 So I purchased her for myself for 15 silver pieces and a hoʹmer measure * and a half of barley. 3 Then I said to her: “You will remain mine for many days. You must not commit prostitution, * and you must not have relations with another man, and I will behave the same way toward you.” * 4 It is because for a long time * the people of Israel will dwell without a king, + without a prince, without a sacrifice, without a pillar, and without an ephʹod + and teraphim statues. * + 5 Afterward the people of Israel will come back and look for Jehovah their God + and for David their king, + and they will come trembling to Jehovah and to his goodness in the final part of the days. + Footnotes ^ That is, those used in false worship. ^ A homer equaled 220 L (200 dry qt).
