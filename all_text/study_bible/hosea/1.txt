Hosea 1:1-11 1 The word of Jehovah that came to Ho·seʹa * the son of Be·eʹri in the days of Uz·ziʹah, + Joʹtham, + Aʹhaz, + and Hez·e·kiʹah, + kings of Judah, + and in the days of Jer·o·boʹam + son of Joʹash, + the king of Israel. 2 When Jehovah started to speak his word through Ho·seʹa, Jehovah said to Ho·seʹa: “Go, marry a woman of prostitution * and have children of prostitution, * because by prostitution * the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.” + 3 So he went and married Goʹmer the daughter of Dib·laʹim, and she conceived and bore him a son. 4 Then Jehovah said to him: “Name him Jezʹre·el, * for in a little while I will hold an accounting against the house of Jeʹhu + for the acts of bloodshed of Jezʹre·el, and I will put an end to the royal rule of the house of Israel. + 5 In that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley * of Jezʹre·el.” 6 She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And He told him: “Name her Lo-ru·haʹmah, * for I will no longer show mercy + to the house of Israel, because I will certainly drive them away. + 7 But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, + and I will save them by Jehovah their God; + I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.” + 8 After weaning Lo-ru·haʹmah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. 9 Then He said: “Name him Lo-amʹmi, * because you are not my people and I will not be yours. 10 “And the number of the people * of Israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. + And in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ + it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’ + 11 And the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together into unity + and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezʹre·el. + Footnotes ^ Shortened form of Hoshaiah, which means “Saved by Jah; Jah Has Saved.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Meaning “God Will Sow Seed.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Meaning “Not Shown Mercy.” ^ Meaning “Not My People.” ^ Lit., “sons.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
