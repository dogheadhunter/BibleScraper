Hosea 14:1-9 14 “Come back, O Israel, to Jehovah your God, + For you have stumbled because of your error. 2 Come back to Jehovah with these words, Say to him, ‘May you pardon our error + and accept what is good, And we will offer the praise of our lips + as we would young bulls. * 3 As·syrʹi·a will not save us. + We will not ride on horses, + And we will no longer say, “O our God!” to the work of our hands, For it is by you that the fatherless child is shown mercy.’ + 4 I will heal their unfaithfulness. + I will love them of my own free will, + Because my anger has turned away from him. + 5 I will become like the dew to Israel; He will blossom like the lily And will send down his roots like the trees of Lebʹa·non. 6 His twigs will spread, His splendor will be like that of the olive tree, And his fragrance like that of Lebʹa·non. 7 They will again dwell in his shadow. They will grow grain and will bud like the vine. + His fame * will be like the wine of Lebʹa·non. 8 Eʹphra·im will say, ‘What more do I have to do with idols?’ + I will answer and watch over him. + I will be like a thriving juniper tree. From me your fruit will be found.” 9 Who is wise? Let him understand these things. Who is discreet? Let him know them. For the ways of Jehovah are upright, + And the righteous will walk in them; But the transgressors will stumble in them.
