Hosea 11:1-12 11 “When Israel was a boy, I loved him, + And out of Egypt I called my son. + 2 The more they * called them, The more they went away from them. + They kept sacrificing to the Baʹal images + And offering sacrifices to the graven images. + 3 But it was I who taught Eʹphra·im to walk, + taking them in my arms; + And they did not acknowledge that I had healed them. 4 With the ropes of men * I kept drawing them, with the cords of love; + And I was to them like one lifting a yoke from their jaws, And I gently brought food to each one. 5 They will not return to the land of Egypt, but As·syrʹi·a will be their king, + Because they refused to return to me. + 6 And a sword will whirl against his cities + And destroy his bars and devour them because of their schemes. + 7 My people are bent on unfaithfulness to me. + Though they called them upward, * no one rises up. 8 How can I give you up, O Eʹphra·im? + How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I treat you like Adʹmah? How can I make you like Ze·boiʹim? + I have had a change of heart; At the same time my compassions are stirred. * + 9 I will not vent my burning anger. I will not destroy Eʹphra·im again, + For I am God and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come against you in fury. 10 They will walk after Jehovah, and he will roar like a lion; + When he roars, his sons will come trembling from the west. + 11 They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt, Like a dove out of the land of As·syrʹi·a; + And I will settle them in their houses,” declares Jehovah. + 12 “Eʹphra·im has surrounded me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit. + But Judah still roams * with God, And he is faithful to the Most Holy One.” + Footnotes ^ That is, prophets and others sent to instruct Israel. ^ Or “the ropes of kindness,” like those of a parent. ^ That is, to an elevated form of worship. ^ Lit., “have grown hot.” ^ Or “walks.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
