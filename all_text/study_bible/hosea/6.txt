Hosea 6:1-11 6 “Come, and let us return to Jehovah, For he has torn us to pieces, + but he will heal us. He struck us, but he will bind our wounds. 2 He will revive us after two days. On the third day he will raise us up, And we will live before him. 3 We will know, we will earnestly seek to know Jehovah. His going out is as certain as the dawn; He will come to us like a pouring rain, Like a spring rain that saturates the earth.” 4 “What should I do with you, Eʹphra·im? What should I do with you, Judah? For your loyal love is like the morning clouds, Like the dew that quickly vanishes. 5 That is why I will cut them down by means of the prophets; + I will kill them with the words of my mouth. + And the judgments on you will shine as the light. + 6 For in loyal love * I delight, not in sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God, rather than in whole burnt offerings. + 7 But they, like mere men, have violated the covenant. + There they have betrayed me. 8 Gilʹe·ad is a town of evildoers, + Covered with footprints of blood. + 9 The company of priests are like marauder bands lying in ambush for a man. They murder on the road at Sheʹchem, + For their conduct is shameful. 10 I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Eʹphra·im practices prostitution; + Israel has defiled itself. + 11 Furthermore, O Judah, a harvest is set for you, When I gather back the captives of my people.” + Footnotes ^ Or “in mercy.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
