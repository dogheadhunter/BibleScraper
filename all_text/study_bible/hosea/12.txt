Hosea 12:1-14 12 “Eʹphra·im is feeding on wind. He chases after the east wind all day long. He multiplies lies and violence. They make a covenant with As·syrʹi·a + and take oil to Egypt. + 2 Jehovah has a legal case against Judah; + He will call for an accounting against Jacob according to his ways, And he will repay him according to his deeds. + 3 In the womb he seized his brother by the heel, + And with his vigor he contended with God. + 4 He kept contending with an angel and prevailed. He wept and begged for his favor.” + He found him at Bethʹel, and there He spoke with us, + 5 Jehovah the God of armies, + Jehovah is his memorial name. * + 6 “So return to your God, + Maintain loyal love and justice, + And always hope in your God. 7 But in the hand of the tradesman * are deceptive scales; He loves to defraud. + 8 Eʹphra·im keeps saying, ‘Indeed, I have become rich; + I have found wealth. + And in all my toil, they will not find anything wrong or sinful.’ 9 But I am Jehovah your God from * the land of Egypt. + I will again make you dwell in tents As in the days of an appointed time. * 10 I spoke to the prophets, + I multiplied their visions, And I spoke parables through the prophets. 11 With Gilʹe·ad there has been deception * + and untruth. In Gilʹgal they have sacrificed bulls, + And their altars are like piles of stones in the furrows of the field. + 12 Jacob ran away to the territory * of Aʹram; * + Israel + served there for a wife, + And for a wife he guarded sheep. + 13 By a prophet Jehovah brought Israel up from Egypt, + And by a prophet he was guarded. + 14 Eʹphra·im has caused bitter offense; + His bloodguilt remains on him; His Lord will repay him for his reproach.” + Footnotes ^ Or “is the name by which he is remembered.” ^ Or “merchant.” ^ Or possibly, “a festival.” ^ Or “since.” ^ Or “what is uncanny; what is mystical.” ^ Lit., “field.” ^ Or “Syria.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
