Zephaniah 3:1-20 3 Woe to the rebellious, the polluted, the oppressive city! + 2 She has obeyed no voice; + she has accepted no discipline. + In Jehovah she has not trusted; + she has not drawn near to her God. + 3 Her princes within her are roaring lions. + Her judges are wolves in the night; They do not leave even a bone to gnaw until morning. 4 Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men. + Her priests defile what is holy; + They do violence to the law. + 5 Jehovah is righteous in her midst; + he does no wrong. Morning by morning he makes known his judgments, + As unfailing as the daylight. But the unrighteous one knows no shame. + 6 “I destroyed nations; their corner towers were left desolate. I devastated their streets, so that no one was passing through. Their cities were left in ruins, without a man, without an inhabitant. + 7 I said, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept discipline,’ * + So that her dwelling place might not be destroyed + —I must call her to account for * all these things. But they were all the more eager to act corruptly. + 8 ‘So keep yourselves in expectation of * me,’ + declares Jehovah, ‘Until the day when I rise up to take plunder, * For my judicial decision is to gather nations, to assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them my indignation, all my burning anger; + For by the fire of my zeal the whole earth will be consumed. + 9 For then I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language, So that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah, To serve him shoulder to shoulder.’ * + 10 From the region of the rivers of E·thi·oʹpi·a, Those entreating me, the daughter of my scattered ones, will bring a gift to me. + 11 On that day you will not be put to shame Because of all your deeds with which you rebelled against me, + For then I will remove the haughty boasters from among you; And you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain. + 12 I will allow a humble and lowly people to remain in your midst, + And they will take refuge in the name of Jehovah. 13 Those remaining of Israel + will practice no unrighteousness; + They will not speak a lie, nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths; They will feed * and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.” + 14 Shout joyfully, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O Israel! + Be joyful and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! + 15 Jehovah has removed the judgments against you. + He has turned away your enemy. + The King of Israel, Jehovah, is in your midst. + You will fear calamity no more. + 16 On that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, O Zion. + Do not let your hands drop down. 17 Jehovah your God is in your midst. + As a mighty One, he will save. He will exult over you with great joy. + He will become silent * in his love. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. 18 I will gather together those grieving over their absence from your festivals; + They were absent from you because of bearing reproach for her. + 19 Look! At that time I will act against all those oppressing you; + And I will save the one limping, + And I will gather together the dispersed. + I will make them an object of praise and fame * In all the land of their shame. 20 At that time I will bring you in, At the time I gather you together. For I will make you an object of fame * and praise + among all the peoples of the earth, When I gather back your captives before your eyes,” says Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or “punish her for.” ^ Or “correction.” ^ Or “wait patiently for.” ^ Or possibly, “rise up as a witness.” ^ Or “worship him in unity.” ^ Or “graze.” ^ Or “quiet; at ease; satisfied.” ^ Lit., “a name.” ^ Lit., “a name.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
