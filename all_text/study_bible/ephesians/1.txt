To the Ephesians 1:1-23 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through God’s will, to the holy ones who are in Ephʹe·sus + and are faithful in union with Christ Jesus: 2 May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 3 Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for he has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in union with Christ, + 4 as he chose us to be in union with him before the founding of the world, that we should be holy and unblemished + before him in love. 5 For he foreordained us + to be adopted as his own sons + through Jesus Christ, according to his good pleasure and will, + 6 in praise of his glorious undeserved kindness + that he kindly bestowed on us by means of his beloved one. + 7 By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, + yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, + according to the riches of his undeserved kindness. 8 This undeserved kindness he caused to abound toward us in all wisdom and understanding * 9 by making known to us the sacred secret + of his will. It is according to his good pleasure that he himself purposed 10 for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, to gather all things together in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. + Yes, in him 11 with whom we are in union and were assigned as heirs, + having been foreordained according to the purpose of the one who accomplishes all things as he decides according to his will, + 12 so that we who have been first to hope * in the Christ should serve for the praise of his glory. 13 But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. After you believed, you were sealed + by means of him with the promised holy spirit, 14 which is a token in advance of our inheritance, + for the purpose of releasing God’s own possession + by a ransom, + to his glorious praise. 15 That is why I also, since I have heard of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and the love that you demonstrate toward all the holy ones, 16 never stop giving thanks for you. I continue mentioning you in my prayers, + 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the accurate knowledge of him. + 18 He has enlightened the eyes of your heart, so that you may know to what hope he called you, what glorious riches he holds as an inheritance for the holy ones, + 19 and how surpassing the greatness of his power is toward us believers. + It is according to the operation of the mightiness of his strength, 20 which he exercised toward Christ when he raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand + in the heavenly places, 21 far above every government and authority and power and lordship + and every name that is named, + not only in this system of things but also in that to come. 22 He also subjected all things under his feet + and made him head over all things with regard to the congregation, + 23 which is his body, + the fullness of him who fills up all things in all. Footnotes ^ Or “insight; good sense.” ^ Or “we who have hoped beforehand.” Study Notes The First to the Corinthians: Titles like this were apparently not part of the original text. Ancient manuscripts show that they were added later, doubtless to make it easier to identify the letters. The papyrus codex known as P 46 shows that scribes identified Bible books by titles. That codex is the earliest known collection of Paul’s letters, often dated to about the year 200 C.E. It contains nine of his letters. At the beginning of Paul’s first inspired letter to the Corinthians, this codex has a title that reads Pros Ko·rinʹthi·ous A (“Toward [or, “To”] Corinthians 1”). (See Media Gallery, “ Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians .”) Other early manuscripts, such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus of the fourth century C.E., contain the same title. In these manuscripts, the title appears both at the beginning of the letter and at the end. To the Ephesians: Titles like this were apparently not part of the original text. Ancient manuscripts show that they were added later, doubtless to make it easy to identify the books.​—See study note on 1Co Title and Media Gallery, “ Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians .” an apostle: See study note on Ro 1:1 . the holy ones: See study note on Ro 1:7 . in Ephesus: These words are found in authoritative ancient manuscripts and in ancient translations, though they do not appear in all ancient Greek manuscripts. Some who do not view the words as part of the original text have suggested that Paul sent this letter to Laodicea. ( Col 4:16 ) However, no manuscripts contain the words “to [or, “in”] Laodicea.” Also, early Greek manuscripts that omit “in Ephesus” in this verse all entitle this letter “To the Ephesians.” Moreover, early writers accepted it as the letter to the Ephesians. Also, Ephesus is the only city mentioned here in any of the manuscripts of this letter. Ephesus: In Bible times, this city was a wealthy and important religious and commercial center on the W coast of Asia Minor, opposite the island of Samos. Ephesus was the capital of the Roman province of Asia.​—See Glossary, App. B13 , and Media Gallery, “ The Theater and Surroundings in Ephesus .” in union with: Lit., “in.” This expression indicates close association, harmony, and unity. In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul several times mentions that the anointed Christians are “in union with” Christ Jesus, which highlights Christ’s important role in bringing about unity.​—See, for example, Eph 1:4, 11; 2:13, 21 . May you have undeserved kindness and peace: See study note on Ro 1:7 . in the heavenly places: Here Paul speaks of anointed Christians as having already received “every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,” though they were still on earth. The context shows that God “assigned [them] as heirs” with his Son in the heavenly inheritance and gave them a token of that inheritance. ( Eph 1:11, 13, 14 ) While yet on earth, they are raised up, or exalted, by having received such an assignment.​— Eph 1:18-20; 2:4-7 . in union with him: That is, with Christ.​— Eph 1:3 ; see study note on Eph 1:1 . the founding of the world: See study note on Lu 11:50 . For he foreordained us: In the Greek text, it is also possible to connect this expression with the preceding verse, making the sentence read: “For in love [vs. 5] he foreordained us.” he foreordained us: Jehovah foreordained, or determined in advance, that a group of Christ’s followers would be adopted as sons of God to rule with Jesus in heaven. He foreordained the group, not the individuals. Jehovah’s purpose was included in the prophecy at Ge 3:15 , which Jehovah declared shortly after Adam sinned.​— Ga 3:16, 29 ; see study note on Ro 8:28 . to be adopted as his own sons: See study notes on Ro 8:15; Ga 4:5 . the release by ransom: See study notes on Mt 20:28; Ro 3:24 and Glossary, “ Ransom .” through the blood of that one: That is, through the blood of Jesus Christ. While some translations use the word “death,” the literal rendering “blood” retains the Biblical concept of the atoning power of blood. (See Glossary, “ Atonement .”) On the Day of Atonement, designated animals were sacrificed. The high priest took some of their blood into the Most Holy of the tabernacle or temple and presented it there before God. ( Le 16:2-19 ) Jesus fulfilled what was foreshadowed by the Atonement Day, as Paul explains in his letter to the Hebrews. ( Heb 9:11-14, 24, 28; 10:11-14 ) Just as on Atonement Day the high priest took the sacrificial blood into the Most Holy, Jesus presented the value, or merit, of his lifeblood before God in heaven. according to the riches of his undeserved kindness: Ephesus was a materially prosperous city, but Paul’s letter stresses that true spiritual riches are connected with God’s undeserved kindness. ( Eph 1:18; 2:7; 3:8 ) Paul uses the Greek term rendered “undeserved kindness” 12 times in his letter to the Ephesians. When he met with the elders from Ephesus on an earlier occasion, he also mentioned this endearing quality.​— Ac 20:17, 24, 32 ; see study note on Ac 13:43 and Glossary, “ Undeserved kindness .” the sacred secret of his will: The term “sacred secret” is mentioned several times in Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. Generally speaking, Jehovah’s “sacred secret” centers on Jesus Christ. ( Col 2:2; 4:3 ) However, God’s sacred secret has many facets. These include: Jesus’ identity as the promised offspring, or Messiah, and his role in God’s purpose ( Ge 3:15 ); a heavenly government, God’s Messianic Kingdom ( Mt 13:11; Mr 4:11 ); the congregation of spirit-anointed Christians, of which Christ is head ( Eph 5:32; Col 1:18; Re 1:20 ); the role of those anointed ones who share the Kingdom with Jesus ( Lu 22:29, 30 ); and the selection of the anointed from among both Jews and Gentiles ( Ro 11:25; Eph 3:3-6; Col 1:26, 27 ).​—See study notes on Mt 13:11; 1Co 2:7 . for an administration: Or “to administer things.” The Greek word used here ( oi·ko·no·miʹa ) literally means “a house administration” or “a household management.” It refers to, not a specific government, but a way of administering or managing things. This understanding is consistent with the way the term is used at Eph 3:9 . (Compare Lu 16:2; Eph 3:2 ; and Col 1:25 , where the term is rendered “stewardship.”) This “administration” is not the same as God’s Messianic Kingdom. Rather, it is the way he chooses to manage the affairs of his universal family, or household. The administration will bring together the rulers of this heavenly Kingdom and accomplish his purpose of unifying all intelligent creatures, resulting in peace and unity with God through Jesus Christ. to gather all things together in the Christ: The administration that God has put in place will be carried out in two stages. The first stage is to gather together the things in the heavens, that is, those who are called to rule with Christ in heaven. ( Ro 8:16, 17; Eph 1:11; 1Pe 1:4 ) This stage began at Pentecost 33 C.E. ( Ac 2:1-4 ) The second stage is to gather together the things on the earth, that is, those who are to live in an earthly paradise as subjects of the heavenly government.​— Joh 10:16; Re 7:9, 10; 21:3, 4 . having been foreordained: See study note on Eph 1:5 . you were sealed: In Bible times, a seal was used as a signature to prove ownership, authenticity, or agreement. In the case of spirit-anointed Christians, God figuratively seals them with his holy spirit by means of Christ to indicate that they are his possession and that they are in line for heavenly life.​—See study note on 2Co 1:22 . which: Referring to God’s “holy spirit,” or active force, mentioned in the preceding verse. Although some manuscripts use a masculine Greek pronoun here, there is strong support for the reading that uses the neuter pronoun, translated “which.” The use of a neuter pronoun agrees with how God’s spirit is referred to in other Bible verses. Some scholars suggest that later scribes used a Greek pronoun indicating masculine gender to portray the holy spirit as a person.​—See study notes on Mt 28:19; Joh 14:17 . a token in advance: Or “a down payment; a guarantee (pledge) of what is to come.” Paul here uses a legal term ( ar·ra·bonʹ ) that often refers to an advance payment of money smaller than the full payment. All three occurrences of this Greek word in the Christian Greek Scriptures are used figuratively to refer to God’s anointing of Christians with “the promised holy spirit,” God’s active force. ( Eph 1:13, 14; 2Co 1:22; 5:5 ) This special operation of holy spirit becomes like a figurative down payment, a guarantee (or, a pledge) of what is to come. Because of this token of their heavenly inheritance, spirit-anointed Christians are convinced of their hope. They experience the complete fulfillment of their hope when they receive an incorruptible heavenly body.​— 2Co 5:1-5 . our inheritance: That is, the heavenly inheritance of Christians who have been anointed with God’s holy spirit. The spirit serves as “a token in advance of” their inheritance. ( 1Pe 1:4, 5 ) For anointed Christians, this inheritance involves more than life in heaven. They are “the things in the heavens” that are to be gathered together under Jesus to be “heirs . . . of God” and “joint heirs with Christ.” ( Eph 1:10; Ro 8:16, 17 ) The basic meaning of the Greek verb for “inherit” is for an heir to receive something as a right. This is often because of a family relationship, such as when a son receives an inheritance from his father. ( Ga 4:30 ) But here, as in most occurrences in the Christian Greek Scriptures , this term is used in the broader sense of something received as a gift from God.​— Mt 19:29; 1Co 6:9 . God’s own possession: Lit., “the possession.” This possession is the congregation of spirit-anointed Christians. ( Ac 20:28 ) At 1Pe 2:9 , these Christians are referred to as “a people for special possession.” revelation: See study note on Ro 16:25 . the eyes of your heart: This expression refers to a person’s figurative sight, or perception. ( Isa 44:18; Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2, 3; Mt 13:13-16 ) Paul tells spirit-anointed Christians that God has enlightened them “so that [they] may know to what hope he called [them].” Such spiritual insight convinces anointed Christians that a glorious reward awaits them​—made certain by the mighty power that God displayed by raising Jesus from the dead. this system of things: Or “this age.” In this context, the Greek word ai·onʹ refers to the present unrighteous system of things. ( Ga 1:4 ) Paul indicates that there is also a system of things, or an age, to come, in which there would be a government under the authority of Christ.​—See Glossary, “ System(s) of things .” Media Video Introduction to the Book of Ephesians Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians Shown here is a page from a papyrus codex known as P 46 , believed to date from about the year 200 C.E. This codex is a collection of nine of Paul’s letters. (See Media Gallery, “ Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians ” and “ Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians .”) This leaf shows the beginning of Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. In addition to being known as P 46 , the leaf is part of what is called Papyrus Michigan Inv. 6238 and is housed at the University of Michigan library, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A. Highlighted is the title, which reads “Toward [or, “To”] Ephesians.” Seal Devices The bronze seal shown in the photographs bears a name. In Roman times, people used seals to make impressions on wax or clay. Such seals had many different purposes. For example, as illustrated, potters stamped clay jars to identify the maker, the product, or the volume of the container. Sometimes plaster was used to fasten a cap on a jar. Before the plaster hardened, the seal of the merchant or the person shipping the product was pressed into it. Some people used a seal to make an impression that signified ownership of an item. Paul referred to a figurative seal of ownership when he stated that God had “put his seal on” Christians, or had anointed them with his holy spirit. This seal indicated that God was their Owner.​— 2Co 1:21, 22 . Previous Next Print Share Share
