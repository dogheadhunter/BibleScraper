Numbers 1:1-54 1 And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Siʹnai, + in the tent of meeting, + on the first day of the second month, in the second year of their coming out of the land of Egypt. + He said: 2 “Take a census + of the whole assembly of the Israelites * individually * according to their families, according to their paternal houses, according to the count of the names of all the males. 3 You and Aaron are to register by their companies * all those from 20 years old and up + who can serve in the army in Israel. 4 “Take with you one man from each tribe; each one is to be a head of his paternal house. + 5 These are the names of the men who will stand with you: of Reuʹben, E·liʹzur + the son of Shedʹe·ur; 6 of Simʹe·on, She·luʹmi·el + the son of Zu·ri·shadʹdai; 7 of Judah, Nahʹshon + the son of Am·minʹa·dab; 8 of Isʹsa·char, Ne·thanʹel + the son of Zuʹar; 9 of Zebʹu·lun, E·liʹab + the son of Heʹlon; 10 of the sons of Joseph: from Eʹphra·im, + E·lishʹa·ma the son of Am·miʹhud; from Ma·nasʹseh, Ga·maʹli·el the son of Pe·dahʹzur; 11 of Benjamin, Abʹi·dan + the son of Gid·e·oʹni; 12 of Dan, A·hi·eʹzer + the son of Am·mi·shadʹdai; 13 of Ashʹer, Paʹgi·el + the son of Ochʹran; 14 of Gad, E·liʹa·saph + the son of Deuʹel; 15 of Naphʹta·li, A·hiʹra + the son of Eʹnan. 16 These are the ones summoned from the assembly. They are the chieftains + of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the thousands of Israel.” + 17 So Moses and Aaron took these men who had been designated by name. 18 They gathered all the assembly on the first day of the second month, so that they might be registered individually by name, by family, and by their paternal houses, from 20 years old and up, + 19 just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. So he registered them in the wilderness of Siʹnai. + 20 The sons of Reuʹben, the descendants of Israel’s firstborn, + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted individually, 21 and the number registered of the tribe of Reuʹben was 46,500. 22 The descendants of Simʹe·on + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted individually, 23 and the number registered of the tribe of Simʹe·on was 59,300. 24 The descendants of Gad + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses.

All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 31 and the number registered of the tribe of Zebʹu·lun was 57,400. 32 The descendants of Joseph through Eʹphra·im + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 33 and the number registered of the tribe of Eʹphra·im was 40,500. 34 The descendants of Ma·nasʹseh + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses. All the males from 20 years old and up who could serve in the army were counted, 35 and the number registered of the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh was 32,200. 36 The descendants of Benjamin + were listed by name, by family, and by their paternal houses.

They did just so.
