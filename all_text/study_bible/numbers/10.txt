Numbers 10:1-36 10 Jehovah then said to Moses: 2 “Make two trumpets + for yourself; make them of hammered silver, and use them to summon the assembly and to break up the camps. 3 When both of them are blown, the whole assembly must be summoned to you at the entrance of the tent of meeting. + 4 If just one is blown, only the chieftains, the heads of the thousands of Israel, will be summoned to you. + 5 “When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast, the camps of those to the east + should depart. 6 When you sound a fluctuating trumpet blast a second time, the camps of those to the south + should depart. They should sound the trumpet blasts in this way each time one of them departs. 7 “Now when calling the congregation together, you should blow the trumpets, + but not with fluctuating blasts. 8 Aaron’s sons, the priests, should blow the trumpets, + and the use of them will serve as a lasting statute for you throughout your generations. 9 “If you should go to war in your land against an oppressor who is harassing you, you should sound a war call on the trumpets, + and you will be remembered by Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies. 10 “Also, on your joyous occasions + —your festivals + and at the beginning of your months—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings + and your communion sacrifices; + they will serve as a reminder for you before your God. I am Jehovah your God.” + 11 Now in the second year, in the second month, on the 20th day of the month, + the cloud lifted from over the tabernacle + of the Testimony. 12 So the Israelites began to pull away from the wilderness of Siʹnai in the order established for their departure, + and the cloud settled in the wilderness of Paʹran. + 13 This was the first time they departed following the order of Jehovah through Moses. + 14 So the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Judah departed first by their companies, * and Nahʹshon + the son of Am·minʹa·dab was over its company. 15 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Isʹsa·char was Ne·thanʹel + the son of Zuʹar. 16 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Zebʹu·lun was E·liʹab + the son of Heʹlon. 17 When the tabernacle was taken down, + the sons of Gerʹshon + and the sons of Me·rarʹi, + who carried the tabernacle, departed. 18 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of Reuʹben departed by their companies, * and E·liʹzur + the son of Shedʹe·ur was over its company. 19 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Simʹe·on was She·luʹmi·el + the son of Zu·ri·shadʹdai. 20 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Gad was E·liʹa·saph + the son of Deuʹel. 21 Then the Koʹhath·ites, who carried the sanctuary items, + departed. The tabernacle was to be set up by the time they arrived. 22 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Eʹphra·im departed by their companies, * and E·lishʹa·ma + the son of Am·miʹhud was over its company. 23 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh was Ga·maʹli·el + the son of Pe·dahʹzur. 24 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abʹi·dan + the son of Gid·e·oʹni. 25 Then the three-tribe division of the camp of the sons of Dan departed by their companies, * forming the rear guard for all the camps, and A·hi·eʹzer + the son of Am·mi·shadʹdai was over its company. 26 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Ashʹer was Paʹgi·el + the son of Ochʹran. 27 Over the company of the tribe of the sons of Naphʹta·li was A·hiʹra + the son of Eʹnan. 28 This was the order of departure that the Israelites and their companies * followed when they would depart. + 29 Then Moses said to Hoʹbab the son of Reuʹel * + the Midʹi·an·ite, the father-in-law of Moses: “We are setting out for the place about which Jehovah said, ‘I will give it to you.’ + Do come with us, + and we will treat you well, because Jehovah has promised good things for Israel.” + 30 But he said to him: “I will not go. I will return to my own country and to my relatives.” 31 At this he said: “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our guide. * 32 And if you do come with us, + whatever goodness Jehovah shows to us, we will surely show to you.” 33 So they began marching from the mountain of Jehovah + for a journey of three days, and the ark + of Jehovah’s covenant traveled before them for the three-day journey to search out a resting-place for them. + 34 And Jehovah’s cloud + was over them by day when they set out from the encampment. 35 Whenever the Ark was moved, Moses would say: “Rise up, O Jehovah, + and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee from before you.” 36 And when it would rest, he would say: “Do return, O Jehovah, to the countless * thousands of Israel.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “according to their armies.” ^ Lit., “according to their armies.” ^ Lit., “according to their armies.” ^ Lit., “according to their armies.” ^ Lit., “according to their armies.” ^ That is, Jethro. ^ Or “eyes.” ^ Or “myriads of.” Study Notes Media Previous Next Print Share Share
