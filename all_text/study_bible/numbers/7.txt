Numbers 7:1-89 7 On the day that Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, + he anointed it + and sanctified it, together with all its furnishings, the altar, and all its utensils. + When he had anointed and sanctified these things, + 2 the chieftains of Israel, + the heads of their paternal houses, made an offering. These chieftains of the tribes who presided over the registration 3 brought before Jehovah their offering of six covered wagons and 12 oxen, a wagon for two chieftains and a bull * for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4 Jehovah said to Moses: 5 “Accept these things from them, as they will be used for the service of the tent of meeting, and you should give them to the Levites, to each one as needed for his duties.” 6 So Moses accepted the wagons and the cattle and gave them to the Levites. 7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gerʹshon, according to what was needed for their duties; + 8 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Me·rarʹi, according to what was needed for their duties, under the direction of Ithʹa·mar the son of Aaron the priest. + 9 But he did not give any to the sons of Koʹhath because their duties involved the service of the holy place, + and they carried the holy things on their shoulders. + 10 Now the chieftains made their presentation at the inauguration * + of the altar on the day it was anointed. When the chieftains presented their offering before the altar, 11 Jehovah said to Moses: “One chieftain each day, on successive days, will present his offering for the inauguration of the altar.” 12 The one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahʹshon + the son of Am·minʹa·dab of the tribe of Judah. 13 His offering was one silver dish weighing 130 shekels * and one silver bowl weighing 70 shekels by the standard shekel of the holy place, * + both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering; + 14 one gold cup * weighing 10 shekels, full of incense; 15 one young bull, one ram, and one male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering; + 16 one young goat for a sin offering; + 17 and for a communion sacrifice, + two cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs each a year old.
