And YOU have said: “In what way have you loved us?” + “Was not Eʹsau the brother of Jacob?” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “But I loved Jacob, + 3 and Eʹsau + I have hated; and I finally made his mountains a desolated waste + and his inheritance for the jackals of [the] wilderness.” + 4 “Because Eʹdom * keeps saying, ‘We have been shattered, but we shall return and build [the] devastated places,’ this is what Jehovah of armies * has said, ‘They, for their part, will build; but I, for my part, shall tear down. + And people will certainly call them “the territory * of wickedness” and “the people whom Jehovah has denounced + to time indefinite.” 5 And YOUR own eyes will see [it], and YOU yourselves will say: “May Jehovah be magnified over the territory of Israel.”’” + 6 “‘A son, for his part, honors a father; + and a servant, his grand master. * + So if I am a father, + where is the honor to me? + And if I am a grand master, where is the fear + of me?’ Jehovah of armies has said to YOU , O priests who are despising my name. + “‘And YOU have said: “In what way have we despised your name?”’ 7 “‘[By] presenting upon my altar polluted bread.’ + “‘And YOU have said: “In what way have we polluted you?”’ “‘By YOUR saying: “The table + of Jehovah is something to be despised.” + 8 And when YOU present a blind [animal] for sacrificing: “It is nothing bad.” And when YOU present a lame [animal] or a sick one: “It is nothing bad.”’” + “Bring it near, please, to your governor. Will he find pleasure in you, or will he receive you kindly?” Jehovah of armies has said. 9 “And now, please, soften the face + of God, * that he may show us favor. + From YOUR hand this has occurred. Will he receive any of YOU men kindly?” Jehovah of armies has said. 10 “Who also is there among YOU that will shut the doors? + And YOU men will not light my altar—for nothing. + No delight do I have in YOU ,” Jehovah of armies has said, “and in the gift offering from YOUR hand I take no pleasure.” + 11 “For from the sun’s rising even to its setting my name will be great among the nations, + and in every place sacrificial smoke + will be made, a presentation will be made to my name, even a clean gift; + because my name will be great among the nations,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 12 “But YOU men are profaning + me * by YOUR saying, ‘The table of Jehovah * is something polluted, and its fruit is something to be despised, its food.’ + 13 And YOU have said, ‘Look! What a weariness!’ + and YOU have caused a sniffing at it,” * Jehovah of armies has said. “And YOU have brought something torn away, and the lame one, and the sick one; + yes, YOU have brought [it] as a gift. Can I take pleasure in it at YOUR hand?” + Jehovah has said. 14 “And cursed is the one acting cunningly when there exists in his drove a male animal, and he is making a vow and sacrificing a ruined one to Jehovah. * + For I am a great King,” + Jehovah of armies has said, “and my name will be fear-inspiring among the nations.” + Footnotes ^ “Malachi,” MTSyVg; LXX, “his messenger (angel).” ^ “Jehovah of armies.” Heb., Yehwahʹ tseva·ʼohthʹ .
