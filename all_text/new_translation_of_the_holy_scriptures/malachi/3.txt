I am sending my messenger, * + and he must clear up a way before me. + And suddenly there will come to His temple * + the [true] Lord, * + whom YOU people are seeking, and the messenger * + of the covenant + in whom YOU are delighting. + Look! He will certainly come,” Jehovah of armies has said. + 2 “But who will be putting up with the day of his coming, + and who will be the one standing when he appears? + For he will be like the fire of a refiner + and like the lye + of laundrymen. + 3 And he must sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver + and must cleanse the sons of Leʹvi; * + and he must clarify them like gold + and like silver, and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering + in righteousness. 4 And the gift offering of Judah and of Jerusalem will actually be gratifying to Jehovah, + as in the days of long ago and as in the years of antiquity. + 5 “And I will come near to YOU people for the judgment, + and I will become a speedy witness + against the sorcerers, + and against the adulterers, * + and against those swearing falsely, + and against those acting fraudulently with the wages of a wage worker, + with [the] widow + and with [the] fatherless boy, + and those turning away the alien resident, + while they have not feared me,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 6 “For I am Jehovah; I have not changed. + And YOU are sons of Jacob; YOU have not come to YOUR finish. + 7 From the days of YOUR forefathers YOU have turned aside from my regulations and have not kept [them]. + Return to me, and I will return to YOU ,” + Jehovah of armies has said. And YOU have said: “In what way shall we return?” 8 “Will earthling man * rob God? * But YOU are robbing me.” And YOU have said: “In what way have we robbed you?” “In the tenth parts * and in the contributions. 9 With the curse YOU are cursing + [me], * and me YOU are robbing—the nation in its entirety. 10 Bring all the tenth parts + into the storehouse, that there may come to be food in my house; + and test me out, please, in this respect,” + Jehovah of armies has said, “whether I shall not open to YOU people the floodgates of the heavens + and actually empty out upon YOU a blessing until there is no more want.” + 11 “And I will rebuke for YOU the devouring one, * + and it will not ruin for YOU the fruit of the ground, nor will the vine in the field prove fruitless for YOU ,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 12 “And all the nations will have to pronounce YOU happy, + for YOU yourselves will become a land of delight,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 13 “Strong have been YOUR words against me,” + Jehovah has said. And YOU have said: “What have we spoken with one another against you?” + 14 “Y OU have said, ‘It is of no value to serve God. + And what profit is there in that we have kept the obligation to him, and that we have walked dejectedly on account of Jehovah of armies? + 15 And at present we are pronouncing presumptuous people happy. + Also, the doers of wickedness have been built up. + Also, they have tested God * out and keep getting away.’” + 16 At that time those in fear of Jehovah + spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening. + And a book of remembrance * began to be written up before him + for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name. + 17 “And they will certainly become mine,” + Jehovah of armies has said, “at the day when I am producing a special property. + And I will show compassion upon them, just as a man * shows compassion upon his son who is serving him. + 18 And YOU people will again certainly see * [the distinction] between a righteous one and a wicked one, + between one serving God and one who has not served him.” + Footnotes ^ “And the messenger ( angel ).” Heb., u· mal·ʼakhʹ ; Gr., agʹge·los ; Lat., anʹge·lus . ^ “The [true] Lord.” Heb., ha·ʼA·dhohnʹ; Gr., Kyʹri·os; Lat., Do·mi·naʹtor .
