I am rebuking on YOUR account the [sown] seed, + and I will scatter dung * upon YOUR faces, the dung of YOUR festivals; and someone will actually carry YOU away to it. 4 And YOU will have to know that I have sent to YOU this commandment, + in order that my covenant + with Leʹvi * may continue,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 5 “As for my covenant, it proved to be with him, [one] of life and of peace, + and I kept giving them to him, with fear. And he continued fearing me; + yes, because of my name he himself was struck with terror. + 6 The very law of truth * proved to be in his mouth, + and there was no unrighteousness to be found on his lips. In peace and in uprightness he walked with me, + and many were those whom he turned back from error. + 7 For the lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and [the] law is what people should seek from his mouth; + for he is the messenger * of Jehovah of armies. + 8 “But YOU men— YOU have turned aside from the way. + Y OU have caused many to stumble in the law. + Y OU have ruined the covenant of Leʹvi,” + Jehovah of armies has said. 9 “And I also, for my part, shall certainly make YOU to be despised and low to all the people, + according as YOU were not keeping my ways, but were showing partiality in the law.” + 10 “Is it not one father that all of us have? + Is it not one God * that has created us? + Why is it that we deal treacherously with one another, + in profaning the covenant of our forefathers? + 11 Judah has dealt treacherously, and a detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; + for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, + which He has loved, and he has taken possession of the daughter of a foreign god * as a bride. + 12 Jehovah will cut off each one that does it, + one who is awake and one who is answering, from the tents of Jacob, and one who is presenting a gift offering + to Jehovah of armies.” 13 “And this is the second thing that YOU people do, [this resulting in] covering with tears the altar of Jehovah, with weeping and sighing, so that there is no more a turning toward the gift offering or a taking of pleasure [in anything] from YOUR hand. + 14 And YOU have said, ‘On what account?’ + On this account, that Jehovah himself has borne witness between you and the wife of your youth, + with whom you yourself have dealt treacherously, although she is your partner and the wife of your covenant. + 15 And there was one who did not do [it], as he had what was remaining * of [the] spirit. And what was that one seeking? The seed of God. * + And YOU people must guard yourselves respecting YOUR spirit, + and with the wife of your youth may no one deal treacherously. + 16 For he has hated a divorcing,” * + Jehovah the God of Israel has said; “and the one who with violence has covered over his garment,” + Jehovah of armies has said. “And YOU must guard yourselves respecting YOUR spirit, and YOU must not deal treacherously. + 17 “Y OU people have made Jehovah weary by YOUR words, + and YOU have said, ‘In what way have we made [him] weary?’ By YOUR saying, ‘Everyone that is doing bad is good in the eyes of Jehovah, and in such ones he himself has taken delight’; + or, ‘Where is the God * of justice?’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “it,” fem., referring to the blessing, fem. ^ Or, “fecal matter.” Possibly, “the contents of the stomach.” ^ “Levi,” MTSyVg; LXX, “the Levites.” ^ Or, “truthfulness; trueness.” Heb., ʼemethʹ; Lat., ve·ri·taʹtis . ^ “Messenger.” Heb., mal·ʼakhʹ; Gr., agʹge·los; Lat., anʹge·lus . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼel; Gr., the·ousʹ, “gods”; Lat., deʹi . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Gr., ho The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹi . ^ Lit., “as . . . the remnant ( remainder ).” Heb., u· sheʼarʹ . ^ Lit., “a sending away.” Lat., di·mitʹte .
