I am sending to YOU people E·liʹjah * the prophet + before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah. + 6 And he must turn the heart of fathers back toward sons, and the heart of sons back toward fathers; in order that I may not come and actually strike the earth * with a devoting [of it] to destruction.” * + Footnotes ^ TSyVg begin chap. 4 here; in MLXX this is 3:19, and chap. 3 continues to the end of the book. ^ LXX moves vs 4 to follow vs 6, thus making the prophecy end on a hopeful note. ^ “Elijah.” Heb., ʼE·li·yahʹ; LXXVg, “Elias.” ^ Or, “the land .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets ; Lat., terʹram . ^ Or, “with a ban.” Heb., cheʹrem . Because of this stern ending to this prophecy the Jews have a custom to repeat the reading of vs 5, which has a happy tone. Similar repetitions have been made at the end of other books such as Ecclesiastes, Isaiah and Lamentations. Previous Next Print Share Share
