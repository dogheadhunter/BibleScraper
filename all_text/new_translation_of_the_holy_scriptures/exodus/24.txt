Aaron and Hur + are with YOU . Whoever has a case at law, * let him approach them.” + 15 Thus Moses went up into the mountain while the cloud was covering the mountain. + 16 And Jehovah’s glory + continued to reside * upon Mount Siʹnai, + and the cloud continued to cover it for six days. At length on the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. + 17 And to the eyes of the sons of Israel the sight of Jehovah’s glory was like a devouring fire + on the mountaintop. 18 Then Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went on up the mountain. + And Moses continued in the mountain forty days and forty nights. + Footnotes ^ Or, “you must worship.” ^ “Book of the covenant.” This doubtless contained the legislation set out in 20:22–23:33 . ^ See 17:9 ftn. ^ “His minister ( attendant ; waiter ; servant ).” Heb., meshor·th ohʹ; Lat., mi·niʹster . ^ Lit., “Whoever is an owner of words,” that is, a litigant or controversialist. ^ Or, “to extend like a tent.” Previous Next Print Share Share
