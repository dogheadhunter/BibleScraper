The people of the sons of Israel are more numerous and mightier than we are. + 10 Come on! Let us deal shrewdly with them, * + for fear they may multiply, and it must turn out that, in case war should befall us, * then they certainly will also be added to those who hate us and will fight against us and go up out of the country.” 11 So they set over them chiefs of forced labor for the purpose of oppressing them in their burden-bearing; + and they went building cities as storage places for Pharʹaoh, namely, Piʹthom and Ra·amʹses. + 12 But the more they would oppress them, the more they would multiply and the more they kept spreading abroad, so that they felt a sickening dread as a result of the sons of Israel. + 13 Consequently the Egyptians made the sons of Israel slave under tyranny. + 14 And they kept making their life bitter with hard slavery at clay mortar + and bricks * and with every form of slavery in the field, + yes, every form of slavery of theirs in which they used them as slaves under tyranny. + 15 Later on the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, + the name of one of whom was Shiphʹrah and the name of the other Puʹah, 16 yes, he went so far as to say: “When YOU help the Hebrew women to give birth and YOU do see them on the stool for childbirth, if it is a son, YOU must also put it to death; but if it is a daughter, it must also live.” 17 However, the midwives feared the [true] God, + and they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them, + but they would preserve the male children alive. + 18 In time the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them: “Why is it YOU have done this thing, in that YOU preserved the male children alive?” + 19 In turn the midwives said to Pharʹaoh: “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women. Because they are lively, they have already given birth before the midwife can come in to them.” 20 So God dealt well with the midwives; + and the people kept growing more numerous and becoming very mighty. 21 And it came about that because the midwives had feared the [true] God he later presented them with families. * + 22 Finally Pharʹaoh commanded all his people, saying: “Every newborn son YOU are to throw into the river Nile, but every daughter YOU are to preserve alive.” + Footnotes ^ “Now these are the names.” Heb., Weʼelʹleh shemohthʹ .
