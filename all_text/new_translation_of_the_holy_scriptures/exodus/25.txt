They are not to be removed from it. + 16 And you must place in the Ark the testimony that I shall give you. + 17 “And you must make a cover * of pure gold, two and a half cubits its length and a cubit and a half its width. + 18 And you must make two cherubs of gold. Of hammered work you are to make them on both ends of the cover. + 19 And make one cherub on this end and one cherub on that end. + On the cover YOU are to make the cherubs at its two ends. 20 And the cherubs must be spreading out their two wings upward, screening over the cover with their wings, with their faces one toward the other. + Toward the cover the faces of the cherubs should be. 21 And you must place the cover + above upon the Ark, and in the Ark you will place the testimony that I shall give you. 22 And I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover, + from between the two cherubs that are upon the ark of the testimony, even all that I shall command you for the sons of Israel. + 23 “And you must make a table + of acacia wood, two cubits its length and a cubit its width and a cubit and a half its height. 24 And you must overlay it with pure gold, and you must make for it a border of gold round about. + 25 And you must make for it a rim of a handbreadth * round about, and you must make the border of gold for its rim round about. + 26 And you must make for it four rings of gold and place the rings on the four corners that are for the four feet. + 27 The rings should be close by the rim as supports for the poles to carry the table. + 28 And you must make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, and they must carry * the table with them. + 29 “And you must make its dishes and its cups and its pitchers and its bowls with which they will pour [libations]. * You are to make them out of pure gold. + 30 And you must put the showbread * upon the table before me constantly. + 31 “And you must make a lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work the lampstand is to be made. + Its base, * its branches, its cups, its knobs and its blossoms are to proceed out from it. 32 And six branches are running out from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from its one side and three branches of the lampstand from its other side. + 33 Three cups shaped like flowers of almond are on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like flowers of almond on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. + This is the way it is with the six branches running out from the lampstand. 34 And on the lampstand are four cups shaped like flowers of almond, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating. + 35 And the knob under two branches is out of it and the knob under the two other branches is out of it and the knob under two more branches is out of it, for the six branches running out from the lampstand. + 36 Their knobs and their branches are to proceed out from it. All of it is one piece of hammered work, of pure gold. + 37 And you must make seven lamps for it; and the lamps must be lit up, and they must shine upon the area in front of it. + 38 And its snuffers and its fire holders are of pure gold. + 39 Of a talent * of pure gold he should make it with all these utensils of it. 40 And see that you make them after their pattern that was shown to you in the mountain. + Footnotes ^ Or, “sacred portion; heave offering.” ^ Or, “tahash leather.” Heb., techa·shimʹ . ^ Apparently an apronlike garment consisting of front and back parts. ^ Or, “the residence place.” ^ “An Ark of.” Heb., ʼarohnʹ; different from te·vathʹ used in Ex 2:3 and Ge 6:14 ; Lat., arʹcam . ^ A cubit equaled 44.5 cm (17.5 in.). ^ Or, “mercy seat; propitiatory.” Heb., khap·poʹreth; Lat., pro·pi·ti·a·toʹri·um .
