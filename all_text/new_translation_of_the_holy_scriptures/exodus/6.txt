The sons of Israel have not listened to me; + and how will Pharʹaoh ever listen to me, + as I am uncircumcised in lips?” * + 13 But Jehovah continued to speak to Moses and Aaron and to issue the command by them to the sons of Israel and to Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, in order to bring the sons of Israel out from the land of Egypt. + 14 These are the heads of the house of their fathers: The sons of Reuʹben, Israel’s firstborn, + were Haʹnoch and Palʹlu, Hezʹron and Carʹmi. + These are the families of Reuʹben. + 15 And the sons of Simʹe·on were Jem·uʹel and Jaʹmin and Oʹhad and Jaʹchin and Zoʹhar and Shaʹul the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman. + These are the families of Simʹe·on. + 16 And these are the names of the sons of Leʹvi, + according to their family descents: + Gerʹshon and Koʹhath and Me·rarʹi. + And the years of Leʹvi’s life were a hundred and thirty-seven years. 17 The sons of Gerʹshon were Libʹni and Shimʹe·i, + according to their families. + 18 And the sons of Koʹhath were Amʹram and Izʹhar and Heʹbron and Uzʹzi·el. + And the years of Koʹhath’s life were a hundred and thirty-three years. 19 And the sons of Me·rarʹi were Mahʹli and Muʹshi. + These were the families of the Levites, according to their family descents. + 20 Now Amʹram took Jochʹe·bed his father’s sister as his wife. + Later she bore him Aaron and Moses. + And the years of Amʹram’s life were a hundred and thirty-seven years. 21 And the sons of Izʹhar were Koʹrah + and Neʹpheg and Zichʹri. 22 And the sons of Uzʹzi·el were Mishʹa·el and El·zaʹphan and Sithʹri. + 23 Now Aaron took E·liʹshe·ba, Am·minʹa·dab’s daughter, the sister of Nahʹshon, + as his wife. Later she bore him Naʹdab and A·biʹhu, El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar. + 24 And the sons of Koʹrah were Asʹsir and El·kaʹnah and A·biʹa·saph. + These were the families of the Koʹrah·ites. + 25 And El·e·aʹzar, Aaron’s son, + took for himself one of the daughters of Puʹti·el as his wife. Later she bore him Phinʹe·has. + These are the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their families. + 26 This is the Aaron and Moses to whom Jehovah said: + “B RING the sons of Israel out from the land of Egypt according to their armies.” + 27 They were the ones speaking to Pharʹaoh, Egypt’s king, to bring the sons of Israel out from Egypt. + This is the Moses and Aaron. 28 And it came about on the day that Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, + 29 that Jehovah went on to speak to Moses, saying: “I am Jehovah. + Speak to Pharʹaoh king of Egypt everything I am speaking to you.” 30 Then Moses said before Jehovah: “Look! I am uncircumcised in lips, so how will Pharʹaoh ever listen to me?” + Footnotes ^ “God,” MLXX; SamSyVg, “Jehovah.” ^ “As God Almighty .” Heb., be ʼElʹ Shad·daiʹ ; Gr., The·osʹ on au·tonʹ ; Lat., in Deʹo o·mni·po·tenʹte (omnipotent). ^ “But as respects my name Jehovah [יהוה, YHWH ].” Heb., u· shem iʹ Yehwahʹ; Lat., et noʹmen meʹum A·do·naʹi . ^ Or, “also as respects my name Jehovah did I not make myself known to them?” James Washington Watts (1977), “by my name Yahweh I had not made myself thoroughly understandable to them.” ^ Or, “take you as my people.” ^ Lit., “as God .” Heb., l Eʼ·lo·himʹ ; Gr., The·osʹ . ^ Or, “prove to be your God.” ^ Lit., “shortness of spirit [Heb., ruʹach ].” ^ “Uncircumcised in lips,” as though the lips had a foreskin over them, hence, too long and thick to utter speech with ease.
