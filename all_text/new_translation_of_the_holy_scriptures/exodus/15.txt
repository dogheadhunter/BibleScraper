I shall draw my sword! My hand will drive them away!’ * + 10 You blew with your breath, + the sea covered them; + They sank like lead in majestic waters. + 11 Who among the gods * is like you, O Jehovah? + Who is like you, proving yourself mighty in holiness? + The One to be feared + with songs of praise, + the One doing marvels. + 12 You stretched out your right hand, + the earth proceeded to swallow them up. + 13 You in your loving-kindness * have led the people whom you have recovered; * + You in your strength will certainly conduct them to your holy abiding place. + 14 Peoples must * hear, + they will be agitated; + Birth pangs + must take hold on the inhabitants of Phi·lisʹti·a. 15 At that time the sheiks of Eʹdom will indeed be disturbed; As for the despots of Moʹab, trembling will take hold on them. + All the inhabitants of Caʹnaan will indeed be disheartened. + 16 Fright and dread will fall upon them. + Because of the greatness of your arm they will be motionless like a stone, Until your people + pass by, O Jehovah, Until the people whom you have produced * + pass by. + 17 You will bring them and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, * + An established place * that you have made ready for you to inhabit, + O Jehovah, A sanctuary, + O Jehovah, * that your hands have established. 18 Jehovah will rule as king to time indefinite, even forever. + 19 When Pharʹaoh’s horses + with his war chariots and his cavalrymen went into the sea, + Then Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them, + While the sons of Israel walked on dry land through the midst of the sea.” + 20 And Mirʹi·am the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, + proceeded to take a tambourine in her hand; + and all the women began going out with her with tambourines and in dances. * + 21 And Mirʹi·am kept responding to the men: * + “Sing * to Jehovah, + for he has become highly exalted. + The horse and its rider he has pitched into the sea.” + 22 Later Moses caused Israel to depart from the Red Sea and they went out to the wilderness of Shur + and marched on for three days in the wilderness, but they did not find water. + 23 In time they came to Maʹrah, + but they were not able to drink the water from Maʹrah because it was bitter. That is why he called its name Maʹrah. * + 24 And the people began to murmur against Moses, + saying: “What are we to drink?” 25 Then he cried out to Jehovah. + So Jehovah directed him to a tree, and he threw it into the water and the water became sweet. + There He established for them * a regulation and a case for judgment and there he put them to the test. + 26 And he went on to say: “If you will strictly listen to the voice of Jehovah your God and will do what is right in his eyes and will indeed give ear to his commandments and keep all his regulations, + I shall put none of the maladies upon you that I put upon the Egyptians; + because I am Jehovah who is healing you.” + 27 After that they came to Eʹlim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. + So they went camping there by the water.
