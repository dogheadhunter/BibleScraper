Why do YOU keep putting Jehovah to the test?” + 3 And the people went on thirsting there for water, and the people kept murmuring against Moses and saying: “Why is it that you have brought us up out of Egypt to put us and our sons and our * livestock to death by thirst?” + 4 Finally Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying: “What shall I do with this people? A little longer and they will stone me!” + 5 Then Jehovah said to Moses: “Pass in front of the people + and take with you some of the older men of Israel and your rod with which you struck the Nile River. + Take it in your hand and you must walk on. 6 Look! I am standing before you there on the rock in Hoʹreb. * And you must strike on the rock, and water must come out of it, and the people must drink it.” + Subsequently Moses did so under the eyes of the older men of Israel. 7 So he called the name of the place Masʹsah * + and Merʹi·bah, * + because of the quarreling of the sons of Israel and because of their putting Jehovah to the test, + saying: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?” + 8 And the A·malʹek·ites * + proceeded to come and fight against Israel in Rephʹi·dim. + 9 At this Moses said to Joshua: * + “Choose men for us and go out, + fight against the A·malʹek·ites. Tomorrow I am stationing myself upon the top of the hill, with the rod of the [true] God in my hand.” + 10 Then Joshua did just as Moses had said to him, + in order to fight against the A·malʹek·ites; and Moses, Aaron and Hur + went up to the top of the hill. 11 And it occurred that as soon as Moses would lift his hand up, the Israelites proved superior; + but as soon as he would let down his hand, the A·malʹek·ites proved superior. 12 When the hands of Moses were heavy, then they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on this side and the other on that side, so that his hands held steady * until the sun set. 13 Hence Joshua vanquished Amʹa·lek and his people with the edge of the sword. + 14 Jehovah now said to Moses: “Write this as a memorial in the book + and propound it in Joshua’s ears, ‘I shall completely wipe out the remembrance of Amʹa·lek from under the heavens.’” + 15 And Moses proceeded to build an altar and to call its name Je·hoʹvah-nisʹsi, * 16 saying: “Because a hand is against the throne + of Jah, + Jehovah will have war * with Amʹa·lek from generation to generation.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ “Us . . . our . . . our.” Lit., “me . . . my . . . my,” referring to the “people.” ^ “Horeb.” Here, not the mountain on which the Ten Commandments were given, but the mountainous region around Mount Sinai, otherwise called the wilderness of Sinai. ^ Meaning “Testing; Trial.” ^ Meaning “Quarreling; Strife; Contention.” ^ Or, “Amalek,” in a collective sense. ^ Lit., “Jehoshua,” meaning “Jehovah Is Salvation”; Gr., Ἰησοῦ ( I·e·souʹ, “Jesus”). ^ Lit., “hands were steadiness.” ^ “Jehovah-nissi,” meaning “Jehovah Is My Signal [Pole],” by deriving nis·siʹ from nes, “signal pole”; LXX, “Jehovah Is My Refuge,” by deriving nis·siʹ from nus, “to flee for refuge”; Vg, “Jehovah Is My Exaltation,” by deriving nis·siʹ from na·sasʹ, “to hoist; to lift up.” ^ “Because with a secret hand Jehovah wages war,” LXX; Vg c , “Because the hand of Jehovah’s throne, and Jehovah’s war, will be.” Previous Next Print Share Share
