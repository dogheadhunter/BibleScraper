The altar + should be foursquare, and its height three cubits. 2 And you must make its horns + upon its four corners. Its horns will proceed out of it, and you must overlay it with copper. + 3 And you must make its cans for clearing away its fatty ashes, * and its shovels, and its bowls, and its forks, and its fire holders; and you will make all its utensils * of copper. + 4 And you must make a grating for it, a network + of copper; and you must make upon the net four rings of copper at its four extremities. 5 And you must put it under the altar’s rim down within, and the net must be toward the center of the altar. + 6 And you must make poles for the altar, its poles being of acacia wood, and you must overlay them with copper. + 7 And its poles must be put into the rings, and the poles must be upon the two sides of the altar when carrying it. + 8 A hollow chest of planks you will make it. Just as he showed you * in the mountain, so they will make it. + 9 “And you must make the courtyard + of the tabernacle. For the side toward the Negʹeb, to the south, the courtyard has hangings of fine twisted linen, + a hundred cubits being the length for the one side. 10 And its twenty pillars and their twenty socket pedestals are of copper. The pegs of the pillars and their joints * are of silver. + 11 So, too, it is for the north side in length, the hangings being for a hundred cubits of length, and its twenty pillars and their twenty socket pedestals being of copper, the pegs of the pillars and their joints being of silver. + 12 As for the width of the courtyard, on the west side the hangings are of fifty cubits, their pillars being ten and their socket pedestals ten. + 13 And the width of the courtyard on the east side toward the sunrising is fifty cubits. + 14 And there are fifteen cubits of hangings to one side, * their pillars being three and their socket pedestals three. + 15 And for the other side there are fifteen cubits of hangings, their pillars being three and their socket pedestals three. + 16 “And for the gate of the courtyard there is a screen twenty cubits long, of blue thread and wool dyed reddish purple and coccus scarlet material and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver, + their pillars being four and their socket pedestals four. + 17 All the pillars of the courtyard round about have fastenings of silver, and their pegs are of silver but their socket pedestals of copper. + 18 The length of the courtyard is a hundred cubits, + and the width fifty cubits, * and the height five cubits, of fine twisted linen, and their socket pedestals being of copper. 19 And all the utensils * of the tabernacle in all its service, and all its tent pins, and all the pins of the courtyard are of copper. + 20 “As for you, you are to command the sons of Israel that they get for you pure, beaten olive oil for the luminary, in order to light up the lamps constantly. + 21 In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain + that is by the Testimony, Aaron and his sons will set it in order from evening till morning before Jehovah. + It is a statute to time indefinite for their generations, + to be performed by the sons of Israel. + Footnotes ^ “Fatty ashes,” that is, the burned wood of the altar, soaked with animal fat. ^ “And all its utensils,” LXXSy; M, “as respects all its utensils.” ^ “Just as he showed you,” MSamSy; LXX, “According to what was shown you”; Vg, “Just as it has been shown to you.” ^ Or, “rings; hoops; bands; fillets,” for attachments. ^ Lit., “shoulder.” ^ “Fifty cubits,” Sam; MLXXSy, “fifty by fifty”; Vg, “fifty [cubits].” See App 8A . ^ Or, “furniture; furnishings.” Previous Next Print Share Share
