You must not desire your fellowman’s wife, + nor his slave man nor his slave girl nor his bull nor his ass nor anything that belongs to your fellowman.” * + 18 Now all the people were seeing * the thunders and the lightning flashes and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking. When the people got to see it, then they quivered and stood at a distance. + 19 And they began to say to Moses: “You speak with us, and let us listen; but let not God speak with us for fear we may die.” + 20 So Moses said to the people: “Do not be afraid, because for the sake of putting YOU to the test the [true] God has come, + and in order that the fear of him may continue before YOUR faces that YOU may not sin.” + 21 And the people kept standing at a distance, but Moses went near to the dark cloud mass where the [true] God was. + 22 And Jehovah went on to say to Moses: + “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Y OU yourselves have seen that it was from the heavens I spoke with YOU . + 23 Y OU must not make along with me gods * of silver, and YOU must not make gods of gold for yourselves. + 24 An altar of ground + you are to make for me, and you must sacrifice upon it your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices, * your flock and your herd. + In every place where I shall cause my name to be remembered I shall come to you and shall certainly bless you. + 25 And if you should make an altar of stones for me, you must not build them as hewn stones. In the event that you do wield your chisel upon it, then you will profane it. + 26 And you must not go up by steps to my altar, that your private parts * may not be exposed upon it.’ Footnotes ^ Or, “commands.” ^ Or, “I, Jehovah, am your God.” ^ “Not . . . any other gods .” Heb., loʼ . . . ʼelo·himʹ ʼache·rimʹ; Gr., the·oiʹ . ^ Or, “gods in defiance of me.” ^ “You must not . . . be induced to serve them.” Heb., weloʼʹ tho· ʽov·dh emʹ; Gr., me la·treuʹseis au·toisʹ, “ you will not render them sacred service .” Compare 3:12 ftn. ^ Or, “a God who is jealous (zealous); a God not tolerating rivalry.” Heb., ʼEl qan·naʼʹ; Gr., The·osʹ ze·lo·tesʹ . ^ Or, “children.” ^ Lit., “down to the third and fourth [generated] ones.” See Ge 50:23 ftn. ^ Or, “to the thousandth [generated] ones.” See De 7:9; Ps 105:8 . ^ See vs 17 ftn, “Fellowman.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” Heb., cheʹsedh . ^ Or, “not pronounce”; or, “not lift up (carry).” ^ Or, “to a falsehood”; or, “in vain.” ^ “Remembering.” Heb., za·khohrʹ .

It agrees with the first-century C.E. Jewish historian Josephus ( Jewish An­tiq­uities, Book III, chapter 5, ¶5) and with the first-century Jewish philosopher Philo, who divide off vs 3 as the first commandment, vss 4-6 as the second commandment and vs 17, which forbids all covetousness, as the tenth commandment. Others, including Augustine, consider vss 3-6 as one commandment but divide vs 17 into two commandments, the ninth against coveting a fellowman’s house and the tenth against coveting his living possessions. Augustine supported his division on the later parallel statement of the Ten Commandments in De 5:6-21 , which uses two different Heb. verbs in vs 21 in forbidding covetous desire for what belongs to a fellowman, whereas Ex 20:17 uses the same Heb. verb both times. Augustine’s division has been adopted by the Roman Catholic religious system. ^ “You must not desire .” Heb., loʼ tha ch·modhʹ . See De 5:21 ftn. ^ “Seeing.” The figure of speech here is called zeugma, meaning a yoke, that is, one verb is unequally yoked to two or more objects, while grammatically a second verb is required. Here the “seeing” applies to the lightning flashes and the mountain smoking, but hearing is required for the thunders and the sound of the horn. ^ “Gods of.” Heb., ʼeloʹheh; Gr., the·ousʹ . ^ Or, “peace offerings.” ^ Lit., “your nakedness.” Previous Next Print Share Share
