Ah!” And they will have to call a farmer to mourning, + and to wailing those experienced in lamentation.’ + 17 ‘And in all vineyards there will be wailing; + for I shall pass through the midst of you,’ + Jehovah has said. 18 “‘Woe to those who are craving the day of Jehovah! + What, then, will the day of Jehovah mean to YOU people? + It will be darkness, and no light, + 19 just as when a man * flees because of the lion, and the bear actually meets him; and [as when] he went into the house and supported his hand against the wall, and the serpent bit him. + 20 Will not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light; and will it not have gloom, and not brightness? + 21 I have hated, I have rejected YOUR festivals, + and I shall not enjoy the smell of YOUR solemn assemblies. + 22 But if YOU people offer up to me whole burnt offerings, + even in YOUR gift offerings I shall find no pleasure, + and on YOUR communion sacrifices of fatlings I shall not look. + 23 Remove from me the turmoil of your songs; and the melodious sound of your stringed instruments may I not hear. + 24 And let justice roll forth just like waters, + and righteousness like a constantly flowing torrent. + 25 Was it sacrifices and gift offerings that YOU people brought near to me in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel? + 26 And YOU will certainly carry * Sakʹkuth * YOUR king * + and Kaiʹwan, * YOUR images, the star of YOUR god, * whom YOU made for yourselves. + 27 And I will cause YOU to go into exile beyond Damascus,’ + he whose name is Jehovah the God of armies has said.” + Footnotes ^ “Bethel,” MTSyVg; LXX, “the house of Israel.” ^ See Job 9:9 ftn, “Kesil constellation.” ^ See Job 9:9 ftn, “Kimah constellation.” ^ Or, “a ransom.” Heb., khoʹpher . ^ “The God of armies.” Heb., ʼElo·heh- tseva·ʼohthʹ . ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ . See App 1B . ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “you have carried.” ^ “Sakkuth.” Heb., Sik·kuthʹ . The name was purposely vocalized in Heb. to correspond to shiq·qutsʹ, “disgusting thing.” It possibly refers to a star-god, for it is put in a parallelism with the “star of your god” in the same vs. LXXSy, “the tent”; Lat., ta·ber·naʹcu·lum . ^ “Your king .” Heb., mal·k ekhemʹ; Gr., Mo·lokhʹ ; Syr., de mal·k um; Lat., Moʹloch . ^ “Kaiwan.” Or, “Kewan.” Heb., Ki·yunʹ, vowel-pointed intentionally to correspond with shiq·qutsʹ, “disgusting thing.” Evidently the Akkadian star Kai·maʹnu, or Kai·waʹnu, is meant, because this occurs in Akkadian inscriptions as the name for Saturn (a star-god). Gr., Rhai·phanʹ; in Ac 7:43 in Stephen’s quotation, Rhom·phaʹ . ^ “Your god .” Heb., ʼelo·h eh·khemʹ, referring to a false god. Previous Next Print Share Share
