The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has spoken! Who will not prophesy?’ + 9 “‘P UBLISH it on [the] dwelling towers in Ashʹdod and on [the] dwelling towers in the land of Egypt, + and say: “Be gathered together against the mountains of Sa·marʹi·a, + and see the many disorders in the midst of her and cases of defrauding inside her. + 10 And they have not known how to do what is straightforward,” + is the utterance of Jehovah, “those who are storing up violence + and despoiling in their dwelling towers.”’ 11 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘There is an adversary even round about the land, + and he will certainly bring your * strength down from you, and your dwelling towers will actually be plundered.’ + 12 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Just as the shepherd snatches away from the mouth of the lion two shanks or a piece of an ear, + so the sons of Israel will be snatched away, those sitting in Sa·marʹi·a on a splendid couch + and on a Dam·a·sceneʹ divan.’ + 13 “‘H EAR and give witness * + in the house of Jacob,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, the God of the armies. * 14 ‘For, in the day of my holding an accounting + for the revolts of Israel against him, I will also hold an accounting against the altars of Bethʹel; + and the horns of the altar will certainly be cut off and must fall to the earth. + 15 And I will strike down the winter house + in addition to the summer house.’ + “‘And the houses of ivory will have to perish, + and many houses will have to come to their finish,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ “His confidential matter .” Heb., soh·dh ohʹ; Lat., se·creʹtum . ^ “Your,” fem. sing., referring to the city, fem. ^ Or, “warning.” ^ “The God of the armies .” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ hats· tseva·ʼohthʹ ; Lat., Deʹus e·xer·ciʹtu·um .
