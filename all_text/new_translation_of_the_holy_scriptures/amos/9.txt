And cut them off at the head, all of them. + And the last part of them I shall kill with the sword itself. No one fleeing of them will make good his flight, and no one escaping of them will make his getaway. + 2 If they dig down into Sheʹol, * from there my own hand will take them; + and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down. + 3 And if they hide themselves on the top of Carʹmel, from there I shall carefully search and be certain to take them. + And if they conceal themselves from in front of my eyes on the floor of the sea, + down there I shall command the serpent, and it must bite them. 4 And if they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I shall command the sword, and it must kill them; + and I will set my eyes upon them for bad, and not for good. + 5 And the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of the armies, * is the One touching the land, * so that it melts; + and all the inhabitants in it will have to mourn; + and it will certainly come up like the Nile, all of it, and sink down like the Nile of Egypt. + 6 “‘He who is building in the heavens his stairs, + and his structure over the earth that he founded; + he who is calling for the waters of the sea, + that he may pour them out upon the surface of the earth + —Jehovah is his name.’ + 7 “‘Are YOU not like the sons of the Cushʹites * to me, O sons of Israel?’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘Did I not bring Israel itself up out of the land of Egypt, + and the Phi·lisʹtines + out of Crete, * and Syria * out of Kir?’ * + 8 “‘Look! The eyes of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom, + and he will certainly annihilate it from upon the surface of the ground. + Nevertheless, I shall not completely annihilate the house of Jacob,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 9 ‘For, look! I am commanding, and I will jiggle the house of Israel among all the nations, + just as one jiggles the sieve, so that not a pebble falls to the earth. 10 By the sword they will die—all the sinners of my people, + those who are saying: “The calamity will not come near or reach as far as us.”’ + 11 “‘In that day I shall raise up + the booth * + of David that is fallen, + and I shall certainly repair their breaches. And its ruins I shall raise up, and I shall certainly build it up as in the days of long ago, + 12 to the end that they may take possession of what is left remaining of Eʹdom, + and all the nations * upon whom my name has been called,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, who is doing this. * 13 “‘Look! There are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and the plowman will actually overtake * the harvester, + and the treader of grapes, the carrier * of the seed; + and the mountains must drip with sweet wine, + and the very hills will all find themselves melting. + 14 And I will gather back the captive ones of my people Israel, + and they will actually build [the] desolated cities and inhabit [them], + and plant vineyards and drink the wine of them, and make gardens and eat the fruit of them.’ + 15 “‘And I shall certainly plant them upon their ground, and they will no more be uprooted from their ground that I have given them,’ + Jehovah your God * has said.” Footnotes ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
