There are days coming upon YOU , and he will certainly lift YOU up with butcher hooks and the last part of YOU with fishhooks. + 3 And [by] breaches YOU will go forth, + each one straight ahead; * and YOU will certainly be thrown out * to Harʹmon,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’ 4 “‘Come, YOU people, to Bethʹel and commit transgression. + At Gilʹgal be frequent in committing transgression, + and bring YOUR sacrifices in the morning; on the third day, YOUR tenth parts. * + 5 And from what is leavened make a thanksgiving sacrifice to smoke, + and proclaim voluntary offerings; + publish [it], for that is the way YOU have loved, O sons of Israel,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 6 “‘And I also, for my part, gave YOU people cleanness of teeth + in all YOUR cities and want of bread in all YOUR places; + but YOU did not come back to me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 7 “‘And as for me, I also withheld from YOU people the downpour when there were yet three months to the harvest; + and I made it rain on one city, but on another city I would not make it rain. There was one tract of land that would be rained on, but a tract of land on which I would not make it rain * would be dried up. + 8 And two or three cities staggered to one city in order to drink water, + and they would not get satisfied; but YOU did not come back to me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 9 “‘I struck YOU people with scorching and mildew. + There was a multiplying of YOUR gardens and of YOUR vineyards, but YOUR fig trees and YOUR olive trees the caterpillar would devour; + yet YOU did not come back to me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 10 “‘I sent among YOU people a pestilence in the nature of that of Egypt. + With the sword I killed YOUR young men, + along with the taking captive of YOUR horses. + And I kept making the stink of YOUR camps ascend even into YOUR nostrils; + but YOU did not come back to me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 11 “‘I caused an overthrow among YOU people, like God’s * overthrow of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah. + And YOU came to be like a log snatched out of [the] burning; + but YOU did not come back to me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 12 “Therefore that is what I shall do to you, O Israel. As a consequence of the fact that I shall do this very thing to you, get ready to meet your God, * + O Israel. 13 For, look! the Former of [the] mountains + and the Creator of [the] wind, + and the One telling to earthling man * what his mental concern * is, + the One making dawn into obscurity, + and the One treading on earth’s high places, + Jehovah the God of armies * is his name.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “each female [Heb., ʼish·shahʹ ] in front of her.” ^ “You will certainly be thrown out,” by a correction; M, “you [fem. pl.] will certainly throw out.” ^ Or, “your tithes.” ^ “I would not make it rain,” LXXVg; M, “it would not rain.” ^ “God’s.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ “To earthling man .” Heb., le ʼa·dhamʹ ; Gr., an·throʹpous ; Lat., hoʹmi·ni . ^ “His mental concern,” M; LXX, “his Christ (Anointed One).” ^ “God of armies,” M; LXX, “God, the Almighty.” Compare Re 11:17 .
