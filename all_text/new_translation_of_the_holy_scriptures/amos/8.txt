There are days coming,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘and I will send a famine into the land, a famine, not for bread, * and a thirst, not for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah. + 12 And they will certainly stagger from sea all the way to sea, and from north even to the sunrise. They will keep roving about while searching for the word of Jehovah, but they will not find [it]. + 13 In that day the pretty virgins will swoon away, also the young men, because of the thirst; + 14 those who are swearing by the guiltiness of Sa·marʹi·a, + and who actually say: “As your god is alive, * O Dan!” + and, “As the way of Beʹer-sheʹba + is alive!” And they will certainly fall, and they will rise up no more.’” + Footnotes ^ “The end.” Heb., haq·qetsʹ; a play on the Heb. word qaʹyits, “summer fruit,” in the first part of the vs. ^ “Summer fruit.” Heb., qaʹyits; points to the ending of the agricultural year. ^ “Meek ones,” M; M margin , “afflicted ones.” ^ Or, “Pride.” ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ Or, “for food .” Heb., lal· leʹchem . ^ Lit., “Alive [is] your god .” Heb., cheh ʼelo·h eyʹkha, the adjective “alive” being masc. sing.; Gr., the·osʹ ; Lat., deʹus .
