I, Paul, am telling YOU that if YOU become circumcised, + Christ will be of no benefit to YOU . 3 Moreover, I bear witness again to every man getting circumcised that he is under obligation to perform the whole Law. + 4 Y OU are parted from Christ, whoever YOU are that try to be declared righteous by means of law; + YOU have fallen away from his undeserved kindness. + 5 For our part we by spirit are eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness * as a result of faith. + 6 For as regards Christ Jesus * neither circumcision is of any value nor is uncircumcision, + but faith + operating through love + [is]. 7 Y OU were running well. + Who hindered YOU from keeping on obeying the truth? + 8 This sort of persuasion is not from the One calling YOU . + 9 A little leaven ferments the whole lump. + 10 I am confident + about YOU who are in union + with [the] Lord * that YOU will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing YOU trouble + will bear [his] judgment, + no matter who he may be. 11 As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then, indeed, the stumbling block * + of the torture stake * + has been abolished. + 12 I wish the men who are trying to overturn YOU + would even get themselves emasculated. * + 13 Y OU were, of course, called for freedom, + brothers; only do not use this freedom as an inducement for the flesh, + but through love slave for one another. + 14 For the entire Law stands fulfilled + in one saying, namely: “You must * love your neighbor as yourself.” + 15 If, though, YOU keep on biting and devouring one another, + look out that YOU do not get annihilated by one another. + 16 But I say, Keep walking by spirit + and YOU will carry out no fleshly desire at all. + 17 For the flesh is against the spirit + in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that YOU would like to do YOU do not do. + 18 Furthermore, if YOU are being led by spirit, + YOU are not under law. + 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, + and they are fornication, * + uncleanness, * loose conduct, * + 20 idolatry, practice of spiritism, * + enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects, * 21 envies, drunken + bouts, revelries, and things like these. As to these things I am forewarning YOU , the same way as I did forewarn YOU , that those who practice + such things will not inherit God’s kingdom. + 22 On the other hand, the fruitage + of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, + faith, 23 mildness, self-control. + Against such things there is no law. + 24 Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled * the flesh together with its passions and desires. + 25 If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit. + 26 Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition + with one another, * envying one another. + Footnotes ^ Or, “With her freedom.” Gr., Tei e·leu·the·riʹai . ^ Lit., “hope of righteousness.” ^ “Jesus.” B omits. ^ “I am confident in Jehovah concerning you,” J 7,​8 . ^ Or, “the offense.” Lit., “the fall-causer.” Gr., to skanʹda·lon; Lat., scanʹda·lum . ^ See App 5C . ^ “Would even get themselves emasculated,” P 46 א ABD; J 7,​8 , “would even be cut off from before the eyes of Jehovah.” ^ Or, “shall.” ^ Or, “filthiness; depravity; lewdness.” Gr., a·ka·thar·siʹa; J 17,​22 (Heb.), tum·ʼahʹ .
