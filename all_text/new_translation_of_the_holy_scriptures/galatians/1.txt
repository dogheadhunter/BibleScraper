Or am I seeking to please men? + If I were yet pleasing men, + I would not be Christ’s slave. + 11 For I put YOU on notice, brothers, that the good news which was declared by me as good news is not something human; + 12 for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught [it], except through revelation * by Jesus Christ. + 13 Y OU , of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Juʹda·ism, + that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting + the congregation of God and devastating it, + 14 and I was making greater progress in Juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my race, + as I was far more zealous + for the traditions + of my fathers. 15 But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb * and called + [me] through his undeserved kindness, + thought good 16 to reveal his Son in connection with me, + that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, + I did not go at once into conference with flesh and blood. + 17 Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles previous to me, + but I went off into Arabia, and I came back again to Damascus. + 18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem + to visit * Ceʹphas, + and I stayed with him for fifteen days. 19 But I saw no one else of the apostles, only James + the brother + of the Lord. 20 Now as to the things I am writing YOU , look! in the sight of God, I am not lying. + 21 After that I went + into the regions of Syria and of Ci·liʹcia. 22 But I was unknown by face to the congregations of Ju·deʹa that were in union with Christ; + 23 they only used to hear: “The man that formerly persecuted + us is now declaring the good news about the faith which he formerly devastated.” + 24 So they began glorifying + God because of me.
