After starting in spirit + are YOU now being completed in flesh? + 4 Did YOU undergo so many sufferings to no purpose? + If it really was to no purpose. 5 He, therefore, who supplies YOU the spirit + and performs powerful works * + among YOU , does he do it owing to works of law or owing to a hearing by faith? 6 Just as Abraham “put faith in Jehovah, * and it was counted to him as righteousness.” + 7 Surely YOU know that those who adhere to faith + are the ones who are sons of Abraham. + 8 Now the Scripture, seeing in advance that God would declare people of the nations righteous due to faith, declared the good news beforehand to Abraham, namely: “By means of you all the nations will be blessed.” + 9 Consequently those who adhere to faith are being blessed + together with faithful * Abraham. + 10 For all those who depend upon works of law are under a curse; for it is written: “Cursed is every one that does not continue in all the things written in the scroll of the Law in order to do them.” + 11 Moreover, that by law no one is declared righteous + with God is evident, because “the righteous one will live by reason of faith.” + 12 Now the Law does not adhere to faith, but “he that does them shall live by means of them.” + 13 Christ by purchase + released + us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse + instead of us, because it is written: “Accursed is every man hanged upon a stake.” * + 14 The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham might come to be by means of Jesus Christ for the nations, + that we might receive the promised spirit * + through our faith. + 15 Brothers, I speak with a human illustration: A validated covenant, though it is a man’s, no one sets aside or attaches additions to it. + 16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham + and to his seed. + It * says, not: “And to seeds,” as in the case of many such, but as in the case of one: + “And to your seed,” + who is Christ. + 17 Further, I say this: As to the covenant previously validated by God, + the Law that has come into being four hundred and thirty years + later does not invalidate it, so as to abolish the promise. + 18 For if the inheritance is due to law, it is no longer due to promise; + whereas God has kindly given it to Abraham through a promise. + 19 Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, * + until the seed should arrive + to whom the promise had been made; and it was transmitted through angels + by the hand of a mediator. + 20 Now there is no mediator where only one person is concerned, but God * is only one. + 21 Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? * + May that never happen! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, + righteousness would actually have been by means of law. + 22 But the Scripture + delivered up all things together to the custody of sin, + that the promise resulting from faith toward Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith. + 23 However, before the faith arrived, + we were being guarded under law, + being delivered up together into custody, looking to the faith that was destined to be revealed. + 24 Consequently the Law has become our tutor * leading to Christ, + that we might be declared righteous + due to faith. 25 But now that the faith has arrived, + we are no longer under a tutor. + 26 Y OU are all, in fact, sons + of God through YOUR faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For all of YOU who were baptized into Christ + have put on Christ. * + 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, + there is neither slave nor freeman, + there is neither male nor female; + for YOU are all one [person] in union with Christ Jesus. + 29 Moreover, if YOU belong to Christ, YOU are really Abraham’s seed, + heirs with reference to a promise. + Footnotes ^ Or, “due to a report of faith.” ^ Or, “performs miracles.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “believing.” ^ Or, “tree.” Gr., xyʹlou .
