God is love, + and he that remains in love + remains in union with God and God remains in union + with him. 17 This is how love has been made perfect with us, that we may have freeness of speech * + in the day of judgment, + because, just as that one is, so are we ourselves in this world. + 18 There is no fear in love, + but perfect love throws fear outside, + because fear exercises a restraint. * Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love. + 19 As for us, we love, because he first loved us. + 20 If anyone makes the statement: “I love God,” and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. + For he who does not love his brother, + whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen. + 21 And this commandment we have from him, + that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also. + Footnotes ^ Or, “test the spirits.” Lit., “be you proving the spirits.” ^ “Inspired expression.” Lit., “spirit.” Gr., pneuʹma·ti; Lat., spi·riʹtu·i; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ruʹach . ^ “Only-begotten.” Gr., mo·no·ge·neʹ; Lat., u·ni·geʹni·tum . ^ See 2:2 ftn. ^ “Christ,” B; א AVgSy h omit. ^ “Freeness of speech.” Or, “boldness.” Lit., “outspokenness.” ^ Or, “checking; correction; punishment.” Lit., “lopping off.” Gr., koʹla·sin .
