It is concerning that sin that I do not tell him to make request. + 17 All unrighteousness is sin; + and yet there is a sin that does not incur death. 18 We know that every [person] that has been born from God + does not practice sin, but the One + born from God * watches him, and the wicked one does not fasten his hold on him. + 19 We know we originate with God, + but the whole world is lying in the [power of the] wicked one. + 20 But we know that the Son of God has come, + and he has given us intellectual + capacity * that we may gain the knowledge of the true one. + And we are in union + with the true one, by means of his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true + God and life everlasting. + 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols. + Footnotes ^ “Is bearing witness.” Gr., mar·ty·rounʹ; Lat., te·sti·fi·caʹtur . ^ After “witness bearers” א ABVgSy h,p omit the words added in later Gr. mss and Vg c , namely: “in heaven, the Father, the Word and the holy spirit; and these three are one.
