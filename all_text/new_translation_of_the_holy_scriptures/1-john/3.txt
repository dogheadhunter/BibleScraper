That is why the world + does not have a knowledge of us, because it has not come to know him. + 2 Beloved ones, now we are children of God, + but as yet it has not been made manifest what we shall be. + We do know that whenever he * is made manifest + we shall be like him, + because we shall see him just as he is. + 3 And everyone who has this hope set upon him purifies + himself just as that one is pure. + 4 Everyone who practices * sin + is also practicing lawlessness, + and so sin + is lawlessness. 5 Y OU know too that that one was made manifest to take away [our] * sins, + and there is no sin + in him. 6 Everyone remaining in union + with him does not practice sin; + no one that practices sin has either seen him or come to know him. + 7 Little children, let no one mislead YOU ; he who carries on righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. + 8 He who carries on sin originates with the Devil, * because the Devil has been sinning from [the] beginning. * + For this purpose the Son of God was made manifest, + namely, to break up the works of the Devil. + 9 Everyone who has been born * from God does not carry on sin, + because His [reproductive] seed remains in such one, and he cannot practice sin, because he has been born from God. + 10 The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness + does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother. + 11 For this is the message which YOU have heard from [the] beginning, * + that we should have love for one another; + 12 not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered + his brother. And for the sake of what did he slaughter him? Because his own works were wicked, + but those of his brother [were] righteous. + 13 Do not marvel, brothers, that the world hates YOU . + 14 We know we have passed over from death to life, + because we love the brothers. + He who does not love remains in death. + 15 Everyone who hates + his brother is a manslayer, + and YOU know that no manslayer + has everlasting life remaining in him. + 16 By this we have come to know love, + because that one surrendered his soul * for us; + and we are under obligation to surrender [our] souls * for [our] * brothers. + 17 But whoever has this world’s means for supporting life + and beholds his brother having need + and yet shuts the door of his tender compassions upon him, + in what way does the love of God remain in him? + 18 Little children, let us love, + neither in word nor with the tongue, + but in deed + and truth. + 19 By this we shall know that we originate with the truth, + and we shall assure * our hearts before him 20 as regards whatever our hearts may condemn us in, + because God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. + 21 Beloved ones, if [our] hearts do not condemn [us], we have freeness of speech toward God; + 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, + because we are observing his commandments and are doing the things that are pleasing in his eyes. + 23 Indeed, this is his commandment, that we have faith in the name of his Son Jesus Christ + and be loving one another, + just as he gave us commandment. 24 Moreover, he who observes his commandments remains in union with him, and he in union with such one; + and by this we gain the knowledge that he is remaining in union with us, + owing to the spirit + which he gave us.
