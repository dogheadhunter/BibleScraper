+ This is the antichrist, + the one that denies the Father and the Son. + 23 Everyone that denies the Son does not have the Father either. + He that confesses + the Son has the Father also. + 24 As for YOU , let that which YOU have heard from [the] beginning remain in YOU . + If that which YOU have heard from [the] beginning remains in YOU , YOU will also abide in union + with the Son and in union with the Father. + 25 Furthermore, this is the promised thing that he himself promised us, the life everlasting. + 26 These things I write YOU about those who are trying to mislead YOU . + 27 And as for YOU , the anointing + that YOU received from him remains in YOU , and YOU do not need anyone to be teaching YOU ; + but, as the anointing from him is teaching YOU about all things, + and is true + and is no lie, and just as it has taught YOU , remain in union + with him. 28 So now, little children, + remain in union + with him, that when he is made manifest + we may have freeness of speech + and not be shamed away from him at his presence. * + 29 If YOU know that he is righteous, + YOU gain the knowledge that everyone who practices righteousness has been born from him. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “paraclete.” Gr., pa·raʹkle·ton . ^ “You may . . . commit a sin.” Gr., ha·marʹte·te, a verb in the aorist subjunctive.
