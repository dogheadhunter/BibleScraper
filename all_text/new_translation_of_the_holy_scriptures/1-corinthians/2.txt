So, too, no one has come to know the things of God, except the spirit + of God. 12 Now we received, not the spirit + of the world, but the spirit + which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. + 13 These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, + but with those taught by [the] spirit, + as we combine spiritual [matters] with spiritual [words]. * + 14 But a physical * man does not receive the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know [them], + because they are examined spiritually. 15 However, the spiritual + man * examines indeed all things, but he himself is not examined + by any man. 16 For “who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, * + that he may instruct him?” + But we do have the mind + of Christ. * Footnotes ^ Or, “superiority.” ^ Or, “full grown.” Lit., “perfect (ones).” ^ See 1:20 ftn. ^ Or, “orders of things.” Gr., ai·oʹnon; Lat., saeʹcu·la; J 22 (Heb.), ha· ʽoh·la·mimʹ , “the orders of things .” ^ Or, “as we match spiritual [matters] to spiritual [men].” ^ Or, “soulical.” Gr., psy·khi·kosʹ; Lat., a·ni·maʹlis . ^ Lit., “the spiritual ( one ).” Gr., ho . . . pneu·ma·ti·kosʹ ; Vg c (Lat.), spi·ri·tu·aʹlis . ^ See App 1D . ^ “Christ,” P 46 א ACVgSy p J 17,​18,​22 ; BD * It, “Lord.” Previous Next Print Share Share
