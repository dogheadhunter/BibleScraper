If it were all hearing, where would the smelling be? 18 But now God has set the members in the body, each one of them, just as he pleased. + 19 If they were all one member, + where would the body be? 20 But now they are many members, + yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand: “I have no need of you”; or, again, the head [cannot say] to the feet: “I have no need of YOU .” 22 But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker + are necessary, 23 and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we surround with more abundant honor, + and so our unseemly parts have the more abundant comeliness, 24 whereas our comely parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God compounded * the body, giving honor more abundant to the part which had a lack, 25 so that there should be no division * in the body, but that its members should have the same care for one another. + 26 And if one member suffers, all the other members suffer + with it; or if a member is glorified, + all the other members rejoice with it. + 27 Now YOU are Christ’s body, and members individually. + 28 And God has set the respective ones in the congregation, + first, apostles; + second, prophets; + third, teachers; + then powerful works; * + then gifts of healings; + helpful services, + abilities to direct, * + different tongues. + 29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they? * 30 Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, + do they? Not all are translators, + are they? 31 But keep zealously seeking the greater * gifts. + And yet I show YOU a surpassing way. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the spiritual things”; or, “the spiritual persons.” Lit., “the spiritual (things).” Gr., ton pneu·ma·ti·konʹ; Vg c (Lat.), spi·ri·tu·aʹli·bus . ^ Lit., “anathema.” Gr., A·naʹthe·ma . ^ Lit., “of gracious gifts.” Gr., kha·ri·smaʹton . ^ Lit., “of spirits.” Gr., pneu·maʹton . ^ Or, “of miracles.” ^ Lit., “mixed together.” Gr., sy·ne·keʹra·sen . ^ Or, “split.” Gr., skhiʹsma, “schism”; Lat., sciʹsma . ^ Lit., “steerings.” Gr., ky·ber·neʹseis; Lat., gu·ber·na·ti·oʹnes . ^ “Powerful works.” Or, “miracles.” ^ Lit., “Not all are powers, are they?” ^ Or, “the greatest.” Previous Next Print Share Share
