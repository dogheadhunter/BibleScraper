And his undeserved kindness that was toward me did not prove to be in vain, + but I labored in excess of them all, + yet not I but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me. + 11 However, whether it is I or they, so we are preaching and so YOU have believed. + 12 Now if Christ is being preached that he has been raised up from the dead, + how is it some among YOU say there is no resurrection * of the dead? + 13 If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised up. + 14 But if Christ has not been raised up, our preaching is certainly in vain, and our faith is in vain. + 15 Moreover, we are also found false witnesses of God, + because we have borne witness + against God that he raised up the Christ, + but whom he did not raise up if the dead are really not to be raised up. + 16 For if the dead are not to be raised up, neither has Christ been raised up. 17 Further, if Christ has not been raised up, YOUR faith is useless; YOU are yet in YOUR sins. + 18 In fact, also, those who fell asleep [in death] in union + with Christ perished. + 19 If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, + we are of all men most to be pitied. 20 However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, + the firstfruits + of those who have fallen asleep [in death]. + 21 For since death + is through a man, resurrection + of the dead is also through a man. 22 For just as in Adam all are dying, + so also in the Christ all will be made alive. + 23 But each one in his own rank: Christ the firstfruits, + afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence. * + 24 Next, the end, * when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power. + 25 For he must rule as king until [God] * has put all enemies under his feet. + 26 As the last enemy, death is to be brought to nothing. * + 27 For [God] “subjected all things under his feet.” + But when he says that ‘all things have been subjected,’ + it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him. + 28 But when all things will have been subjected to him, + then the Son himself will also subject himself * to the One + who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone. * + 29 Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of * [being] dead ones? + If the dead are not to be raised up at all, + why are they also being baptized + for the purpose of [being] such? 30 Why are we also in peril every hour? + 31 Daily I face death. + This I affirm by the exultation + over YOU , brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. 32 If, like men, * I have fought with wild beasts at Ephʹe·sus, + of what good is it to me? If the dead are not to be raised up, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.” + 33 Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil * useful habits. + 34 Wake up to soberness + in a righteous way and do not practice sin, for some are without knowledge of God. + I am speaking to move YOU to shame. + 35 Nevertheless, someone will say: “How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what sort of body are they coming?” + 36 You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies; + 37 and as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but a bare grain, + it may be, of wheat or any one of the rest; 38 but God gives it a body + just as it has pleased him, + and to each of the seeds its own body. 39 Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. + 40 And there are heavenly * + bodies, and earthly * bodies; + but the glory + of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort. 41 The glory of the sun + is one sort, and the glory of the moon + is another, and the glory of the stars + is another; in fact, star differs from star in glory. 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. + It is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption. + 43 It is sown in dishonor, + it is raised up in glory. + It is sown in weakness, + it is raised up in power. + 44 It is sown a physical * body, + it is raised up a spiritual body. + If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual one. 45 It is even so written: “The first man Adam became a living soul.” * + The last Adam became a life-giving + spirit. + 46 Nevertheless, the first is, not that which is spiritual, but that which is physical, afterward that which is spiritual. + 47 The first man is out of the earth and made of dust; + the second man is out of heaven. + 48 As the one made of dust + [is], so those made of dust [are] also; and as the heavenly one + [is], so those who are heavenly [are] also. + 49 And just as we have borne the image + of the one made of dust, we shall bear * also the image + of the heavenly one. 50 However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, + neither does corruption inherit incorruption. + 51 Look! I tell YOU a sacred secret: We shall not all fall asleep [in death], but we shall all be changed, + 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during * the last trumpet. For the trumpet + will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, + and this which is mortal + must put on immortality. * 54 But when [this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and] * this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: “Death + is swallowed up forever.” * + 55 “Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?” * + 56 The sting + producing death is sin, but the power for sin is the Law. * + 57 But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! + 58 Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, + unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, + knowing that YOUR labor is not in vain * + in connection with [the] Lord.
