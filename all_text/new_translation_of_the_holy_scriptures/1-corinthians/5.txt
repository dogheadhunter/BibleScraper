Do YOU not know that a little leaven ferments + the whole lump? + 7 Clear away the old leaven, that YOU may be a new lump, + according as YOU are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ + our passover + has been sacrificed. + 8 Consequently let us keep the festival, + not with old leaven, + neither with leaven + of badness and wickedness, + but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth. + 9 In my letter I wrote YOU to quit mixing in company with fornicators, 10 not [meaning] entirely with the fornicators + of this world + or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, YOU would actually have to get out of the world. + 11 But now I am writing YOU to quit mixing in company + with * anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy + person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard + or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. 12 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? + Do YOU not judge those inside, + 13 while God judges those outside? + “Remove the wicked [man] from among yourselves.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “that a certain [man] has [his] father’s wife.” ^ “Fornication.” Gr., por·neiʹa; Lat., for·ni·caʹti·o .
