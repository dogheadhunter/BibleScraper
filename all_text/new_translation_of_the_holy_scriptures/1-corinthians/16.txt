Therefore recognize men of that sort. + 19 The congregations of Asia send YOU their greetings. + Aqʹui·la and Prisʹca together with the congregation that is in their house + greet YOU heartily in [the] Lord. 20 All the brothers greet YOU . Greet one another with a holy kiss. + 21 [Here is] my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand. + 22 If anyone has no affection for the Lord, let him be accursed. + O our Lord, come! * + 23 May the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus be with YOU . 24 May my love be with all of YOU in union with Christ Jesus.
