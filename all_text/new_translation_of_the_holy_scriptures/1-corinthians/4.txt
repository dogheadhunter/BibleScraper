Yet by this I am not proved righteous, but he that examines me is Jehovah. * + 5 Hence do not judge + anything before the due time, until the Lord comes, + who will both bring the secret things of darkness to light + and make the counsels of the hearts manifest, + and then each one will have his praise come to him * from God. + 6 Now, brothers, these things I have transferred so as to apply to myself and A·polʹlos + for YOUR good, that in our case YOU may learn the [rule]: “Do not go beyond the things that are written,” + in order that YOU may not be puffed up + individually in favor of the one against the other. + 7 For who makes you to differ + from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive? + If, now, you did indeed receive [it], + why do you boast + as though you did not receive [it]? 8 Y OU men already have YOUR fill, do YOU ? Y OU are rich already, are YOU ? + Y OU have begun ruling as kings + without us, have YOU ? And I wish indeed that YOU had begun ruling as kings, that we also might rule with YOU as kings. + 9 For it seems to me that God has put us the apostles last on exhibition + as men appointed to death, + because we have become a theatrical spectacle * + to the world, and to angels, + and to men. * + 10 We are fools + because of Christ, but YOU are discreet + in Christ; we are weak, + but YOU are strong; + YOU are in good repute, + but we are in dishonor. * + 11 Down to this very hour we continue to hunger + and also to thirst + and to be scantily clothed * + and to be knocked + about and to be homeless + 12 and to toil, + working with our own hands. + When being reviled, we bless; + when being persecuted, we bear up; + 13 when being defamed, we entreat; + we have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now. + 14 I am writing these things, not to shame YOU , but to admonish YOU as my beloved children. + 15 For though YOU may have ten thousand tutors + in Christ, [ YOU ] certainly [do] not [have] many fathers; + for in Christ Jesus I have become YOUR father through the good news. + 16 I entreat YOU , therefore, become imitators of me. + 17 That is why I am sending Timothy to YOU , + as he is my beloved and faithful child + in [the] Lord; and he will put YOU in mind of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus, * + just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation. 18 Some are puffed up + as though I were in fact not coming to YOU . 19 But I will come to YOU shortly, if Jehovah * wills, + and I shall get to know, not the speech of those who are puffed up, but [their] power. 20 For the kingdom of God [lies] not in speech, but in power. + 21 What do YOU want? Shall I come to YOU with a rod, + or with love and mildness of spirit? + Footnotes ^ Or, “attendants; assistants.” Gr., hy·pe·reʹtas; Lat., mi·niʹstros . ^ “Stewards.” Gr., oi·ko·noʹmois, “house managers”; Lat., di·spen·sa·toʹres; J 17 (Heb.), has· so·khenimʹ , “the stewards .” ^ “Human tribunal.” Lit., “human day,” that is, a day appointed by a human judge. ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “his praise will come to each one.” ^ “Theatrical spectacle.” Lit., “a theater.” Gr., theʹa·tron; Lat., spec·taʹcu·lum . ^ Or, “both to angels and to men.” ^ “In dishonor.” Lit., “dishonorable (ones).” Gr., aʹti·moi . ^ Or, “naked.” ^ “Jesus,” P 46 א CVg c ; ABVgSy p omit. ^ See App 1D .
