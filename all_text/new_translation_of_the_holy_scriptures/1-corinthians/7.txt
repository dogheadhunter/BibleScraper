Has any man been called in uncircumcision? + Let him not get circumcised. + 19 Circumcision + does not mean a thing, and uncircumcision + means not a thing, but observance of God’s commandments [does]. + 20 In whatever state * each one was called, + let him remain in it. + 21 Were you called when a slave? Do not let it worry you; + but if you can also become free, rather seize the opportunity. 22 For anyone in [the] Lord that was called when a slave is the Lord’s freedman; + likewise he that was called when a freeman + is a slave + of Christ. 23 Y OU were bought with a price; + stop becoming slaves + of men. 24 In whatever condition + each one was called, brothers, let him remain in it associated with God. 25 Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion + as one who had mercy shown him by the Lord + to be faithful. + 26 Therefore I think this to be well in view of the necessity here with us, that it is well for a man to continue as he is. + 27 Are you bound to a wife? + Stop seeking a release. + Are you loosed from a wife? Stop seeking a wife. 28 But even if you did marry, you would commit no sin. + And if a virgin [person] married, such one would commit no sin. However, those who do will have tribulation in their flesh. + But I am sparing YOU . 29 Moreover, this I say, brothers, the time left is reduced. + Henceforth let those who have wives be as though they had none, + 30 and also those who weep be as those who do not weep, and those who rejoice as those who do not rejoice, and those who buy as those not possessing, 31 and those making use of the world + as those not using it to the full; for the scene of this world is changing. + 32 Indeed, I want YOU to be free from anxiety. + The unmarried man is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he may gain the Lord’s approval. 33 But the married man is anxious + for the things of the world, how he may gain the approval of his wife, + 34 and he is divided. Further, the unmarried woman, and the virgin, is anxious for the things of the Lord, + that she may be holy both in her body and in her spirit. However, the married woman is anxious for the things of the world, how she may gain the approval of her husband. + 35 But this I am saying for YOUR personal advantage, not that I may cast a noose upon YOU , but to move YOU to that which is becoming + and that which means constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction. + 36 But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virginity, * + if that * is past the bloom of youth, * and this is the way it should take place, let him do what he wants; he does not sin. Let them marry. + 37 But if anyone stands settled in his heart, having no necessity, but has authority over his own will and has made this decision in his own heart, to keep his own virginity, he will do well. + 38 Consequently he also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, + but he that does not give it * in marriage will do better. + 39 A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. + But if her husband should fall asleep [in death], she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in * [the] Lord. + 40 But she is happier if she remains as she is, + according to my opinion. I certainly think I also have God’s spirit. + Footnotes ^ “Prevalence of fornication.” Lit., “fornications.” ^ “Command.” Lit., “enjoinder.” ^ Lit., “opinion together.” ^ “God,” P 46 א ABCDVgSy p ; Sy h and TR, “the Lord”; J 7,​8,​10 , “Jehovah.” ^ “Jehovah,” in accord with Ro 12:3 and 2Co 10:13 ; P 46 א ABCD(Gr.), ho Kyʹri·os; Sy h and TR, “God.” See App 1D . ^ Or, “calling.” ^ Lit., “over bloom of life.” Gr., hy·perʹak·mos; Lat., su·per·a·dulʹta . ^ Or, “she.” ^ Or, “virgin.” Gr., par·theʹnon; Lat., virʹgi·ne . ^ Or, “her.” ^ Or, “if he is in union with.” Previous Next Print Share Share
