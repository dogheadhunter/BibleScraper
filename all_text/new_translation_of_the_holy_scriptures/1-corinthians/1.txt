Or were YOU baptized + in the name of Paul? 14 I am thankful I baptized none of YOU except Crisʹpus + and Gaʹius, + 15 so that no one may say that YOU were baptized in my name. 16 Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephʹa·nas. + As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anybody else. 17 For Christ dispatched me, + not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news, not with wisdom of speech, + that the torture stake * of the Christ should not be made useless. 18 For the speech about the torture stake is foolishness + to those who are perishing, + but to us who are being saved + it is God’s power. + 19 For it is written: “I will make the wisdom of the wise [men] perish, + and the intelligence of the intellectual + [men] I will shove aside.” + 20 Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? + Where the debater + of this system of things? * + Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish? + 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom + did not get to know God, + God saw good through the foolishness + of what is preached to save those believing. 22 For both the Jews ask for signs + and the Greeks look for wisdom; + 23 but we preach Christ impaled, + to the Jews a cause for stumbling + but to the nations foolishness; + 24 however, to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power + of God and the wisdom + of God. 25 Because a foolish thing * of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing * of God is stronger than men. + 26 For YOU behold his calling of YOU , brothers, that not many wise + in a fleshly way were called, + not many powerful, + not many of noble birth; 27 but God chose the foolish things of the world, + that he might put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame; + 28 and God chose the ignoble things of the world and the things looked down upon, the things that are not, + that he might bring to nothing + the things that are, 29 in order that no flesh might boast + in the sight of God. 30 But it is due to him that YOU are in union with Christ Jesus, who has become to us wisdom + from God, also righteousness + and sanctification + and release by ransom; + 31 that it may be just as it is written: “He that boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.” * + Footnotes ^ “Witness.” Gr., mar·tyʹri·on; Lat., te·sti·moʹni·um . ^ “Christ,” א ACDVgSy h,hi,p ; P 46 B omit. ^ “Day,” א AB; D, “presence”; Vg, “day of the advent.” ^ Or, “finish.” Gr., teʹlous . ^ Or, “splits.” Gr., skhiʹsma·ta, “schisms”; Lat., sciʹsma·ta . ^ Or, “fastened on a stake (pole).” See App 5C . ^ See App 5C . ^ Or, “order of things.” Gr., ai·oʹnos; Lat., saeʹcu·li; J 17,​22 (Heb.), ha· ʽoh·lamʹ haz·zehʹ, “this order of things .” ^ Or, “the foolishness.” ^ Or, “the weakness.” ^ See App 1D .
