Because her hair is given her instead of a headdress. * + 16 However, if any man seems to dispute + for some other custom, + we have no other, neither do the congregations of God. 17 But, while giving these instructions, I do not commend YOU because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that YOU meet together. + 18 For first of all, when YOU come together in a congregation, I hear * divisions * exist among YOU ; + and in some measure I believe it. 19 For there must also be sects * + among YOU , that the persons approved may also become manifest among YOU . + 20 Therefore, when YOU come together to one place, it is not possible to eat * the Lord’s evening meal. * + 21 For, when YOU eat [it], * each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated. 22 Certainly YOU do have houses for eating and drinking, do YOU not? + Or do YOU despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing + ashamed? What shall I say to YOU ? Shall I commend YOU ? In this I do not commend YOU . 23 For I received from the Lord * that which I also handed on to YOU , that the Lord Jesus in the night + in which he was going to be handed over took a loaf 24 and, after giving thanks, he broke it + and said: “This means * my body + which is in YOUR behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance + of me.” 25 He did likewise respecting the cup + also, after he had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant + by virtue of my blood. + Keep doing this, as often as YOU drink it, in remembrance + of me.” 26 For as often + as YOU eat this loaf and drink this cup, YOU keep proclaiming the death + of the Lord, until he arrives. + 27 Consequently whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty + respecting the body and the blood + of the Lord. 28 First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, + and thus let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup. 29 For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment + against himself if he does not discern the body. 30 That is why many among YOU are weak and sickly, and quite a few are sleeping + [in death]. 31 But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged. + 32 However, when we are judged, + we are disciplined by Jehovah, * + that we may not become condemned + with the world. + 33 Consequently, my brothers, when YOU come together to eat [it], + wait for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, + that YOU may not come together for judgment. + But the remaining matters I will set in order when I get there.
