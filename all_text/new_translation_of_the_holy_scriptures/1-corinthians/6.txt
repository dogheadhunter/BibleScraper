Why do YOU not rather let yourselves be wronged? + Why do YOU not rather let yourselves be defrauded? + 8 To the contrary, YOU wrong and defraud, and YOUR brothers at that. + 9 What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? + Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, + nor idolaters, + nor adulterers, * + nor men kept for unnatural purposes, + nor men who lie with men, * + 10 nor thieves, nor greedy + persons, nor drunkards, + nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. + 11 And yet that is what some of YOU were. + But YOU have been washed clean, + but YOU have been sanctified, * + but YOU have been declared righteous + in the name of our * Lord Jesus Christ + and with the spirit of our God. + 12 All things are lawful for me; but not all things are advantageous. + All things are lawful + for me; but I will not let myself be brought under authority by anything. + 13 Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods; + but God will bring both it and them to nothing. + Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; + and the Lord is for the body. + 14 But God both raised up the Lord + and will raise us up out of [death] + through his power. + 15 Do YOU not know that YOUR bodies are members + of Christ? + Shall I, then, take the members of the Christ away and make them members of a harlot? * + Never may that happen! 16 What! Do YOU not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? For, “The two,” says he, * “will be one flesh.” + 17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one + spirit. + 18 Flee from fornication. + Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his * body, but he that practices fornication is sinning against his own body. + 19 What! Do YOU not know that the body of YOU people is [the] temple * + of the holy spirit within YOU , + which YOU have from God? Also, YOU do not belong to yourselves, + 20 for YOU were bought with a price. + By all means, glorify God + in the body + of YOU people.
