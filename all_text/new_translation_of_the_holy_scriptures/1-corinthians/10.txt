The loaf which we break, + is it not a sharing in the body of the Christ? + 17 Because there is one loaf, we, although many, + are one body, * + for we are all partaking of that one loaf. + 18 L OOK at that which is Israel in a fleshly way: + Are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with * the altar? + 19 What, then, am I to say? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? + 20 No; but I say that the things which the nations * sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, + and not to God; and I do not want YOU to become sharers with the demons. + 21 Y OU cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah * + and the cup of demons; YOU cannot be partaking of “the table of Jehovah” * + and the table of demons. 22 Or “are we inciting Jehovah * to jealousy”? + We are not stronger + than he is, are we? 23 All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous. + All things are lawful; + but not all things build up. + 24 Let each one keep seeking, not his own [advantage], + but that of the other person. + 25 Everything that is sold in a meat market keep eating, + making no inquiry on account of YOUR conscience; + 26 for “to Jehovah * + belong the earth and that which fills it.” + 27 If anyone of the unbelievers invites YOU and YOU wish to go, proceed to eat everything that is set before YOU , + making no inquiry on account of YOUR conscience. + 28 But if anyone should say to YOU : “This is something offered in sacrifice,” do not eat on account of the one that disclosed it and on account of conscience. * + 29 “Conscience,” I say, not your own, but that of the other person. For why should it be that my freedom is judged by another person’s conscience? + 30 If I am partaking with thanks, why am I to be spoken of abusively over that for which I give thanks? + 31 Therefore, whether YOU are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. + 32 Keep from becoming causes for stumbling + to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God, 33 even as I am pleasing all people in all things, + not seeking my own advantage + but that of the many, in order that they might get saved. + Footnotes ^ “The same,” א c BVgSy p ; א * omits; P 46 A, “the.” ^ “Rock-mass.” Gr., peʹtra, fem.
