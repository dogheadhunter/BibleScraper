You have reserved the fine wine until now.” 11 Jesus performed this in Caʹna of Galʹi·lee as [the] beginning of his signs, and he made his glory + manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him. 12 After this he and his mother and brothers + and his disciples went down to Ca·perʹna·um, + but they did not stay there many days. 13 Now the passover + of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. + 14 And he found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves + and the money brokers in their seats. 15 So, after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. + 16 And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house + of my Father a house of merchandise!” + 17 His disciples called to mind that it is written: “The zeal for your house will eat me up.” + 18 Therefore, in answer, the Jews said to him: “What sign + have you to show us, since you are doing these things?” 19 In answer Jesus said to them: “Break down this temple, * + and in three days I will raise it up.” 20 Therefore the Jews said: “This temple was built in forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?” 21 But he was talking about the temple + of his body. 22 When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples called to mind + that he used to say this; and they believed the Scripture and the saying that Jesus said. 23 However, when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, at its festival, + many people put their faith in his name, + viewing his signs that he was performing. + 24 But Jesus himself was not entrusting + himself to them because of his knowing them all 25 and because he was in no need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “What to me and to you?” meaning “What is there in common between me and you?” An idiom; a repellent question indicating objection.
