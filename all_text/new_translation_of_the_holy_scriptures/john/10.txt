I have authority to surrender it, and I have authority to receive it again. + The commandment + on this I received from my Father.” 19 Again a division + resulted among the Jews because of these words. 20 Many of them were saying: “He has a demon + and is mad. Why do YOU listen to him?” 21 Others would say: “These are not the sayings of a demonized man. A demon cannot open blind people’s eyes, can it?” 22 At that time the festival of dedication * took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime, 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple in the colonnade of Solʹo·mon. + 24 Therefore the Jews encircled him and began to say to him: “How long are you to keep our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, + tell us outspokenly.” + 25 Jesus answered them: “I told YOU , and yet YOU do not believe. The works that I am doing in the name of my Father, these bear witness about me. + 26 But YOU do not believe, because YOU are none of my sheep. + 27 My sheep + listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. + 28 And I give them everlasting life, + and they will by no means ever be destroyed, + and no one will snatch them out of my hand. + 29 What my Father + has given me is something greater than all other things, * + and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father. + 30 I and the Father are one.” * + 31 Once more the Jews lifted up stones to stone him. + 32 Jesus replied to them: “I displayed to YOU many fine works from the Father. For which of those works are YOU stoning me?” 33 The Jews answered him: “We are stoning you, not for a fine work, but for blasphemy, + even because you, although being a man, make yourself a god.” + 34 Jesus answered them: “Is it not written in your Law, + ‘I said: “Y OU are gods”’? * + 35 If he called ‘gods’ + those against * whom the word of God came, and yet the Scripture cannot be nullified, + 36 do YOU say to me * whom the Father sanctified and dispatched into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, I am God’s Son? + 37 If I am not doing the works + of my Father, do not believe me. 38 But if I am doing them, even though YOU do not believe me, believe the works, + in order that YOU may come to know and may continue knowing that the Father is in union with me and I am in union with the Father.” + 39 Therefore they tried again to seize him; + but he got out of their reach. + 40 So he went off again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing + at first, and he stayed there. 41 And many people came to him, and they began saying: “John, indeed, did not perform a single sign, but as many things as John said about this man were all true.” + 42 And many put faith in him there. + Footnotes ^ Or, “right.” ^ Or, “my life .” Gr., psy·khenʹ mou; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), naph·sh iʹ .
