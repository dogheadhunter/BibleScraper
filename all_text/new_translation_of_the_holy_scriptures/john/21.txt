But although there were so many the net did not burst. 12 Jesus said to them: “Come, take YOUR breakfast.” + Not one of the disciples had the courage to inquire of him: “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, + and the fish likewise. 14 This was now the third time + that Jesus appeared to the disciples after his being raised up from the dead. 15 When, now, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter: “Simon son of John, * do you love * me more than these?” + He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” * + He said to him: “Feed my lambs.” + 16 Again he said to him, a second time: “Simon son of John, do you love * + me?” He said to him: “Yes, Lord, you know I have affection for you.” * He said to him: “Shepherd my little sheep.” + 17 He said to him the third time: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” * Peter became grieved that he said to him the third time: “Do you have affection for me?” So he said to him: “Lord, you know all things; + you are aware that I have affection for you.” * Jesus said to him: “Feed my little sheep. + 18 Most truly I say to you, When you were younger, you used to gird yourself and walk about where you wanted. But when you grow old you will stretch out your hands and another [man] will gird + you and bear you where you do not wish.” + 19 This he said to signify by what sort of death + he would glorify God. + So, when he had said this, he said to him: “Continue following me.” + 20 Upon turning about Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus used to love * + following, the one who at the evening meal had also leaned back upon his breast and said: “Lord, who is the one betraying you?” 21 Accordingly, when he caught sight of him, Peter said to Jesus: “Lord, what will this [man do]?” 22 Jesus said to him: “If it is my will for him to remain until I come, + of what concern is that to you? You continue following me.” 23 In consequence, this saying went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but: “If it is my will for him to remain + until I come, of what concern is that to you?” 24 This is the disciple + that bears witness about these things and that wrote these things, and we know that the witness he gives is true. + 25 There are, in fact, many other things also which Jesus did, which, if ever they were written in full detail, I suppose, the world itself could not contain the scrolls written. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “prefer.” ^ Or, “Master.” ^ Lit., “about two hundred cubits.” See App 8A . ^ Lit., “I am having affection for you.” Gr., phi·loʹ se . ^ Lit., “are you loving.” Gr., a·ga·paisʹ . ^ “John,” BVg; ASy p,s , “Jona.” See 1:42 ftn, “John.” ^ Lit., “are you loving.” Gr., a·ga·paisʹ . ^ Lit., “I am having affection for you.” Gr., phi·loʹ se . ^ Lit., “are you having affection for me?” Gr., phi·leisʹ me . ^ Lit., “I am having affection for you.” Gr., phi·loʹ se . ^ Or, “prefer.” ^ Vs 25 is contained in א c ABCVgSy p,s ; א * omits.
