He that has seen me has seen the Father + [also]. How is it you say, ‘Show us the Father’? + 10 Do you not believe that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me? + The things I say to YOU men I do not speak of my own originality; * but the Father who remains in union with me is doing his works. + 11 Believe me that I am in union with the Father and the Father is in union with me; otherwise, believe on account of the works themselves. + 12 Most truly I say to YOU , He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater + than these, because I am going my way to the Father. + 13 Also, whatever it is that YOU ask in my name, I will do this, in order that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son. + 14 If YOU ask * anything in my name, I will do it. 15 “If YOU love me, YOU will observe my commandments; + 16 and I will request the Father and he will give YOU another helper * to be with YOU forever, + 17 the spirit * of the truth, + which the world cannot receive, + because it neither beholds it nor knows it. Y OU know it, * because it remains with YOU and is in YOU . + 18 I shall not leave YOU bereaved. * + I am coming to YOU . 19 A little longer and the world will behold me no more, + but YOU will behold me, + because I live and YOU will live. + 20 In that day YOU will know that I am in union with my Father and YOU are in union with me and I am in union with YOU . + 21 He that has my commandments and observes them, that one is he who loves me. + In turn he that loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will plainly show myself to him.” 22 Judas, + not Is·carʹi·ot, said to him: “Lord, what has happened that you intend to show yourself plainly to us and not to the world?” + 23 In answer Jesus said to him: “If anyone loves me, he will observe + my word, and my Father will love him, and we shall come to him and make our abode with him. + 24 He that does not love me does not observe my words; and the word that YOU are hearing is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me. + 25 “While remaining with YOU I have spoken these things to YOU . 26 But the helper, * the holy spirit, which the Father will send in my name, that one * will teach YOU all things and bring back to YOUR minds all the things I told YOU . + 27 I leave YOU peace, I give YOU my peace. + I do not give it to YOU the way that the world gives it. Do not let YOUR hearts be troubled nor let them shrink for fear. 28 Y OU heard that I said to YOU , I am going away and I am coming [back] to YOU . If YOU loved me, YOU would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater + than I am. 29 So now I have told YOU before it occurs, + in order that, when it does occur, YOU may believe. 30 I shall not speak much * with YOU anymore, for the ruler + of the world is coming. And he has no hold on me, + 31 but, in order for the world to know that I love the Father, even as the Father has given me commandment + [to do], so I am doing. Get up, let us go from here.
