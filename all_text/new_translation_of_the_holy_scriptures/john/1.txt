What has come into existence 4 by means of him was life, + and the life was the light + of men. * 5 And the light is shining in the darkness, + but the darkness has not overpowered it. 6 There arose a man that was sent forth as a representative of God: + his name was John. * + 7 This [man] came for a witness, + in order to bear witness about the light, + that people of all sorts might believe through him. + 8 He was not that light, + but he was meant to bear witness + about that light. 9 The true light + that gives light + to every sort of man + was about to come into the world. * 10 He was in the world, + and the world came into existence through him, + but the world did not know him. 11 He came to his own home, but his own people did not take him in. + 12 However, as many as did receive him, + to them he gave authority to become God’s children, + because they were exercising faith in his name; + 13 and they were born, not from blood * or from a fleshly will or from man’s will, but from God. + 14 So the Word became flesh + and resided * among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son + from a father; and he was full of undeserved kindness and truth. + 15 (John bore witness about him, yes, he actually cried out—this was the one who said [it]—saying: “The one coming behind me has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me.”) + 16 For we all received from out of his fullness, + even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness. + 17 Because the Law was given through Moses, + the undeserved kindness + and the truth + came to be through Jesus Christ. 18 No man has seen God at any time; + the only-begotten god * + who is in the bosom [position] + with the Father is the one that has explained him. + 19 Now this is the witness * of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him to ask him: “Who are you?” + 20 And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed: “I am not the Christ.” + 21 And they asked him: “What, then? Are you E·liʹjah?” * + And he said: “I am not.” “Are you The Prophet?” + And he answered: “No!” 22 Therefore they said to him: “Who are you? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” + 23 He said: “I am a voice of someone crying out in the wilderness, ‘M AKE the way of Jehovah * straight,’ just as Isaiah the prophet said.” + 24 Now those sent forth were from the Pharisees. 25 So they questioned him and said to him: “Why, then, do you baptize + if you yourself are not the Christ or E·liʹjah or The Prophet?” 26 John answered them, saying: “I baptize * in water. In the midst + of YOU one is standing whom YOU do not know, + 27 the one coming behind me, but the lace of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” + 28 These things took place in Bethʹa·ny * across the Jordan, where John was baptizing. + 29 The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: “See, the Lamb + of God that takes away the sin + of the world! * + 30 This is the one about whom I said, Behind me there comes a man who has advanced in front of me, because he existed before me. + 31 Even I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing in water was that he might be made manifest to Israel.” + 32 John also bore witness, saying: “I viewed the spirit coming down as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him. + 33 Even I did not know him, but the very One who sent me + to baptize in water said to me, ‘Whoever it is upon whom you see the spirit coming down and remaining, this is the one that baptizes in holy spirit.’ + 34 And I have seen [it], and I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.” + 35 Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples, 36 and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: “See, the Lamb + of God!” 37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. 38 Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: “What are YOU looking for?” They said to him: “Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?” 39 He said to them: “Come, and YOU will see.” + Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour. * 40 Andrew + the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed [Jesus]. * 41 First * this one found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: “We have found the Mes·siʹah” * + (which means, when translated, Christ). + 42 He led him to Jesus. When Jesus looked + upon him he said: “You are Simon + the son of John; * + you will be called Ceʹphas” * (which is translated Peter). * + 43 The next day he desired to depart for Galʹi·lee. So Jesus found Philip + and said to him: “Be my follower.” + 44 Now Philip was from Beth·saʹi·da, + from the city of Andrew and Peter. 45 Philip found Na·thanʹa·el + and said to him: “We have found the one of whom Moses, in the Law, + and the Prophets + wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, + from Nazʹa·reth.” 46 But Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “Can anything good come out of Nazʹa·reth?” + Philip said to him: “Come and see.” 47 Jesus saw Na·thanʹa·el coming toward him and said about him: “See, an Israelite for a certainty, in whom there is no deceit.” + 48 Na·thanʹa·el said to him: “How does it come that you know me?” Jesus in answer said to him: “Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” 49 Na·thanʹa·el answered him: “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, + you are King + of Israel.” 50 Jesus in answer said to him: “Because I told you I saw you underneath the fig tree do you believe? You will see things greater than these.” 51 He further said to him: “Most truly * I say to YOU men, Y OU will see heaven opened up and the angels * + of God ascending and descending to * the Son of man.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the Logos.” Gr., ho loʹgos; Lat., Verʹbum; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), had·Da·varʹ . ^ Lit., “was toward the God.” Gr., en pros ton The·onʹ; J 17,​18 (Heb.), ha·yahʹ ʼeth ha·ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “A god.” Gr., the·osʹ, in contrast with ton The·onʹ, “the God,” in the same sentence; J 17,​18 (Heb.), w eʼ·lo·himʹ , “and god .” For a discussion of “a god,” see App 6A . ^ The punctuation of vss 3 and 4 is according to WH, Vg ww and The Greek New Testament by the United Bible Societies. ^ See Mt 3:1 ftn, “John.” ^ See 3:16 ftn. ^ Lit., “bloods.” ^ Lit., “tented.” See Re 21:3 ftns. ^ “The only-begotten god,” P 75 א c ; P 66 א * BC * , “only-begotten god”; AC c ItVgSy c,h , “the only-begotten Son.” ^ “Witness.” Gr., mar·ty·riʹa; Lat., te·sti·moʹni·um . ^ “Elijah” (meaning “My God Is Jehovah”), J 17,​18,​22 ; Gr., E·leiʹas . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “I immerse; I dip.” Gr., ba·ptiʹzo . ^ Not the Bethany near Jerusalem. ^ Compare 3:16 ftn. ^ That is, about 4 p.m., counting from sunrise. ^ Lit., “him.” ^ “Early next morning,” It mss Sy s . ^ Or, “the Anointed One.” Gr., ton Mes·siʹan; Lat., Mes·siʹam; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ham·Ma·shiʹach . ^ “John,” P 66,​75 א B * It; AB c Vg c Sy p,s , “Jona.” ^ “Cephas.” Gr., Ke·phasʹ .
