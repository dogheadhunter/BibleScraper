Holy Father, watch over them + on account of your own name which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are. + 12 When I was with them I used to watch over them + on account of your own name which you have given me; and I have kept them, and not one of them is destroyed + except the son of destruction, + in order that the scripture might be fulfilled. + 13 But now I am coming to you, and I am speaking these things in the world in order that they may have my joy in themselves to the full. + 14 I have given your word to them, but the world has hated + them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. + 15 “I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one. + 16 They are no part of the world, + just as I am no part of the world. + 17 Sanctify + them by means of the truth; your word + is truth. + 18 Just as you sent me forth into the world, I also sent them forth into the world. + 19 And I am sanctifying myself * in their behalf, that they also may be sanctified + by means of truth. 20 “I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word; + 21 in order that they may all be one, * + just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, + that they also may be in union with us, + in order that the world may believe that you sent me forth. + 22 Also, I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one. + 23 I in union with them and you in union with me, in order that they may be perfected into one, + that the world may have the knowledge that you sent me forth and that you loved them just as you loved me. 24 Father, as to what you have given me, I wish that, where I am, they also may be with me, + in order to behold my glory that you have given me, because you loved me before the founding * + of the world. + 25 Righteous + Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you; + but I have come to know you, and these have come to know that you sent me forth. + 26 And I have made your name known + to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “their knowing you.” Gr., hiʹna gi·noʹsko·si se . ^ Or, “And I am holding myself sacred ( treating myself as holy ).” Gr., kai . . . e·goʹ ha·gi·aʹzo e·mau·tonʹ; Lat., et . . . eʹgo sanc·tiʹfi·co me ipʹsum; J 17 (Heb.), wehith· qad·dash· tiʹ . ^ Or, “at unity.” Lit., “one (thing).” Gr., hen, neuter, to show oneness in cooperation.
