Into these very things angels are desiring to peer. * + 13 Hence brace up YOUR minds for activity, * + keep YOUR senses completely; + set YOUR hope * upon the undeserved kindness + that is to be brought to YOU at the revelation + of Jesus Christ. 14 As obedient children, * quit being fashioned + according to the desires YOU formerly had in YOUR ignorance, 15 but, in accord with the Holy One who called YOU , do YOU also become holy yourselves in all [ YOUR ] conduct, + 16 because it is written: “Y OU must be holy, because I am holy.” + 17 Furthermore, if YOU are calling upon the Father who judges impartially * + according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves with fear + during the time of YOUR alien residence. + 18 For YOU know that it was not with corruptible things, + with silver or gold, that YOU were delivered * + from YOUR fruitless form of conduct received by tradition from YOUR forefathers. 19 But it was with precious blood, + like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, + even Christ’s. + 20 True, he was foreknown before the founding * + of the world, but he was made manifest at the end of the times for the sake of YOU + 21 who through him are believers in God, + the one who raised him up from the dead + and gave him glory; + so that YOUR faith and hope might be in God. + 22 Now that YOU have purified + YOUR souls * by [ YOUR ] obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly affection + as the result, love one another intensely * from the heart. + 23 For YOU have been given a new birth, + not by corruptible, + but by incorruptible + [reproductive] seed, * + through the word + of [the] living and enduring + God. 24 For “all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like a blossom of grass; + the grass becomes withered, and the flower falls off, + 25 but the saying of Jehovah * endures forever.” + Well, this is the “saying,” + this which has been declared + to YOU as good news.
