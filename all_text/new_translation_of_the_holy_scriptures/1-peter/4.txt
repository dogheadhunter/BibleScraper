The glory + and the might are his forever and ever. Amen. 12 Beloved ones, do not be puzzled at the burning among YOU , which is happening to YOU for a trial, + as though a strange thing were befalling YOU . 13 On the contrary, go on rejoicing + forasmuch as YOU are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, + that YOU may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation * + of his glory. 14 If YOU are being reproached for the name of Christ, + YOU are happy, + because the [spirit] of glory, even the spirit of God, is resting upon YOU . + 15 However, let none of YOU suffer + as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a busybody + in other people’s matters. 16 But if [he suffers] + as a Christian, * let him not feel shame, + but let him keep on glorifying God in this name. 17 For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. + Now if it starts first with us, + what will the end be of those who are not obedient to the good news of God? + 18 “And if the righteous [man] is being saved with difficulty, + where will the ungodly [man] and the sinner make a showing?” + 19 So, then, also let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on commending their souls to a faithful Creator while they are doing good. * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “mental inclination.” ^ “Deeds of loose conduct.” Gr., a·sel·geiʹais; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), zim·mahʹ .
