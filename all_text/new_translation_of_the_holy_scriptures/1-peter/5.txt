But all of YOU gird yourselves with lowliness of mind toward one another, + because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones. + 6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt YOU in due time; + 7 while YOU throw all YOUR anxiety + upon him, because he cares for YOU . + 8 Keep YOUR senses, be watchful. + Y OUR adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour * [someone]. + 9 But take YOUR stand against him, + solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of YOUR brothers * in the world. + 10 But, after YOU have suffered a little while, + the God of all undeserved kindness, who called YOU to his everlasting glory + in union + with Christ, will himself finish YOUR training, he will make YOU firm, + he will make YOU strong. + 11 To him be the might + forever. Amen. 12 Through Sil·vaʹnus, * + a faithful brother, as I account him, I have written YOU in few [words], + to give encouragement and an earnest witness that this is the true undeserved kindness of God; in which stand firm. + 13 She who is in Babylon, * + a chosen one like [ YOU ], sends YOU her greetings, and so does Mark + my son. 14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. + May all of YOU who are in union with Christ have peace. + Footnotes ^ “Older man with [them].” Lit., “fellow elder.” Gr., syn·pre·sbyʹte·ros . ^ Or, “elders.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹrous . ^ Lit., “not necessarily.” ^ Lit., “yieldingly.” ^ Or, “lording it over those allotted to you.” ^ Lit., “the.” J 13,​14,​17,​18 , “Jehovah’s.” ^ Or, “carry away as a prize.” ^ Lit., “to drink down.” ^ “Entire association of . . . brothers.” Lit., “brotherhood.” Gr., a·del·phoʹte·ti . ^ Or, “Silas.” ^ “Babylon.” Gr., Ba·by·loʹni; J 17,​22 (Heb.), ­ beVa·velʹ, “in Babylon.” Previous Next Print Share Share
