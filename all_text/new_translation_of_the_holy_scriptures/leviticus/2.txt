Along with every offering of yours you will present salt. 14 “‘And if you would present the grain offering of the first ripe fruits to Jehovah, you should present green ears roasted with fire, the grits * of new grain, as the grain offering of your first ripe fruits. + 15 And you must put oil upon it and place frankincense upon it. It is a grain offering. + 16 And the priest must make the remembrancer + of it smoke, that is, some of its grits and oil, along with all its frankincense, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah. Footnotes ^ Or, “and.” ^ “Breaking.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ A cooking pot for deep-fat frying, like a present-day soup or stew kettle. ^ “Honey.” Evidently not that of the bee but the moisture or syrup of figs, or juice or syrup of fruits. ^ Or, “As for.” ^ That is, coarsely crushed kernels.
