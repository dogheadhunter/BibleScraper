It is a statute to time indefinite for YOUR generations, 10 both in order to make a distinction between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean, + 11 and in order to teach the sons of Israel + all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them by means of Moses.” 12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, his sons that were left: “Take the grain offering + that was left over from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire and eat it unfermented near the altar, because it is something most holy. + 13 And YOU must eat it in a holy place, + because it is your allowance and the allowance of your sons from Jehovah’s offerings made by fire; for so I have been commanded. 14 And YOU will eat the breast of the wave offering + and the leg of the sacred portion + in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, + because they have been given as your allowance and the allowance of your sons from the communion sacrifices of the sons of Israel. 15 They will bring the leg of the sacred portion and the breast of the wave offering + along with the offerings made by fire, of the fatty pieces, in order to wave the wave offering to and fro before Jehovah; and it must serve as an allowance + to time indefinite for you and your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.” 16 And Moses searched thoroughly for the goat of the sin offering, + and, look! it had been burned up. So he grew indignant at El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar, Aaron’s sons that were left, saying: 17 “Why did YOU not eat the sin offering in the place that is holy, + since it is something most holy and he has given it to YOU that YOU may answer for the error of the assembly so as to make atonement for them before Jehovah? + 18 Look! Its blood has not been brought into the holy place within. + Y OU should have eaten it without fail in the holy place, just as I had been commanded.” * + 19 At this Aaron spoke to Moses: “Look! Today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, + while such things as these began to befall me; and had I eaten the sin offering today, would it prove satisfactory in Jehovah’s eyes?” + 20 When Moses got to hear that, then it proved satisfactory in his eyes.
