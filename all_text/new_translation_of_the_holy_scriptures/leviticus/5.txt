He must not put oil + upon it and he must not place frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering. + 12 And he must bring it to the priest, and the priest must grasp from it his handful as a remembrancer + of it and must make it smoke on the altar upon Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. + It is a sin offering. + 13 And the priest must make an atonement + for him for his sin that he has committed, any one of these sins, * and so it must be forgiven him; and it must become the priest’s + the same as a grain offering.’” 14 And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 15 “In case a soul behaves unfaithfully in that he actually sins by mistake against the holy things of Jehovah, + then he must bring as his guilt offering + to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock, according to the * estimated value in silver shekels, + by the shekel of the holy place, * as a guilt offering. 16 And he will make compensation for the sin he has committed against the holy place and he will add to it a fifth + of it, and he must give it to the priest, that the priest may make an atonement + for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and so it must be forgiven + him. 17 “And if a soul sins in that he does do one of all the things that Jehovah commands should not be done, although he did not know it, + yet he has become guilty and must answer for his error. + 18 And he must bring a sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value, for a guilt offering, + to the priest; and the priest must make an atonement + for him for his mistake that he committed unintentionally, although he himself did not know it, and so it must be forgiven him. + 19 It is a guilt offering. He has positively become guilty + against Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “heard the voice (sound) of cursing.” See Ge 24:41 ftn. ^ “Unclean,” ceremonially. ^ “Uncleanness,” that is, ceremonial. ^ Lit., “If, though, his hand cannot reach.” ^ Lit., “sons of a pigeon.” ^ An ephah equaled 22 L (20 dry qt). ^ Or, “things; cases.” ^ Or, “by the holy shekel.” A standard weight kept at the tabernacle, or possibly to emphasize that the weight should be precise.
