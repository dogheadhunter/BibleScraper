He should prove to be holy to you, + because I Jehovah, who am sanctifying YOU , am holy. + 9 “‘Now in case the daughter of a priest should make herself profane by committing prostitution, it is her father that she is profaning. She should be burned in the fire. + 10 “‘And as for the high priest of his brothers upon whose head the anointing oil would be poured + and whose hand was filled with power * to wear the garments, + he should not let his head go ungroomed, + and he should not tear his garments. + 11 And he should not come to any dead soul. * + For his father and his mother he may not defile himself. 12 He should also not go out from the sanctuary and not profane the sanctuary of his God, + because the sign of dedication, the anointing oil of his God, + is upon him. I am Jehovah. 13 “‘And for his part, he should take a woman in her virginity. + 14 As for a widow or a divorced woman and one violated, a prostitute, none of these may he take, but he should take a virgin from his people as a wife. 15 And he should not profane his seed * among his people, + because I am Jehovah who is sanctifying him.’” + 16 And Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 17 “Speak to Aaron, saying, ‘No man of your seed throughout their generations in whom there proves to be a defect + may come near to present the bread of his God. + 18 In case there is any man in whom there is a defect, he may not come near: a man blind or lame or with his nose slit or with one member too long, * + 19 or a man in whom there proves to be a fracture of the foot or a fracture of the hand, 20 or hunchback or thin * or diseased in his eyes or scabby or having ringworms or having his testicles broken. + 21 Any man of the seed of Aaron the priest in whom there is a defect may not approach to present Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. + There is a defect in him. He may not approach to present the bread of his God. + 22 He may eat the bread of his God from the most holy things + and from the holy things. + 23 However, he may not come in near the curtain, + and he may not approach the altar, + because there is a defect in him; + and he should not profane my sanctuary, + for I am Jehovah who is sanctifying them.’” + 24 Accordingly Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and all the sons of Israel.
