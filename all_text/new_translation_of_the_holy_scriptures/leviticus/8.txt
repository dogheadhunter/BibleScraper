but Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood round about upon the altar. + 25 Then he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was upon the intestines, + and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right leg. + 26 And out of the basket of unfermented cakes that was before Jehovah he took one unfermented ring-shaped cake + and one ring-shaped cake of oiled bread + and one wafer. + He then placed them upon the fatty pieces and the right leg. 27 After that he put all of them upon the palms of Aaron and the palms of his sons and began to wave them to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah. + 28 Then Moses took them off their palms and made them smoke upon the altar on top of the burnt offering. + They were an installation + sacrifice for a restful odor. + It was an offering made by fire to Jehovah. + 29 And Moses proceeded to take the breast + and to wave it to and fro as a wave offering before Jehovah. + From the installation ram it became the portion + for Moses, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses. 30 After that Moses took some of the anointing oil + and some of the blood that was upon the altar and spattered it upon Aaron and his garments and upon his sons and the garments of his sons with him. Thus he sanctified + Aaron and his garments and his sons and the garments of his sons + with him. 31 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons: “Boil + the flesh at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there is where YOU will eat it + and the bread that is in the installation basket, just as I was given the command, * saying, ‘Aaron and his sons will eat it.’ 32 And what is left over of the flesh and the bread YOU will burn with fire. + 33 And YOU must not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting for seven days, + until the day of fulfilling the days of YOUR installation, because it will take seven days to fill YOUR hand with power. * + 34 Just as it has been done this day, Jehovah has commanded to be done so as to make atonement for YOU . + 35 And YOU will stay at the entrance of the tent of meeting day and night for seven days, + and YOU must keep the obligatory watch of Jehovah, + that YOU may not die; for so I have been commanded.” 36 And Aaron and his sons proceeded to do all the things that Jehovah had commanded by means of Moses.
