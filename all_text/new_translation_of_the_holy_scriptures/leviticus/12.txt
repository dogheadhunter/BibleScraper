She should not touch any holy thing, and she should not come into the holy place until the fulfilling of the days of her purification. + 5 “‘Now if she should bear a female, she must then be unclean fourteen days, * as during her menstruation. For sixty-six days more she will stay with the blood of purification. 6 Then at the fulfilling of the days of her purification for a son or for a daughter she will bring a young ram in its first year for a burnt offering + and a young pigeon * or a turtledove + for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting to the priest. 7 And he must present it before Jehovah and make atonement for her, and she must be clean from the source of her blood. + This is the law about her who bears either a male or a female. 8 But if she cannot afford * enough for a sheep, she must then take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, * + one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest must make atonement + for her, and she must be clean.’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “two weeks.” ^ Lit., “son of a pigeon.” ^ Lit., “if her hand cannot reach.” ^ Lit., “sons of a pigeon.” Previous Next Print Share Share
