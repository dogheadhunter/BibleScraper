We have heard it in Ephʹra·thah, + We have found it in the fields of the forest. + 7 Let us come into his grand tabernacle; + Let us bow down at his footstool. + 8 Do arise, O Jehovah, to your resting-place, + You and the ark + of your strength. + 9 Let your priests themselves be clothed with righteousness, + And let your own loyal ones cry out joyfully. + 10 On account of David your servant, + Do not turn back the face of your anointed one. * + 11 Jehovah has sworn to David, + Truly he will not draw back from it: * + “Of the fruitage of your belly + I shall set on your throne. + 12 If your sons will keep my covenant + And my reminders that I shall teach them, + Their sons also forever + Will sit upon your throne.” + 13 For Jehovah has chosen Zion; + He has longed for it * as a dwelling for himself: + 14 “This is my resting-place forever; + Here I shall dwell, for I have longed for it. + 15 Its * provisions I shall bless without fail. + Its poor ones I shall satisfy with bread. * + 16 And its priests I shall clothe with salvation; + And its loyal ones will without fail cry out joyfully. 17 There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. + I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. * + 18 His enemies I shall clothe with shame; + But upon him his diadem + will flourish.” * + Footnotes ^ Or, “grand residence.” Lit., “tabernacles,” but pl. to denote excellence. ^ “Your anointed one .” Heb., meshi·ch eʹkha; Gr., khri·stouʹ ; Syr., meshi·ch akh; Lat., chriʹsti . ^ Or, “a truth from which he will not draw back.” ^ Or, “her,” fem., referring to “Zion.” ^ Or, “food.” ^ See vs 13 ftn. ^ “For my anointed one .” Heb., li m·shi·ch iʹ; Gr., khri·stoiʹ ; Syr., la m·shi·ch eh; Lat., chriʹsto . ^ Or, “put forth blossoms.” Previous Next Print Share Share
