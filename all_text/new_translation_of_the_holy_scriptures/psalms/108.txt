A melody of David. 108 My heart is steadfast, O God. + I will sing and make melody, + Even my glory. + 2 Do awake, O stringed instrument; you too, O harp. + I will awaken the dawn. + 3 I shall laud you among the peoples, O Jehovah; + And I shall make melody to you among the national groups. + 4 For your loving-kindness * is great up to the heavens, + And your trueness up to the skies. + 5 O be exalted above the heavens, O God; + And let your glory be above all the earth. + 6 In order that your beloved ones may be rescued, + O do save with your right hand and answer me. + 7 God himself has spoken in his holiness: + “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem + as a portion; + And the low plain of Sucʹcoth + I shall measure off. 8 Gilʹe·ad + belongs to me; Ma·nasʹseh + belongs to me; And Eʹphra·im is the fortress of my head one; + Judah is my commander’s staff. + 9 Moʹab + is my washing pot. + Over Eʹdom + I shall throw my sandal. + Over Phi·lisʹti·a + I shall shout in triumph.” * + 10 Who will bring me to the fortified city? + Who will actually lead me as far as Eʹdom? + 11 Is it not [you], O God, who have cast us off + And who do not go forth with our armies as God? + 12 Do give us assistance from distress, + As salvation by earthling man * is worthless. + 13 By God we shall gain vital energy, + And he himself will tread down our adversaries. + Footnotes ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ See 60:8 and ftn. ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ .
