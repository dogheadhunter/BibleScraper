Of the sons of Koʹrah + upon The Maidens. * A song. 46 God * is for us a refuge and strength, + A help that is readily to be found during distresses. + 2 That is why we shall not fear, though the earth undergo change + And though the mountains totter into the heart of the vast sea; + 3 Though its waters be boisterous, foam over, + Though the mountains rock at its uproar. + Seʹlah. 4 There is a river the streams of which make the city of God rejoice, + The holiest grand tabernacle * of the Most High. + 5 God is in the midst of [the city]; * + it will not be made to totter. + God will help it at the appearance of morning. + 6 The nations became boisterous, + the kingdoms tottered; He sounded * with his voice, the earth proceeded to melt. + 7 Jehovah * of armies is with us; + The God * of Jacob is a secure height for us. + Seʹlah. 8 Come, YOU people, behold the activities of Jehovah, * + How he has set astonishing events on the earth. + 9 He is making wars to cease to the extremity * of the earth. + The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; + The wagons * he burns in the fire. + 10 “Give in, YOU people, and know that I am God. + I will be exalted among the nations, + I will be exalted in the earth.” + 11 Jehovah * of armies is with us; + The God of Jacob is a secure height for us. + Seʹlah.
