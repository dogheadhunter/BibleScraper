Of Jehovah’s servant, of David, who spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies and * out of the hand of Saul. + And he proceeded to say: 18 I shall have affection for you, * O Jehovah my strength. + 2 Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me. + My God * is my rock. I shall take refuge in him, * + My shield and my horn of salvation, my secure height. + 3 On the One to be praised, Jehovah, I shall call, + And from my enemies I shall be saved. + 4 The ropes of death encircled me; + Flash floods of good-for-nothing [men] * also kept terrifying me. + 5 The very ropes of Sheʹol surrounded me; + The snares of death confronted me. + 6 In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, And to my God * I kept crying for help. + Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, + And my own cry before him for help now came into his ears. + 7 And the earth began to shake and rock, + And the foundations of the mountains themselves became agitated, + And they kept shaking back and forth because he had been angered. + 8 Smoke went up at his nostrils, and fire itself from his mouth kept devouring; + Coals themselves blazed forth from him. 9 And he proceeded to bend the heavens down and descend. + And thick gloom was beneath his feet. 10 And he came riding upon a cherub and came flying, + And he came darting upon the wings of a spirit. * + 11 He then made darkness his concealment place, + All around him as his booth, Dark waters, * thick clouds. + 12 Out of the brightness in front of him there were his clouds that passed by, + Hail and burning coals of fire. + 13 And in the heavens Jehovah began to thunder, + And the Most High himself began to give his voice, + Hail and burning coals of fire. 14 And he kept sending out his arrows, that he might scatter them; + And lightnings he shot out, that he might throw them into confusion. + 15 And the streambeds of waters became visible, + And the foundations of the productive land * became uncovered + From your rebuke, O Jehovah, from the blast * of the breath * of your nostrils. * + 16 He was sending * from on high, he was taking me, + He was drawing me out of great waters. + 17 He was delivering me from my strong enemy, + And from those hating me; because they were stronger than I was. + 18 They kept confronting me in the day of my disaster, + But Jehovah came to be as a support for me. + 19 And he proceeded to bring me out into a roomy place; + He was rescuing me, because he had found delight in me. + 20 Jehovah rewards me according to my righteousness; + According to the cleanness of my hands he repays me. + 21 For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, + And I have not wickedly departed from my God. + 22 For all his judicial decisions are in front of me, + And his statutes I shall not remove from myself. + 23 And I will prove myself faultless with him, + And I shall keep myself from error on my part. + 24 And let Jehovah repay me according to my righteousness, + According to the cleanness of my hands in front of his eyes. + 25 With someone loyal * you will act in loyalty; * + With the faultless, able-bodied man you will deal faultlessly; + 26 With the one keeping clean you will show yourself clean; + And with the crooked one you will show yourself tortuous; * + 27 Because the afflicted * people you yourself will save; + But the haughty eyes you will abase. + 28 For you yourself will light my lamp, O Jehovah; + My God * himself will make my darkness shine. + 29 For by you I can run against a marauder band; + And by my God I can climb a wall. + 30 As for the [true] God, perfect is his way; + The saying of Jehovah * is a refined one. + A shield he is to all those taking refuge in him. + 31 For who is a God * besides Jehovah? * + And who is a rock except our God? * + 32 The [true] God is the One girding me closely with vital energy, + And he will grant my way to be perfect, + 33 Making my feet like those of the hinds, + And upon places high for me he keeps me standing. + 34 He is teaching my hands for warfare, * + And my arms have pressed down a bow of copper. + 35 And you will give me your shield of salvation, + And your own right hand will sustain me, + And your own humility will make me great. * + 36 You will make room large enough for my steps under me, + And my ankles will certainly not wobble. + 37 I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them; And I shall not return until they are exterminated. + 38 I shall break them in pieces so that they will not be able to rise up; + They will fall under my feet. + 39 And you will gird me with vital energy for warfare; You will make those rising against me collapse under me. + 40 And as for my enemies, you will certainly give me the back of [their] neck; * + And as for those hating me intensely, I shall silence them. + 41 They cry for help, but there is no savior, + To Jehovah, * but he actually does not answer them. + 42 And I shall pound them fine like dust before the wind; + Like the mire of the streets I shall pour them out. + 43 You will provide me escape from the faultfinding of the people. + You will appoint me the head of the nations. + A people that I have not known—they will serve me. + 44 At mere hearsay they will be obedient to me; + Foreigners * themselves will come cringing to me. + 45 Foreigners themselves will fade away, And they will come quaking out from their bulwarks. + 46 Jehovah * is living, + and blessed be my Rock, + And let the God of my salvation be exalted. + 47 The [true] God is the Giver of acts of vengeance to me; + And he subdues the peoples under me. + 48 He is providing escape for me from my angry enemies; + Above those who rise up against me you will lift me up, + From the man of violence you will deliver me. + 49 That is why I shall laud you among the nations, O Jehovah, + And to your name I will make melody. + 50 He is doing great acts of salvation for his king + And exercising loving-kindness * to his anointed one, * + To David and to his seed * to time indefinite. + Footnotes ^ Or, “especially.” ^ Or, “I shall exalt you,” by a correction of M. ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼE·l iʹ . ^ Or, “my rock in which I shall take refuge.” ^ Or, “of no usefulness.” Lit., “of belial.” ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aiʹ . ^ Or, “wings of wind [LXXVg, “ winds ”].” Heb., kan·pheh- ruʹach . ^ Lit., “darkness of waters.” ^ “The inhabited earth,” LXX (the same word as in Mt 24:14 ); Lat., orʹbis ter·raʹrum, “circle of the whole earth.” ^ “From the blast .” Heb., min· nish·mathʹ ; in Ge 2:7 , “breath.” ^ “Breath of.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma·tos; Lat., spiʹri·tus .
