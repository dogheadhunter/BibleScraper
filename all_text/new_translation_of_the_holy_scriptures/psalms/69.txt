My eyes have failed while waiting for my God. + 4 Those hating me without a cause have become even more than the hairs of my head. + Those bringing me to silence, being my enemies for no reason, have become numerous. + What I had not taken by robbery I then proceeded to give back. 5 O God, you yourself have come to know my foolishness, And from you my own guiltiness has not been hidden. + 6 O may those hoping in you not be ashamed because of me, + O Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies. + O may those seeking you not be humiliated because of me, + O God of Israel. + 7 For on your account I have borne reproach, + Humiliation has covered my face. + 8 I have become one estranged to my brothers, + And a foreigner to the sons of my mother. + 9 For sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up, + And the very reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me. + 10 And I proceeded to weep with the fasting of my soul, + But it came to be for reproaches to me. + 11 When I made sackcloth my clothing, Then I became to them a proverbial saying. + 12 Those sitting in the gate began concerning themselves about me, + And [I was] the subject of the songs of drinkers of intoxicating liquor. + 13 But as for me, my prayer was to you, O Jehovah, * + At an acceptable time, O God. + In the abundance of your loving-kindness answer me with the truth of salvation by you. + 14 Deliver me from the mire, that I may not sink down. + O may I be delivered from those hating me + and from the deep waters. + 15 O may not the flowing stream of waters wash me away, + Nor the depth swallow me up, Nor the well close its mouth over me. + 16 Answer me, O Jehovah, for your loving-kindness is good. + According to the multitude of your mercies turn to me, + 17 And do not conceal your face from your servant. + Because I am in sore straits, answer me quickly. + 18 Do come near to my soul, reclaim it; + On account of my enemies redeem me. + 19 You yourself have come to know my reproach and my shame and my humiliation. + All those showing hostility to me are in front of you. + 20 Reproach itself has broken my heart, and [the wound] is incurable. + And I kept hoping for someone to show sympathy, but there was none; + And for comforters, but I found none. + 21 But for food * they gave [me] a poisonous plant, * + And for my thirst they tried to make me drink vinegar. + 22 Let their table before them become a trap, + And what is for their welfare a snare. + 23 Let their eyes become darkened so as not to see; + And cause their very hips to wobble constantly. + 24 Pour out upon them your denunciation, + And may your own burning anger overtake them. + 25 Let their walled camp become desolate; + In their tents may there come to be no dweller. + 26 For the one whom you yourself have struck they have pursued, + And the pains of those pierced by you they keep recounting. 27 Do give error upon their error, + And may they not come into your righteousness. + 28 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living ones, * + And with the righteous ones may they not be written in. + 29 But I am afflicted and aching. + May your own salvation, O God, protect me. + 30 I will praise the name of God * with song, + And I will magnify him with thanksgiving. + 31 This will also be more pleasing to Jehovah * than a bull, + Than a young bull displaying horns, splitting the hoof. + 32 The meek ones will certainly see [it]; they will rejoice. + Y OU who are seeking God, let YOUR heart also keep alive. + 33 For Jehovah is listening to the poor ones, + And he will indeed not despise his very own prisoners. * + 34 Let heaven and earth praise him, + The seas and everything moving about in them. + 35 For God himself will save Zion + And will build the cities of Judah; + And they will certainly dwell there and take possession of it. * + 36 And the offspring * of his servants themselves will inherit it, + And those loving his name will be the ones to reside in it. + Footnotes ^ See 45:Sup ftn, “Lilies.” ^ Or, “life.” Heb., naʹphesh; T(Aram.)­Syr., naph·shaʼ; Gr., psy·khesʹ; Lat., aʹni·mam . ^ “And a flowing stream .” Heb., we shib·boʹleth . ^ “Jehovah.” Heb., Yehwahʹ; Fragment Sym P.
