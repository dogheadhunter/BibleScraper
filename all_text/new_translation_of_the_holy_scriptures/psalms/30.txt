A song of inauguration of the house. + Of David. 30 I shall exalt you, O Jehovah, * for you have drawn me up + And you have not let my enemies rejoice over me. + 2 O Jehovah * my God, I cried to you for help, and you proceeded to heal me. + 3 O Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheʹol * itself; + You have kept me alive, that I should not go down into the pit. + 4 Make melody to Jehovah, * O YOU loyal ones of his, + Give thanks to his holy memorial; * + 5 Because being under his anger is for a moment, + Being under his goodwill is for a lifetime. + In the evening weeping may take up lodging, + but in the morning there is a joyful cry. + 6 As for me, I have said in my ease: + “Never shall I be made to totter.” + 7 O Jehovah, * in your goodwill you have made my mountain to stand in strength. + You concealed your face; I became one that is disturbed. + 8 To you, O Jehovah, * I kept calling; + And to Jehovah * I kept making entreaty for favor. + 9 What profit is there in my blood when I go down to the pit? * + Will the dust laud you? + Will it tell of your trueness? * + 10 Hear, O Jehovah, * and show me favor. + O Jehovah, * prove yourself my helper. + 11 You have changed my mourning into dancing for me; + You have loosened my sackcloth, and you keep me girded with rejoicing, + 12 In order that [my] glory * may make melody to you and not keep silent. + O Jehovah * my God, to time indefinite I will laud you. + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §10. ^ See App 1C §10. ^ “Sheol.” Heb., sheʼohlʹ; Gr., haiʹdou; Lat., in·ferʹno .
