To the director over Maʹha·lath * for making responses. Masʹkil * of Heʹman + the Ezʹra·hite. 88 O Jehovah, the God of my salvation, + By day I have cried out, + In the night [also] in front of you. + 2 Before you my prayer will come. + Incline your ear to my entreating cry. + 3 For my soul has had enough of calamities, + And my very life has come in touch even with Sheʹol. * + 4 I have been reckoned in among those going down to the pit; + I have become like an able-bodied man without strength, + 5 Set free among the dead themselves, + Like slain ones lying in the burial place, + Whom you have remembered no longer And who have been severed from your own [helping] hand. + 6 You have put me in a pit of the lowest depths, In dark places, in a large abyss. * + 7 Upon me your rage has thrown itself, + And with all your breaking waves you have afflicted [me]. + Seʹlah. 8 You have put my acquaintances far away from me; + You have set me as something very detestable to them. + I am under restraint and cannot go forth. + 9 My own eye has languished because of my affliction. + I have called on you, O Jehovah, all day long; + To you I have spread out my palms. + 10 For those who are dead will you do a marvel? + Or will those impotent in death * themselves arise, + Will they laud you? + Seʹlah. 11 Will your loving-kindness be declared in the burial place * itself, Your faithfulness in [the place of] destruction? * + 12 Will a marvel by you be known in the darkness itself, + Or your righteousness in the land of oblivion? + 13 And yet to you, O Jehovah, I myself have cried for help, + And in the morning my own prayer keeps confronting you. + 14 Why is it, O Jehovah, that you cast off my soul? + Why do you keep your face concealed from me? + 15 I am afflicted and about to expire from boyhood on; + I have borne frightful things from you very much. * + 16 Over me your flashes of burning anger have passed; + Terrors from you yourself have brought me to silence. + 17 They have surrounded me like waters all day long; + They have closed in upon me all at one time. 18 You have put far away from me friend and companion; + My acquaintances are a dark place. + Footnotes ^ See 53:Sup ftn, “Mahalath.” ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ “With Sheol .” Heb., li sh·ʼohlʹ ; Gr., haiʹdei ; Lat., in·ferʹno .
