Of David. 11 * In Jehovah I have taken refuge. + How dare YOU men say to my soul: “Flee as a bird to YOUR mountain!” + 2 For, look! the wicked ones themselves bend the bow, + They do make ready their arrow upon the bowstring, To shoot in the gloom at the ones upright in heart. + 3 When the foundations themselves are torn down, + What must anyone righteous do? 4 Jehovah is in his holy temple. + Jehovah—in the heavens is his throne. + His own eyes behold, his own beaming eyes * examine + the sons of men. * 5 Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, + And anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates. + 6 He will rain down upon the wicked ones traps, fire and sulphur + And a scorching wind, as the portion of their cup. + 7 For Jehovah is righteous; + he does love righteous acts. + The upright are the ones that will behold his face. + Footnotes ^ LXXVg combine the two preceding psalms, and make this Ps 10 , thereby changing the numbering of the psalms that follow. ^ Or, “of earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “his eyelids.” Previous Next Print Share Share
