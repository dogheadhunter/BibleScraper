A melody. 101 About loving-kindness and judgment I will sing. + To you, O Jehovah, I will make melody. + 2 I will act with discretion in a faultless way. + When will you come to me? + I shall walk about in the integrity of my heart inside my house. + 3 I shall not set in front of my eyes any good-for-nothing thing. * + The doing of those who fall away I have hated; + It does not cling to me. + 4 A crooked heart departs from me; + Nothing bad do I know. + 5 Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, + Him I silence. + Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, * + Him I cannot endure. + 6 My eyes are upon the faithful ones of the earth, + That they may dwell with me. + The one walking in a faultless way, + He it is who will minister to me. + 7 There will dwell inside my house no worker of trickiness. + As for anyone speaking falsehoods, he will not be firmly established + In front of my eyes. + 8 Every morning * I shall silence all the wicked ones of the earth, + To cut off from the city + of Jehovah all the practicers of what is hurtful. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “a thing of belial (worthlessness).” ^ Lit., “Anyone high of eyes and broad of heart.” ^ Lit., “For the mornings.” Previous Next Print Share Share
