May my enemies not exult over me. + ג [ Giʹmel ] 3 Also, none of those hoping in you will be ashamed. + They will be ashamed who are dealing treacherously without success. + ד [ Daʹleth ] 4 Make me know your own ways, O Jehovah; + Teach me your own paths. + ה [ He ʼ] 5 Make me walk in your truth and teach me, + For you are my God of salvation. + ו [ Waw ] * In you I have hoped all day long. + ז [ Zaʹyin ] 6 Remember your mercies, + O Jehovah, and your loving-kindnesses, * + For they are from time indefinite. + ח [ Chehth ] 7 The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. + According to your loving-kindness do you yourself remember me, + For the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah. + ט [ Tehth ] 8 Good and upright is Jehovah. + That is why he instructs sinners in the way. + י [ Yohdh ] 9 He will cause the meek ones to walk in [his] judicial decision, + And he will teach the meek ones his way. + כ [ Kaph ] 10 All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness and trueness * For those observing his covenant * + and his reminders. + ל [ Laʹmedh ] 11 For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, + You must even forgive my error, for it is considerable. + מ [ Mem ] 12 Who, now, is the man fearful of Jehovah? + He will instruct him in the way [that] he will choose. + נ [ Nun ] 13 His own soul will lodge in goodness itself, + And his own offspring * will take possession of the earth. + ס [ Saʹmekh ] 14 The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him, + Also his covenant, to cause them to know it. + ע [ ʽAʹyin ] 15 My eyes are constantly toward Jehovah, + For he it is that brings my feet out of the net. + פ [ Peʼ ] 16 Turn your face to me, and show me favor; + For I am solitary * and afflicted. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 17 Distresses of my heart have multiplied; + From the stresses upon me O bring me out. + ר [ Rehsh ] * 18 See my affliction and my trouble, + And pardon all my sins. + 19 * See how many my enemies have become, + And with a violent hatred they have hated me. + ש [ Shin ] 20 Do guard my soul and deliver me. + May I not be ashamed, for I have taken refuge in you. + ת [ Taw ] 21 Let integrity and uprightness themselves safeguard me, + For I have hoped in you. + 22 O God, * redeem Israel out of all his distresses. + Footnotes ^ In M this psalm is arranged in acrostic, or Heb. alphabetic, order. ^ “O my God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aiʹ . This expression in M begins this vs with another ʼAʹleph . “In you” begins with the Heb. letter Behth . ^ The letter Waw ( ו ) as an acrostic appears in four Heb. mss. ^ Or, “your acts of loyal love.” ^ “His covenant .” Heb., veri·th ohʹ, the first occurrence of this word in Psalms; Gr., di·a·theʹken ; Lat., te·sta·menʹtum . See App 7E . ^ Or, “truthfulness; truth.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or, “the only one.” Gr., mo·no·ge·nesʹ, “the only-begotten,” the same word as in Lu 7:12; Lu 8:42; Joh 3:16 . ^ In this acrostic the letter Qohph is missing between Tsa·dhehʹ and Rehsh . ^ This vs, like vs 18, begins with the Heb. letter Rehsh, giving twofold emphasis in the acrostic to ‘seeing.’ ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ .
