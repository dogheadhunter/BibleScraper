+ Reside in the earth, and deal with faithfulness. + 4 Also take exquisite delight in Jehovah, + And he will give you the requests of your heart. + ג [ Giʹmel ] 5 Roll upon Jehovah your way, + And rely upon him, + and he himself will act. + 6 And he will certainly bring forth your righteousness as the light itself, + And your justice as the midday. + ד [ Daʹleth ] 7 Keep silent before Jehovah + And wait longingly for him. + Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful, + At the man carrying out [his] ideas. + ה [ He ʼ] 8 Let anger alone and leave rage; + Do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. + 9 For evildoers themselves will be cut off, + But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. + ו [ Waw ] 10 And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; + And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. + 11 But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, + And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. + ז [ Zaʹyin ] 12 The wicked one is plotting against the righteous one, + And at him he is grinding his teeth. + 13 Jehovah * himself will laugh at him, + For he certainly sees that his day will come. + ח [ Chehth ] 14 The wicked ones have drawn a sword itself and have bent their bow, + To cause the afflicted and poor one to fall, + To slaughter those who are upright in [their] way. + 15 Their own sword will enter into their heart, + And their own bows will be broken. + ט [ Tehth ] 16 Better is the little of the righteous one + Than the abundance of the many wicked ones. + 17 For the very arms of the wicked ones will be broken, + But Jehovah will be supporting the righteous ones. + י [ Yohdh ] 18 Jehovah is aware of the days of the faultless ones, + And their very inheritance will continue even to time indefinite. + 19 They will not be ashamed in the time of calamity, + And in the days of famine they will be satisfied. + כ [ Kaph ] 20 For the wicked themselves will perish, + And the enemies of Jehovah will be like the preciousness of pastures; They must come to their end. + In smoke they must come to their end. + ל [ Laʹmedh ] 21 The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back, + But the righteous one is showing favor and is making gifts. + 22 For those being blessed by him will themselves possess the earth, + But those upon whom evil is called by him will be cut off. + מ [ Mem ] 23 By Jehovah the very steps of an able-bodied man have been made ready, + And in his way He takes delight. + 24 Although he may fall, he will not be hurled down, + For Jehovah is supporting his hand. + נ [ Nun ] 25 A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, + And yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, + Nor his offspring * looking for bread. + 26 All day long he is showing favor and lending, + And so his offspring are in line for a blessing. + ס [ Saʹmekh ] 27 Turn away from what is bad and do what is good, + And so reside to time indefinite. + 28 For Jehovah is a lover of justice, + And he will not leave his loyal ones. + ע [ ʽAʹyin ] To * time indefinite they will certainly be guarded; + But as for the offspring of the wicked ones, they will indeed be cut off. + 29 The righteous themselves will possess the earth, + And they will reside forever upon it. + פ [ Peʼ ] 30 The mouth of the righteous is the one that utters wisdom in an undertone, + And his is the tongue that speaks justly. + 31 The law of his God is in his heart; + His steps will not wobble. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 32 The wicked one is keeping on the watch for the righteous + And is seeking to put him to death. + 33 As for Jehovah, he will not leave him to the hand of that one, + And he will not pronounce him wicked when he is being judged. + ק [ Qohph ] 34 Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, + And he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. + When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see [it]. + ר [ Rehsh ] 35 I have seen the wicked a tyrant + And spreading himself * as a luxuriant [tree] in native soil. + 36 And yet he proceeded to pass away, * and there he was not; + And I kept seeking him, and he was not found. + ש [ Shin ] 37 Watch the blameless one and keep the upright one in sight, + For the future of [that] man will be peaceful. + 38 But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together; + The future of wicked people will indeed be cut off. + ת [ Taw ] 39 And * the salvation of the righteous ones is from Jehovah; + He is their fortress in the time of distress. + 40 And Jehovah will help them and provide them with escape. + He will provide them with escape from wicked people and save them, + Because they have taken refuge in him. + Footnotes ^ In M this psalm is arranged in acrostic, or Heb. alphabetic, order. ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ . See App 1B . ^ Or, “seed.” ^ By dropping the preposition “to” ( ל ), this line begins with the acrostic Heb. letter ʽAʹyin . ^ Lit., “pouring himself out.” ^ According to M; LXXSyVg, “I passed by.” ^ By dropping the conjunction “and” ( ו ), this line begins with an acrostic Taw, the last letter of the Heb. alphabet.
