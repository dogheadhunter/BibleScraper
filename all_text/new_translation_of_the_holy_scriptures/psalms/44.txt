Of the sons of Koʹrah. + Masʹkil. * 44 O God, with our ears we have heard, Our forefathers themselves have recounted to us + The activity that you performed in their days, + In the days of long ago. + 2 You yourself by your hand drove away even nations, + And you proceeded to plant them [instead]. + You went breaking national groups and sending them away. + 3 For it was not by their own sword that they took possession of the land, + And their own arm was not what brought them salvation. + For it was your right hand and your arm + and the light of your face, Because you took pleasure in them. + 4 You yourself are my King, O God. + Command grand salvation * for Jacob. + 5 By you we shall push our adversaries themselves; + In your name we shall tread down those rising up against us. + 6 For it was not in my bow that I kept trusting + And it was not my sword that was saving me. + 7 For you saved us from our adversaries, + And those intensely hating us you put to shame. + 8 In God we will offer praise all day long, + And to time indefinite your name we shall laud. + Seʹlah. 9 But now you have cast off and keep humiliating us, + And you do not go forth with our armies. + 10 You keep making us turn back from the adversary, + And the very ones intensely hating us have pillaged for themselves. + 11 You give us up like sheep, as something to eat, + And among the nations you have scattered us. + 12 You sell your people for no value at all, + And you have made no wealth by the price for them. 13 You set us as a reproach to our neighbors, + A derision and jeering to those all around us. + 14 You set us as a proverbial saying among the nations, + A shaking of the head among the national groups. + 15 All day long my humiliation is in front of me, And the shame of my own face has covered me, + 16 Due to the voice of the one reproaching and speaking abusively, Because of the enemy and the one taking his revenge. + 17 All this is what has come upon us, and we have not forgotten you, + And we have not acted falsely in your covenant. + 18 Our heart has not turned faithlessly back, + Nor do our footsteps deviate from your path. + 19 For you have crushed us in the place of jackals, + And you cover us over with deep shadow. + 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, * Or we spread out our palms to a strange god, * + 21 Will not God himself search this out? + For he is aware of the secrets of the heart. + 22 But for your sake we have been killed all day long; We have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering. + 23 Do arouse yourself. Why do you keep sleeping, O Jehovah? * + Do awake. Do not keep casting off forever. + 24 Why do you keep your very face concealed? Why do you forget our affliction and our oppression? + 25 For our soul has bowed down * to the dust itself; + Our belly has clung to the very earth. 26 Do arise in assistance to us + And redeem us for the sake of your loving-kindness. + Footnotes ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ See 42:5 ftn, “Salvation.” ^ “To . . . god .” Heb., le ʼelʹ . ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
