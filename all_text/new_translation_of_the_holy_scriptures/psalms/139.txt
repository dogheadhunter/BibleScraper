Of David. A melody. 139 O Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know [me]. + 2 You yourself have come to know my sitting down and my rising up. + You have considered my thought from far off. + 3 My journeying and my lying outstretched you have measured off, + And you have become familiar even with all my ways. + 4 For there is not a word on my tongue, + But, look! O Jehovah, you already know it all. + 5 Behind and before, you have besieged me; And you place your hand upon me. 6 [Such] knowledge is too wonderful for me. + It is so high up that I cannot attain to it. + 7 Where can I go from your spirit, * + And where can I run away from your face? + 8 If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; + And if I should spread out my couch in Sheʹol, * look! you [would be there]. + 9 Were I to take the wings + of the dawn, That I might reside in the most remote sea, + 10 There, also, your own hand would lead me + And your right hand would lay hold of me. + 11 And were I to say: “Surely darkness itself will hastily seize me!” + Then night would be light about me. + 12 Even the darkness itself would not prove too dark for you, + But night itself would shine just as the day does; + The darkness might just as well be the light. * + 13 For you yourself produced my kidneys; + You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother. + 14 I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. + Your works are wonderful, + As my soul is very well aware. + 15 My bones were not hidden from you + When I was made in secret, + When I was woven in the lowest parts * + of the earth. 16 Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, + And in your book all its parts were down in writing, As regards the days when they were formed + And there was not yet one among them. 17 So, to me how precious your thoughts are! + O God, * how much does the grand sum of them amount to! + 18 Were I to try to count them, they are more than even the grains of sand. + I have awaked, * and yet I am still with you. + 19 O that you, O God, * would slay the wicked one! + Then even the bloodguilty men * + will certainly depart from me, 20 Who say things about you according to [their] idea; + They have taken up [your name] in a worthless way + —your adversaries. + 21 Do I not hate those who are intensely hating you, O Jehovah, + And do I not feel a loathing for those revolting against you? + 22 With a complete hatred I do hate them. + They have become to me real enemies. + 23 Search through me, O God, * and know my heart. + Examine me, and know my disquieting thoughts, + 24 And see whether there is in me any painful way, + And lead me in the way + of time indefinite.
