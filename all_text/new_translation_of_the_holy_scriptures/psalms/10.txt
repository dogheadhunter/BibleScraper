He carries off the afflicted one by force when he draws his net shut. + 10 He is crushed, he bows down, And the army of dejected ones * has to fall into his strong [claws]. + 11 He has said in his heart: + “God has forgotten. + He has concealed his face. + He will certainly never see [it].” + ק [ Qohph ] 12 Do arise, + O Jehovah. O God, * lift up your hand. + Do not forget the afflicted ones. + 13 Why is it that the wicked one has disrespected God? * + He has said in his heart: “You will not require an accounting.” + ר [ Rehsh ] 14 For you yourself have seen trouble and vexation. You keep looking on, to get [them] into your hand. + To you the unfortunate + one, the fatherless boy, commits [himself]. You yourself have become [his] helper. + ש [ Shin ] 15 Break the arm of the wicked and bad one. + May you search after his wickedness [until] you find no more. + 16 Jehovah is King to time indefinite, even forever. + The nations have perished out of his earth. + ת [ Taw ] 17 The desire of the meek ones you will certainly hear, + O Jehovah. You will prepare their heart. + You will pay attention with your ear, + 18 To judge the fatherless boy and the crushed one, + That mortal man who is of the earth may no more cause trembling. * + Footnotes ^ In LXXVg this psalm is combined with the preceding psalm to make one psalm of 39 vss. In M the alphabetic acrostic continues from Ps 9 through Ps 10 , which begins with the 12th letter of the Heb. alphabet, Laʹmedh . ^ “Keep yourself hid,” in agreement with T. ^ Lit., “according to the height of his nose.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “Prospering,” by a correction; M, “enduring.” ^ “Settlements,” M; by a slight change of vowel pointing, “green grass.” ^ “Someone unfortunate.” The meaning in M is uncertain. Some read this as “your military forces,” but this does not suit the context. ^ “The army of dejected ones.” The meaning in M is uncertain. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ, pl. of ʼElohʹah . ^ Or, “that mortal man may no more continue to move tremblingly out of the earth.” Previous Next Print Share Share
