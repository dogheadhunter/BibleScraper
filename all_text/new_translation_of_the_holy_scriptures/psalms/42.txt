Masʹkil * for the sons of Koʹrah. + 42 As the hind that longs for the water streams, So my very soul longs for you, O God. * + 2 My soul indeed thirsts for God, + for the living God. * + When shall I come and appear [before] * God? + 3 To me my tears have become food day and night, + While [they] * say to me all day long: “Where is your God?” + 4 These things I will remember, and I will pour out my soul within me. + For I used to pass along with the throng, I used to walk slowly before them to the house of God, * + With the voice of a joyful cry and thanksgiving, + Of a crowd celebrating a festival. + 5 Why are you in despair, O my soul, + And why are you boisterous within me? + Wait for God, + For I shall yet laud him as the grand salvation * of my person. * + 6 O my God, * within me my very soul is in despair. + That is why I remember you, + From the land of Jordan and the peaks of Herʹmon, * + From the little mountain. * + 7 Watery deep to watery deep * is calling At the sound of your (water-) spouts. * All your breakers and your waves + — Over me they have passed. + 8 By day Jehovah will command his loving-kindness, * + And by night his song will be with me; + There will be prayer to the God of my life. * + 9 I will say to God my crag: + “Why have you forgotten me? + Why do I walk sad because of the oppression of the enemy?” + 10 With murder against my bones those showing hostility to me have reproached me, + While they say to me all day long: “Where is your God?” + 11 Why are you in despair, O my soul, + And why are you boisterous within me? + Wait for God, + For I shall yet laud him as the grand salvation of my person * and as my God. * + Footnotes ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ “O God,” MLXXVg; TSy, “O Jehovah.” ^ “For the living God .” Heb., le ʼElʹ chai . ^ “And appear [before].” Heb., we ʼe·ra·ʼehʹ penehʹ .
