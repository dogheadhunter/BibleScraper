Mikʹtam. * Of David. For teaching. + When he engaged in a struggle with Aʹram-na·ha·raʹim and Aʹram-Zoʹbah, and Joʹab proceeded to return and strike down Eʹdom in the Valley of Salt, even twelve thousand. + 60 O God, you have cast us off, you have broken through us, + You have become incensed. You should restore us. + 2 You have caused the earth to rock, you have split it open. + Heal its breaches, for it has tottered. + 3 You have caused your people to see hardship. + You have made us drink wine sending us reeling. + 4 You have given to those fearing you a signal + To flee zigzag * on account of the bow. Seʹlah. 5 In order that your beloved ones may be rescued, + O do save with your right hand and answer us. * + 6 God himself has spoken in his holiness: + “I will exult, I will give out Sheʹchem as a portion; + And the low plain of Sucʹcoth I shall measure off. + 7 Gilʹe·ad belongs to me and Ma·nasʹseh belongs to me, + And Eʹphra·im is the fortress of my head one; Judah is my commander’s staff. + 8 Moʹab is my washing pot. + Over Eʹdom I shall throw my sandal. + Over Phi·lisʹti·a I shall shout in triumph.” * + 9 Who will bring me to the besieged city? + Who will certainly lead me as far as Eʹdom? + 10 Is it not you, O God, who have cast us off + And who do not go forth with our armies as God? + 11 Do give us assistance from distress, + As salvation by earthling man is worthless. + 12 By God we shall gain vital energy, + And he himself will tread down our adversaries. + Footnotes ^ See 16:Sup ftn. ^ “To run zigzag,” by one derivation of the root verb; by a different root word, “for it to be displayed,” or, “to rally around.” ^ “Us,” M; M margin TLXXSyVg and many Heb. mss, “me.” ^ According to Sy; T, “Over the Philistines the congregation of Israel jubilates.” Previous Next Print Share Share
