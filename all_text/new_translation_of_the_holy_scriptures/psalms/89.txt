+ Who can resemble Jehovah among the sons of God? * + 7 God * is to be held in awe among the intimate group of holy ones; + He is grand and fear-inspiring over all who are round about him. + 8 O Jehovah God of armies, + Who is vigorous like you, O Jah? * + And your faithfulness is all around you. + 9 You are ruling over the swelling of the sea; + When it raises up its waves you yourself calm them. + 10 You yourself have crushed Raʹhab, * + even as someone slain. + By the arm of your strength you have scattered your enemies. + 11 Heaven is yours, + the earth also is yours; + The productive land * and what fills it + —you yourself have founded them. + 12 The north and the south * —you yourself created them; + Taʹbor + and Herʹmon + —in your name they cry out joyfully. + 13 An arm with mightiness is yours, + Your hand is strong, + Your right hand is exalted. + 14 Righteousness and judgment are the established place of your throne; + Loving-kindness and trueness * themselves come in before your face. + 15 Happy are the people knowing the joyful shouting. + O Jehovah, in the light of your face they keep walking. + 16 In your name they are joyful all day long + And in your righteousness they are exalted. + 17 For you are the beauty of their strength; + And by your goodwill our horn is exalted. + 18 For our shield belongs to Jehovah, + And our king belongs to the Holy One of Israel. + 19 At that time you spoke in a vision to your loyal ones, + And you proceeded to say: “I have placed help upon a mighty one; + I have exalted a chosen one from among the people. + 20 I have found David my servant; + With my holy oil I have anointed him, + 21 With whom my own hand will be firm, + Whom my own arm also will strengthen. + 22 No enemy will make exactions upon him, + Neither will any son of unrighteousness afflict him. + 23 And from before him I crushed his adversaries to pieces, + And to those intensely hating him I kept dealing out blows. + 24 And my faithfulness and my loving-kindness are with him, + And in my name his horn is exalted. + 25 And on the sea I have put his hand + And on the rivers his right hand. + 26 He himself calls out to me, ‘You are my Father, + My God + and the Rock of my salvation.’ + 27 Also, I myself shall place him as firstborn, + The most high of the kings of the earth. + 28 To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, + And my covenant will be faithful * to him. + 29 And I shall certainly set up his seed forever + And his throne as the days of heaven. + 30 If his sons leave my law + And in my judicial decisions they do not walk, + 31 If they profane my own statutes And they do not keep my own commandments, 32 I must also turn my attention to their transgression even with a rod + And to their error even with strokes. + 33 But my loving-kindness * I shall not break off from him, + Nor shall I prove false with regard to my faithfulness. + 34 I shall not profane my covenant, + And the expression out of my lips I shall not change. + 35 Once I have sworn in my holiness, + To David I will not tell lies. + 36 His seed itself will prove to be even to time indefinite, + And his throne as the sun in front of me. + 37 As the moon it will be firmly established for time indefinite, And [as] a faithful witness in the skies.” Seʹlah. 38 But you—you have cast off and you keep contemning; + You have become furious toward your anointed one. * + 39 You have spurned the covenant of your servant; You have profaned his diadem to the very earth. + 40 You have broken down all his stone pens; + You have laid his fortifications in ruin. + 41 All those passing along the way have pillaged him; + He has become a reproach to his neighbors. + 42 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; + You have caused all his enemies to rejoice. + 43 What is more, you again treat his sword as a foe, + And you have caused him not to gain ground in the battle. + 44 You have made [him] cease from his luster, + And his throne you have hurled to the very earth. + 45 You have shortened the days of his youth; You have enwrapped him with shame. + Seʹlah. 46 How long, O Jehovah, will you keep yourself concealed? For all time? + Will your rage keep on burning just like a fire? + 47 Remember of what duration of life I am. + Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? * + 48 What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? + Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheʹol? + Seʹlah. 49 Where are your former acts of loving-kindness, O Jehovah, * About which you swore to David in your faithfulness? + 50 Remember, O Jehovah, * the reproach upon your servants, + My carrying in my bosom [the reproach of] all the many peoples, + 51 How your enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, * + How they have reproached the footprints of your anointed one. + 52 Blessed be Jehovah * to time indefinite.
