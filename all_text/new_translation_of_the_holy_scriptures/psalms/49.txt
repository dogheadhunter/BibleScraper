Of the sons of Koʹrah. + A melody. 49 Hear this, all YOU peoples. Give ear, all YOU inhabitants of the system of things, * + 2 Y OU sons of humankind * as well as YOU sons of man, * You rich one and you poor one together. + 3 My own mouth will speak things of wisdom, + And the meditation of my heart will be of things of understanding. + 4 To a proverbial utterance I shall incline my ear; + On a harp I shall open up my riddle. + 5 Why should I be afraid in the days of evil, + [When] the very error of my supplanters * surrounds me? + 6 Those who are trusting in their means of maintenance, + And who keep boasting about the abundance of their riches, + 7 Not one of them * can by any means redeem even a brother, + Nor give to God a ransom for him; * 8 (And the redemption price of their * soul is so precious + That it has ceased to time indefinite) 9 That he should still live forever [and] not see the pit. + 10 For he sees that even the wise ones die, + Together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, + And they must leave to others their means of maintenance. + 11 Their inward wish * is that their houses may be to time indefinite, + Their tabernacles to generation after generation. + They have called their landed estates by their names. + 12 And yet earthling man, * though in honor, cannot keep lodging; + He is indeed comparable with the beasts that have been destroyed. * + 13 This is the way of those who have stupidity, + And of those coming after them who take pleasure in their very mouthings. * Seʹlah. 14 Like sheep they have been appointed * to Sheʹol itself; + Death itself will shepherd * them; + And the upright ones will have them in subjection in the morning, + And their forms * are due to wear away; + Sheʹol rather than a lofty abode is for each one. * + 15 However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheʹol, + For he will receive me. Seʹlah. 16 Do not be afraid because some man gains riches, + Because the glory of his house increases, + 17 For at his death he cannot take along anything at all; + His glory will not go down along with him himself. + 18 For during his lifetime he kept blessing his own soul; + (And people will laud you because you do well for yourself) + 19 [His soul] * finally comes only as far as the generation of his forefathers. + Nevermore will they see the light. + 20 Earthling man, although in honor, who does not understand, * + Is indeed comparable with the beasts that have been destroyed. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the duration of life.” Heb., chaʹledh . ^ “Humankind.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “Supplanters,” by a change of vowel pointing; M, “heels.” ^ “One of them.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “a ransom for himself.” Lit., “his cover .” Heb., koph·r ohʹ . ^ “Their,” MSy; LXXVg, “his.” ^ “Their inward wish,” M; LXXSyVg, “Their graves.” ^ “And yet earthling man .” Heb., we ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “silenced.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ “Their rock,” M margin . ^ Or, “for him,” that is, for each one in the group. ^ Or, “pasture [tend].” ^ Lit., “they have appointed [them].” By a correction of the verb, “they will descend (drop).” ^ Lit., “it,” fem., referring to the “soul.” ^ “Who does not understand,” M; by altering the Heb. verb form in harmony with vs 12a, “even does not keep lodging.” Previous Next Print Share Share
