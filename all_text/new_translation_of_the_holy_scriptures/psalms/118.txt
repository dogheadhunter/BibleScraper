I shall go into them; I shall laud Jah. * + 20 This is the gate of Jehovah. + The righteous themselves will go into it. + 21 I shall laud you, for you answered me + And you came to be my salvation. + 22 The stone that the builders rejected + Has become the head of the corner. + 23 This has come to be from Jehovah himself; + It * is wonderful in our eyes. + 24 This is the day that Jehovah has made; * + We will be joyful and rejoice in it. + 25 Ah, now, Jehovah, do save, please! + Ah, now, Jehovah, do grant success, please! + 26 Blessed be the One coming in the name of Jehovah; + We have blessed YOU people out of the house of Jehovah. + 27 Jehovah is the Divine One, * + And he gives us light. + Bind the festival procession + with boughs, + O YOU people, As far as the horns of the altar. + 28 You are my Divine One, and I shall laud you; + My God * —I shall exalt you. + 29 Give thanks to Jehovah, YOU people, for he is good; + For his loving-kindness is to time indefinite. + Footnotes ^ See 68:4 ftn. ^ “He answered me with the roomy (spacious) place of Jah,” according to many Heb. mss. ^ Or, “Jehovah is mine (belongs to me).” ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Possibly, “Jah is my strength and [my] melody.” ^ “Me,” LXXSyVg. ^ “Jah.” Heb., Yah; LXXSyVg, “Jehovah.” ^ See 68:4 ftn. ^ “This . . . it,” both fem., possibly referring to “the stone,” fem., in vs 22. ^ Or, “This is the day that Jehovah has done [it].” ^ “Divine One.” Or, “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aiʹ .
