Of David. A melody, a song. 68 Let God arise, + let his enemies be scattered, + And let those who intensely hate him flee because of him. + 2 As smoke is driven away, may you drive [them] away; + As wax melts because of the fire, + Let the wicked ones perish from before God. + 3 But as for the righteous, let them rejoice, + Let them be elated before God, + And let them exult with rejoicing. + 4 Sing YOU to God, make melody to his name; + Raise up [a song] to the One riding through the desert plains + As Jah, * which is his name; + and jubilate before him; 5 A father of fatherless boys and a judge of widows + Is God in his holy dwelling. + 6 God is causing the solitary ones to dwell in * a house; + He is bringing forth prisoners into full prosperity. + However, as for the stubborn, they have to reside in a scorched land. + 7 O God, when you went forth before your people, + When you marched through the desert + — Seʹlah — 8 The earth itself rocked, + Heaven itself also dripped because of God; + This Siʹnai [rocked] because of God, + the God of Israel. + 9 A copious downpour you began causing to fall, O God; + Your inheritance, even when it was weary—you yourself reinvigorated it. + 10 Your tent community + —they have dwelt in it; + With your goodness you proceeded to make it ready for the afflicted one, O God. + 11 Jehovah * himself gives the saying; + The women telling the good news are a large army. + 12 Even the kings of armies flee, they flee. + As for her who abides at home, she shares in the spoil. + 13 Although YOU men kept lying between the [camp] ash heaps, * There will be the wings of a dove covered with silver And its pinions with yellowish-green gold. * + 14 When the Almighty One * scattered * abroad the kings in it, * + It began to snow in Zalʹmon. + 15 The mountainous region * of Baʹshan + is a mountain of God; * + The mountainous region of Baʹshan is a mountain of peaks. + 16 Why do YOU , O YOU mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously The mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? + Even Jehovah himself will reside [there] forever. + 17 The war chariots of God are in tens of thousands, thousands over and over again. + Jehovah himself has come from Siʹnai * into the holy place. + 18 You have ascended on high; + You have carried away captives; + You have taken gifts in the form of men, * + Yes, even the stubborn ones, + to reside [among them], + O Jah * God. * 19 Blessed be Jehovah, * who daily carries the load for us, + The [true] God of our salvation. + Seʹlah. 20 The [true] God is for us a God * of saving acts; + And to Jehovah the Sovereign + Lord belong the ways out * from death. + 21 Indeed God himself will break the head of his enemies in pieces, + The hairy crown of the head of anyone walking about in his guiltiness. + 22 Jehovah * has said: “From Baʹshan I shall bring back, + I shall bring [them] back from * the depths of the sea, + 23 In order that you may wash * your foot in blood, + That the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from the enemies.” + 24 They have seen your processions, O God, + The processions of my God, * my King, into the holy place. + 25 The singers went in front, the players on stringed instruments after them; + In between were the maidens beating tambourines. + 26 In congregated throngs * bless God, + Jehovah, * [O YOU who are] from the Source of Israel. + 27 There is little Benjamin subduing them, + The princes of Judah with their shouting crowd, The princes of Zebʹu·lun, the princes of Naphʹta·li. + 28 Your God has laid command upon your strength. + Do show strength, O God, you who have acted for us. + 29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, + Kings will bring gifts to you yourself. + 30 Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, + the assembly of bulls, * + With the calves of the peoples, each one stamping down on pieces of silver. + He has scattered * the peoples that take delight in fights. + 31 Bronzeware things * will come out of Egypt; + Cush * itself will quickly stretch out its hands [with gifts] to God. + 32 O YOU kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, + Make melody to Jehovah * — Seʹlah — 33 To the One riding on the ancient heaven of heavens. + Lo! He sounds with his voice, a strong voice. + 34 A SCRIBE strength to God. + Over Israel his eminence is and his strength is in the clouds. + 35 God is fear-inspiring out of your grand sanctuary. * + The God of Israel * he is, giving strength, even might to the people. + Blessed be God. + Footnotes ^ “As Jah.” BHS ftn (Heb.), ki Yah; M(Heb.), beYahʹ, “by Jah.” Yah is the first half of the Tetragrammaton, YHWH .
