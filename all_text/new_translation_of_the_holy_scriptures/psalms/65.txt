A melody of David. A song. 65 For you there is praise—silence—, O God, in Zion; + And to you the vow will be paid. + 2 O Hearer of prayer, even to you people of all flesh will come. + 3 Things of error have proved mightier than I am. + As for our transgressions, you yourself will cover them. + 4 Happy is the one you choose and cause to approach, + That he may reside in your courtyards. + We * will certainly be satisfied with the goodness of your house, + The holy place of your temple. + 5 With fear-inspiring things in righteousness you will answer us, + O God of our salvation, + The Trust of all the borders of the earth and those far away on the sea. + 6 He is firmly establishing the mountains with his power; + He is indeed girded with mightiness. + 7 He is stilling the noise of the seas, + The noise of their waves and the turmoil of the national groups. + 8 And the inhabitants of the uttermost parts will be afraid of your signs; + The goings forth of the morning and evening you cause to cry out joyfully. + 9 You have turned your attention to the earth, that you may give it abundance; + You enrich it very much. The stream from God is full of water. + You prepare their grain, + For that is the way you prepare the earth. * + 10 There is a drenching of its furrows, a leveling off of its clods; + With copious showers you soften it; you bless its very sprouts. + 11 You have crowned the year with * your goodness, + And your very tracks drip with fatness. + 12 The pasture grounds of the wilderness keep dripping, + And with joyfulness the very hills gird themselves. + 13 The pastures have become clothed with flocks, + And the low plains themselves are enveloped with grain. + They shout in triumph, yes, they sing. + Footnotes ^ “We,” M; Sy, “He.” ^ Lit., “it,” fem., referring to the “earth.” ^ Lit., “of.” Previous Next Print Share Share
