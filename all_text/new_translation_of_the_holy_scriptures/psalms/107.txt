+ For his loving-kindness * is to time indefinite. + 2 Let the reclaimed ones of Jehovah say so, + Whom he has reclaimed from the hand of the adversary, + 3 And whom he has collected together even from the lands, + From the sunrise and from the sunset, + From the north and from the south. * + 4 They wandered about in the wilderness, + in the desert; + They did not find any way to a city of habitation. + 5 They were hungry, also thirsty; + Their very soul within them began to faint away. + 6 And they kept crying out to Jehovah in their distress; + Out of the stresses upon them he proceeded to deliver them, + 7 And to have them walk in the right way, + So as to come to a city of habitation. + 8 O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness + And for his wonderful works to the sons of men. * + 9 For he has satisfied the dried-out soul; + And the hungry soul he has filled with good things. + 10 There were those dwelling in darkness and deep shadow, + Prisoners in affliction and irons. + 11 For they had behaved rebelliously + against the sayings of God; * + And the counsel of the Most High they had disrespected. + 12 So with trouble he proceeded to subdue their heart; + They stumbled, and there was no one helping. + 13 And they began calling to Jehovah for help in their distress; + Out of the stresses upon them he as usual saved them. + 14 He went bringing them out from darkness and deep shadow, + And tearing even their bands apart. + 15 O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness + And for his wonderful works to the sons of men. + 16 For he has broken the doors of copper, + And he has cut down even the bars of iron. + 17 Those who were foolish, due to the way of their transgression + And due to their errors, finally caused themselves affliction. + 18 Their soul got to detest even every sort of food, + And they were arriving at the gates of death. + 19 And they began calling to Jehovah for help in their distress; + Out of the stresses upon them he as usual saved them. + 20 He proceeded to send his word and heal them + And to provide [them] escape out of their pits. * + 21 O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness + And for his wonderful works to the sons of men. * + 22 And let them offer * the sacrifices of thanksgiving + And declare his works with a joyful cry. + 23 Those going down to the sea in the ships, + Doing business on vast * waters, + 24 They are the ones that have seen the works of Jehovah + And his wonderful works in the depths; + 25 How he says [the word] and causes a tempestuous wind * to arise, + So that it lifts up its waves. + 26 They go up to the heavens, They go down to the bottoms. * Because of the calamity their very soul finds itself melting. + 27 They reel and move unsteadily like a drunken man, + And even all their wisdom proves confused. + 28 And they begin crying out to Jehovah in their distress, + And out of the stresses upon them he brings them forth. + 29 He causes the windstorm to stand at a calm, + So that the waves of the sea * keep quiet. + 30 And they rejoice because these become still, And he leads them to the haven of their delight. + 31 O let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness + And for his wonderful works to the sons of men. * + 32 And let them extol him in the congregation * of the people; + And in the seat of the elderly men let them praise him. + 33 He converts rivers into a wilderness, + And the outflows of water into thirsty ground, + 34 Fruitful land into salt country, + Owing to the badness of those dwelling in it. 35 He converts a wilderness into a reedy pool of water, + And the land of a waterless region into outflows of water. + 36 And there he causes the hungry ones to dwell, + So that they firmly establish a city of habitation. + 37 And they sow fields and plant vineyards, + That they may yield fruitful crops. + 38 And he blesses them so that they become very many; + And he does not let their cattle become few. + 39 Again they become few and crouch down + Owing to restraint, calamity and grief. + 40 He is pouring out contempt upon nobles, + So that he makes them wander about in a featureless place, where there is no way. + 41 But he protects * the poor one from affliction + And converts him into families just like a flock. + 42 The upright ones see and rejoice; + But as for all unrighteousness, it has to shut its mouth. + 43 Who is wise? He will both observe these things + And show himself attentive toward Jehovah’s acts of loving-kindness. + Footnotes ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Lit., “the sea,” that is, the Red Sea to the south. ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “The sayings of God .” Heb., ʼim·reh- ʼElʹ . ^ Possibly, “the pit for their lives.” ^ See vs 8 ftn. ^ Lit., “sacrifice.” ^ Or, “many.” ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach .
