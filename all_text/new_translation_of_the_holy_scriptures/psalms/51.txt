A melody of David. When Nathan the prophet came in to him after he had had relations with Bath-sheʹba. + 51 Show me favor, O God, * according to your loving-kindness. * + According to the abundance of your mercies wipe out my transgressions. + 2 Thoroughly wash me from my error, + And cleanse me even from my sin. + 3 For my transgressions I myself know, + And my sin is in front of me constantly. + 4 Against you, you alone, I have sinned, + And what is bad in your eyes I have done, + In order that you may prove to be righteous when you speak, + That you may be in the clear when you judge. + 5 Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, + And in sin my mother conceived me. + 6 Look! You have taken delight in truthfulness itself in the inward parts; + And in the secret self may you cause me to know sheer wisdom. + 7 May you purify me from sin with hyssop, that I may be clean; + May you wash me, that I may become whiter even than snow. + 8 May you cause me to hear exultation and rejoicing, + That the bones that you have crushed may be joyful. + 9 Conceal your face from my sins, + And wipe out even all my errors. + 10 Create in me even a pure heart, O God, + And put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one. + 11 Do not throw me away from before your face; + And your holy spirit O do not take away from me. + 12 Do restore to me the exultation of salvation by you, + And may you support me even with a willing spirit. + 13 I will teach transgressors your ways, + That sinners themselves may turn right back to you. + 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, * + O God the God of my salvation, + That my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness. + 15 O Jehovah, * may you open these lips of mine, + That my own mouth may tell forth your praise. + 16 For you do not take delight in sacrifice—otherwise I would give [it]; + In whole burnt offering you do not find pleasure. + 17 The sacrifices to God are a broken spirit; + A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not despise. + 18 In your goodwill do deal well with Zion; + May you build the walls of Jerusalem. + 19 In that case you will be delighted with sacrifices of righteousness, + With burnt sacrifice and whole offering; + In that case bulls will be offered up on your very own altar. + Footnotes ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Lit., “bloods.” ^ One of 134 scrib­al changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
