A melody of David. 31 In you, O Jehovah, * have I taken refuge. + O may I never be ashamed. + In your righteousness provide escape for me. + 2 Incline to me your ear. + Deliver me speedily. + Become for me a rocky stronghold, + A house of strongholds to save me. + 3 For you are my crag and my stronghold; + And for the sake of your name + you will lead me and conduct me. + 4 You will bring me out of the net that they have hidden for me, + For you are my fortress. + 5 Into your hand I entrust my spirit. + You have redeemed me, + O Jehovah * the God of truth. * + 6 I do hate those paying regard to worthless, vain idols; * + But as for me, in Jehovah * I do trust. + 7 I will be joyful and rejoice in your loving-kindness, * + In that you have seen my affliction; + You have known about the distresses of my soul, + 8 And you have not surrendered me into the hand of the enemy. + You have made my feet stand in a roomy place. + 9 Show me favor, O Jehovah, * for I am in sore straits. + With vexation my eye has become weak, + my soul and my belly. + 10 For with grief my life has come to an end, + And my years in sighing. + Because of my error my power has stumbled, + And my very bones have become weak. + 11 From the standpoint of all those showing hostility to me + I have become a reproach, + And to my neighbors very much so, + And a dread to my acquaintances. + When seeing me out of doors, they have fled from me. + 12 Like someone dead [and] not in the heart, I have been forgotten; + I have become like a damaged * vessel; + 13 For I have heard the bad report by many, + Fright being on all sides. + When they mass together as one against me, + It is to take away my soul * that they do scheme. + 14 But I—in you I have put my trust, O Jehovah. + I have said: “You are my God.” * + 15 My times are in your hand. + Deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from those pursuing me. + 16 Do cause your face to shine upon your servant. + Save me in your loving-kindness. + 17 O Jehovah, may I not be ashamed, for I have called on you. + May the wicked ones be ashamed; + May they keep silent in Sheʹol. + 18 May false lips become speechless, + That are speaking against the righteous one, + unrestrainedly in haughtiness and contempt. + 19 How abundant your goodness is, + which you have treasured up for those fearing you! + [Which] you have rendered to those taking refuge in you, In front of the sons of men. * + 20 You will conceal them in the secret place of your person * + From the banding together of men. * + You will hide them in your booth from the quarreling of tongues. + 21 Blessed be Jehovah, * + For he has rendered wonderful loving-kindness + to me in a city under stress. + 22 As for me, I said when I became panicky: + “I shall certainly be exterminated from in front of your eyes.” + Surely you have heard the voice of my entreaties when I cried to you for help. + 23 O love Jehovah, * all YOU loyal ones of his. + The faithful ones Jehovah * is safeguarding, + But he is rewarding exceedingly anyone showing haughtiness. + 24 Be courageous, and may YOUR heart be strong, + All YOU who are waiting for Jehovah. * + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §10. ^ “The God of truth.” Or, “the true God.” Heb., ʼEl ʼemethʹ . ^ See App 1C §10. ^ Lit., “vanities.” ^ See App 1C §10. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ See App 1C §10. ^ Or, “missing.” ^ Or, “my life .” Heb., naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam . ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aiʹ . ^ Or, “earthling men.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “face.” Compare 2Sa 17:11 ftn, “Person.” ^ “Men.” Heb., ʼish . ^ See App 1C §10. ^ See App 1C §10. ^ See App 1C §10. ^ See App 1C §10.
