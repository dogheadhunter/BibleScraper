Masʹkil. * A song of the beloved women. 45 My heart has become astir with a goodly matter. + I am saying: “My works are concerning a king.” + May my tongue be the stylus + of a skilled copyist. + 2 You are indeed more handsome than the sons of men. * + Charm has been poured out upon your lips. + That is why God * has blessed you to time indefinite. + 3 Gird your sword + upon [your] * thigh, O mighty one, * + [With] your dignity and your splendor. + 4 And in your splendor go on to success; + Ride in the cause of truth and humility [and] righteousness, + And your right hand will instruct you in fear-inspiring things. + 5 Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling + — In the heart of the enemies of the king. + 6 God is your throne * to time indefinite, even forever; + The scepter of your kingship is a scepter of uprightness. + 7 You have loved righteousness + and you hate wickedness. + That is why God, your God, + has anointed + you * with the oil of exultation + more than your partners. + 8 All your garments are myrrh and aloeswood [and] cassia; + Out from the grand ivory + palace * stringed instruments themselves have made you rejoice. 9 The daughters + of kings are among your precious women. * The queenly consort + has taken her stand at your right hand in gold of Oʹphir. + 10 Listen, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear; And forget your people and your father’s house. + 11 And the king will long for your prettiness, + For he is your lord, * + So bow down to him. + 12 The daughter of Tyre also with a gift + — The rich ones of the people will soften your * own face. + 13 The king’s daughter is all glorious within [the house]; + Her clothing is with settings of gold. 14 In woven apparel she will be brought to the king. + The virgins in her train as her companions are being brought in to you. + 15 They will be brought with rejoicing and joyfulness; They will enter into the palace of the king. 16 In place of your * forefathers + there will come to be your sons, + Whom you will appoint as princes * in all the earth. + 17 I will make mention of your * name throughout all generations to come. + That is why peoples themselves will laud you to time indefinite, even forever.
