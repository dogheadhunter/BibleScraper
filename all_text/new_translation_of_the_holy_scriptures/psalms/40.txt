Of David, a melody. 40 I earnestly hoped in Jehovah, + And so he inclined [his ear] to me and heard my cry for help. + 2 He also proceeded to bring me up out of a roaring pit, + Out of the mire of [the] sediment. + Then he raised up my feet upon a crag; + He firmly established my steps. + 3 Further, he put in my mouth a new song, Praise to our God. + Many will see [it] and will fear, + And they will trust in Jehovah. + 4 Happy is the able-bodied man * that has put Jehovah as his trust + And that has not turned his face to defiant people, Nor to those falling away to lies. + 5 Many things you yourself have done, + O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us; + There is none to be compared to you. + Were I inclined to tell and speak [of them], They have become more numerous than I can recount. + 6 Sacrifice and offering you did not delight in; + These ears of mine you opened up. * + Burnt offering and sin offering you did not ask for. + 7 In view of that, I said: “Here I have come, + In the roll of the book it being written about me. + 8 To do your will, * O my God, I have delighted, + And your law is within my inward parts. + 9 I have told the good news * of righteousness in the big congregation. * + Look! My lips I do not restrain. + O Jehovah, you yourself know that well. + 10 Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. + Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. + I have not hidden your loving-kindness * and your trueness in * the big congregation.” + 11 You yourself, O Jehovah, do not restrain your pity from me. + Let your loving-kindness and your trueness themselves constantly safeguard me. + 12 For calamities encircled me until there was no numbering of them. + More errors of mine overtook me than I was able to see; + They became more numerous than the hairs of my head, + And my own heart left me. + 13 Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me. + O Jehovah, to my assistance do make haste. + 14 May those be ashamed and abashed all together + Who are seeking my soul to sweep it away. + May those turn back and be humiliated who are delighting in my calamity. + 15 Let those stare in amazement in consequence of their shame + Who are saying to me: “Aha! Aha!” + 16 Let those exult and rejoice in you, + All those who are seeking you. + Let those say constantly: “May Jehovah be magnified,” + Those who are loving salvation by you. + 17 But I am afflicted and poor. + Jehovah * himself takes account of me. + You are my assistance and the Provider of escape for me. + O my God, do not be too late. + Footnotes ^ “The able - bodied man .” Heb., hag ·geʹver . ^ “Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me,” LXX א ,A,B .
