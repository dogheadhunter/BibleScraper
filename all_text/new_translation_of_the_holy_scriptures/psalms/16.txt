They, even the majestic ones, are the ones in whom is all my delight.” + 4 Pains become many to those [who], when there is someone else, do hurry [after him]. + I shall not pour out their drink offerings of blood, + And I shall not carry their names upon my lips. + 5 Jehovah is the portion of my allotted share + and of my cup. * + You are holding fast my lot. 6 The measuring lines themselves have fallen for me in pleasant places. + Really, [my own] possession * has proved agreeable to me. 7 I shall bless Jehovah, who has given me advice. + Really, during the nights my kidneys * have corrected me. + 8 I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. + Because [he] is at my right hand, I shall not be made to totter. + 9 Therefore my heart does rejoice, and my glory * is inclined to be joyful. + Also, my own flesh will reside in security. + 10 For you will not leave my soul * in Sheʹol. * + You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit. * + 11 You will cause me to know the path of life. + Rejoicing to satisfaction is with your face; + There is pleasantness at your right hand forever. + Footnotes ^ Heb., mikh·tamʹ . A suggested meaning was “Psalm of expiation,” KB, p. 523. However, KB 3 , p. 552, gives the meaning “inscription.” This would indicate that the six psalms ( Ps 16, 56–60 ) with the superscription “miktam” are inscriptions of the numerous episodes described therein. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “I have said,” LXXSyVg and some Heb. mss; M, “You have said,” addressed to something fem. ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ . See App 1B . ^ “Jehovah, you have appointed my share and my cup,” by a correction of M. ^ “My own possession,” LXXSyVg. ^ Or, “my deepest emotions .” Heb., khil·yoh·th aiʹ . ^ “Tongue,” LXXVg. ^ “My soul .” Heb., naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam . See App 4A . ^ “Sheol,” MSy; Gr., haiʹden; Lat., in·ferʹno . See App 4B . ^ “Pit,” M; LXXSyVg, “corruption.” Previous Next Print Share Share
