A melody of David. 41 Happy is anyone acting with consideration toward the lowly one; + In the day of calamity Jehovah will provide escape for him. + 2 Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive. + He will be pronounced happy in the earth; + And you cannot possibly give him over to the soul * of his enemies. + 3 Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness; + All his bed you will certainly change during his sickness. + 4 As for me, I said: “O Jehovah, show me favor. + Do heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.” + 5 As for my enemies, they say what is bad concerning me: + “When will he die and his name actually perish?” 6 And if one does come to see [me], untruth is what his heart will speak; + He will gather up for himself something hurtful; He will go out; on the outside he will speak [of it]. + 7 Unitedly against me all those hating me whisper to one another; + Against me they keep scheming something bad for me: + 8 “A good-for-nothing thing * is poured out upon him; + Now that he has lain down, he will not get up again.” + 9 Also the man at peace with me, in whom I trusted, + Who was eating my bread, + has magnified [his] heel against me. * + 10 As for you, O Jehovah, show me favor and cause me to get up, + That I may pay them back. + 11 By this I do know that you have found delight in me, Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. + 12 As for me, because of my integrity you have upheld me, + And you will set me before your face to time indefinite. + 13 Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel + From time indefinite even to time indefinite. + Amen and Amen. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “to the soulful desire .” Heb., be neʹphesh ; Lat., aʹni·mam ; LXX, “in the hands.” See 35:25 ftn. ^ Lit., “A thing of belial (worthlessness).” ^ “Magnified [his] heel against me,” MLXXVg. ^ This vs is a doxology, that is, an expression of praise to Jehovah God, and corresponds with the doxology at the end of the other four books, namely, in Ps 72, 89, 106 and 150 .
