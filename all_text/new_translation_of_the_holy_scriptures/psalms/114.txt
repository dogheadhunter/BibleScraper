Ps 115–118 , which constitute the remainder of the Hallel Psalms, were sung over the fourth cup of wine. Doubtless this was done by Jesus and his disciples. See Mt 26:30 . ^ Lit., “sons of sheep; sons of the flock.” ^ “The Lord.” Heb., ʼA·dhohnʹ . ^ “God of.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . Previous Next Print Share Share
