The eye of Jehovah is toward those fearing him, + To those waiting for his loving-kindness, + 19 To deliver their soul from death itself, + And to preserve them alive in famine. + 20 Our very soul has been in expectation of Jehovah. + Our helper and our shield he is. + 21 For in him our heart rejoices; + For in his holy name we have put our trust. + 22 Let your loving-kindness, O Jehovah, prove to be upon us, + Even as we have kept waiting for you. + Footnotes ^ Or, “and by the breath .” Heb., u·ve ruʹach ; Gr., pneuʹma·ti ; Lat., spiʹri·tu .
