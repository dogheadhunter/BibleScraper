Aha! our eye has seen [it].” + 22 You have seen, O Jehovah. * + Do not keep silent. * + O Jehovah, * do not keep yourself far from me. + 23 Do arouse yourself * and awake to my judgment, + O my God, even Jehovah, * to my case at law. + 24 Judge me according to your righteousness, O Jehovah * my God, + And may they not rejoice over me. + 25 O may they not say in their heart: “Aha, our soul!” * + May they not say: “We have swallowed him up.” + 26 Let those be ashamed and abashed all together + Who are joyful at my calamity. + Let those be clothed with shame + and humiliation who are assuming great airs against me. + 27 Let those cry out joyfully and rejoice who are delighting in my righteousness, + And let them say constantly: + “Let Jehovah * be magnified, who takes delight in the peace of his servant.” + 28 And let my own tongue utter in an undertone your righteousness, + All day long your praise. + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §10. ^ “For my soul .” Heb., le naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam .
