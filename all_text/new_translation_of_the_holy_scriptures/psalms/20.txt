A melody of David. 20 May Jehovah answer you in the day of distress. + May the name of the God * of Jacob protect you. * + 2 May he send your help out of the holy place, + And sustain you out of Zion itself. + 3 May he remember all your gift offerings, + And may he accept your burnt offering as being fat. * + Seʹlah. 4 May he * give to you according to your heart, + And all your counsel may he fulfill. + 5 We will cry out joyfully because of your salvation, + And in the name of our God we shall lift our banners. * + May Jehovah fulfill all your requests. + 6 Now I do know that Jehovah certainly saves his anointed one. * + He answers him from his holy heavens + With the saving mighty acts of his right hand. + 7 Some concerning chariots and others concerning horses, + But, as for us, concerning the name of Jehovah our God we shall make mention. * + 8 Those very ones have broken down and fallen; + But as for us, we have risen up, that we may be restored. + 9 O Jehovah, do save the king! + He will answer us in the day that we call. * + Footnotes ^ “God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ Lit., “place you on high,” that is, out of reach. ^ Or, “may he clear away the fatty ashes of your burnt (consumed) offering,” as a sign of acceptance. ^ “He,” MVg; LXX A Sy and five Heb. mss, “Jehovah.” ^ “We shall be magnified,” LXXVg. ^ “His anointed one .” Heb., meshi·ch ohʹ; Gr., khri·stonʹ ; Syr., meshi·ch eh; Lat., chriʹstum . ^ “We shall be magnified,” LXX; Sy, “we shall gain strength (prevail)”; Vg, “we shall call (invoke).” ^ Or, “O Jehovah, do save [us]! Let the king himself answer us in the day that we call.” Previous Next Print Share Share
