A melody. 24 To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, + The productive land * and those dwelling in it. + 2 For upon the seas he himself has solidly fixed it, + And upon the rivers * he keeps it firmly established. + 3 Who may ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, + And who may rise up in his holy place? + 4 Anyone innocent in his hands and clean in heart, + Who has not carried My * soul * to sheer worthlessness, + Nor taken an oath deceitfully. + 5 He will carry away blessing from Jehovah + And righteousness from his God of salvation. + 6 This is the generation of those seeking him, Of those searching for your face, O [God of] Jacob. * + Seʹlah. 7 Raise YOUR heads, O YOU gates, + And raise yourselves up, O YOU long-lasting * entrances, + That the glorious King may come in! + 8 Who, then, is this glorious King? + Jehovah strong and mighty, + Jehovah mighty in battle. * + 9 Raise YOUR heads, O YOU gates; + Yes, raise [them] up, O YOU long-lasting entrances, That the glorious King may come in! + 10 Who, then, is he, this glorious King? Jehovah of armies * —he is the glorious King. + Seʹlah.
