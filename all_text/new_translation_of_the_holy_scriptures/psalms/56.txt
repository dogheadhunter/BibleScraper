Mikʹtam. * When the Phi·lisʹtines laid hold of him in Gath. + 56 Show me favor, O God, because mortal man has snapped at me. + Warring all day long, he keeps oppressing me. + 2 My foes have kept snapping all day long, + For there are many warring against me high-mindedly. + 3 Whatever day I get afraid, I, for my part, shall trust even in you. + 4 In union with God I shall praise his word. + In God I have put my trust; I shall not be afraid. + What can flesh do to me? + 5 All day long they keep hurting my personal affairs; All their thoughts are against me for bad. + 6 They attack, they conceal themselves, + They, for their part, keep observing my very steps, * + While they have waited for my soul. + 7 On account of [their] hurtfulness cast them forth. + In anger bring down even the peoples, O God. + 8 My being a fugitive you yourself have reported. + Do put my tears in your skin bottle. + Are they not in your book? + 9 At that time my enemies will turn back, on the day that I call; + This I well know, that God is for me. + 10 In union with God + I shall praise [his] word; In union with Jehovah I shall praise [his] word. + 11 In God I have put my trust. I shall not be afraid. + What can earthling man * do to me? + 12 Upon me, O God, there are vows to you. + I shall render expressions of thanksgiving to you. + 13 For you have delivered my soul * from death + — [Have you] not [delivered] my feet from stumbling? + — That [I] may walk about before God * in the light * of those alive. + Footnotes ^ Possibly, “Dove of Silence, those far away.” By a slight correction, “Dove of the big trees far away.” ^ See 16:Sup ftn. ^ Lit., “heels.” ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “My soul .” Heb., naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam .
