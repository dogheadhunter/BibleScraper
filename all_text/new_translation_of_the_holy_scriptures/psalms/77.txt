Seʹlah. 16 The waters have seen you, O God, The waters have seen you; they began to be in severe pains. + Also, the watery deeps * began to be agitated. + 17 The clouds have thunderously poured down water; + A sound the cloudy skies have given forth. Also, your own arrows proceeded to go here and there. + 18 The sound of your thunder was like chariot wheels; + Lightnings have lighted up the productive land; * + The earth became agitated and began to rock. + 19 Through the sea your way was, + And your path was through many waters; And your very footprints have not come to be known. 20 You have led your people just like a flock, + By the hand of Moses and Aaron. + Footnotes ^ See 39:Sup ftn. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; TLXXVg, “Jehovah.” ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
