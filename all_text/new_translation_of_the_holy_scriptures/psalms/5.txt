It may be the name of a musical wind instrument or the designation of a melody. LXXVg, “her who inherits.” ^ Or, “nothing bad.” ^ Lit., “A man of bloods .” Heb., ʼish- da·mimʹ , pl. ^ “Your holy temple .” Heb., heh·khal-qodh·sh ekhaʹ; Gr., na·onʹ haʹgi·onʹ ; Lat., temʹplum sancʹtum . Compare 2Ki 20:18 ftn. See Mt 23:16 ftn. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Their,” LXXSyVg; M, “his.” ^ Lit., “they make their tongue smooth.” ^ “Let there be a dispersing.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive construct, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ “To time indefinite .” Heb., le ʽoh·lamʹ .
