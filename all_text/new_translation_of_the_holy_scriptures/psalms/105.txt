+ He broke every rod around which ring-shaped loaves were suspended. * + 17 He sent ahead of them a man * Who was sold to be a slave, Joseph. + 18 With fetters they afflicted his feet, + Into irons his soul came; + 19 Until the time that his word * came, + The saying * of Jehovah itself refined him. + 20 The king sent that he might release him, + The ruler of the peoples, that he might let him loose. 21 He set him as master to his household + And as ruler over all his property, + 22 To bind his princes agreeably to his soul * + And that he might teach wisdom to even his elderly men. + 23 And Israel proceeded to come into Egypt, + And Jacob himself resided as an alien in the land of Ham. + 24 And he kept making his people very fruitful, + And gradually made them mightier than their adversaries. + 25 He let their heart change to hate his people, + To behave cunningly against his servants. + 26 He sent Moses his servant, + Aaron whom he had chosen. + 27 They * set among them the matters of his signs, + And the miracles in the land of Ham. + 28 He sent darkness and so made it dark; + And they did not rebel against his words. + 29 He changed their waters into blood, + And proceeded to put their fish to death. + 30 Their land swarmed with frogs, + In the interior rooms of their kings. 31 He said that the gadflies should come in, + Gnats in all their territories. + 32 He made their downpours hail, + A flaming fire on their land. + 33 And he proceeded to strike their vines and their fig trees And to break the trees of their territory. + 34 He said that the locusts should come in, + And a species of locust, * even without number. + 35 And they went eating all the vegetation in their land; + They also went eating the fruitage of their ground. 36 And he proceeded to strike down every firstborn in their land, + The beginning of all their generative power. + 37 And he began to bring them out with silver and gold; + And among his tribes there was no one stumbling along. 38 Egypt rejoiced when they went out, For the dread of them had fallen upon them. + 39 He spread out a cloud for a screen, + And fire to give light by night. + 40 They * asked, and he proceeded to bring quails, + And with bread from heaven he kept satisfying them. + 41 He opened a rock, and waters began to flow out; + These went through the waterless regions as a river. + 42 For he remembered his holy word * with Abraham his servant. + 43 So he brought out his people with exultation, + His chosen ones even with a joyful cry. + 44 And gradually he gave them the lands of the nations, + And they kept taking possession of the product of the hard work of national groups, + 45 To the end that they might keep his regulations + And observe his own laws. + Praise Jah, YOU people! + Footnotes ^ Lit., “cut.” ^ “Which [statement].” Heb., ha, a pronominal suffix to the fem. verb, referring to the fem. expression “sworn statement” in vs 9. ^ “They,” MLXXVg;
