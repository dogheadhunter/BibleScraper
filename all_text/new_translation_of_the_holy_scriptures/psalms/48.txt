A melody of the sons of Koʹrah. + 48 Jehovah is great and much to be praised + In the city of our God, + [in] his holy mountain. + 2 Pretty for loftiness, the exultation of the whole earth, + Is Mount Zion on the remote sides of the north, + The town of the grand King. + 3 In her dwelling towers God himself has become known as a secure height. + 4 For, look! the kings themselves have met by appointment, + They have passed by together. + 5 They themselves saw; [and] so they were amazed. They got disturbed, they were sent running in panic. + 6 Trembling itself took hold of them there, + Birth pangs like those of a woman giving birth. + 7 With an east wind you wreck the ships of Tarʹshish. + 8 Just as we have heard, so we have seen + In the city of Jehovah of armies, in the city of our God. + God himself will firmly establish it * to time indefinite. + Seʹlah. 9 We have pondered, O God, over your loving-kindness + In the midst of your temple. + 10 Like your name, + O God, so your praise is To the borders of the earth. Your right hand is full of righteousness itself. + 11 May Mount Zion + rejoice, May the dependent towns * of Judah be joyful, + on account of your judicial decisions. + 12 March around Zion, YOU people, and go about it, + Count its towers. + 13 Set YOUR hearts upon its rampart. + Inspect * its dwelling towers, In order that YOU may recount it to the future generation. + 14 For this God is our God to time indefinite, even forever. + He himself will guide us until [we] die. * + Footnotes ^ “It,” fem., referring to the “city.” ^ Lit., “the daughters.” Compare Nu 21:25 ftn. ^ “Inspect,” by a correction; Heb., pas·seghuʹ, the meaning of which is uncertain; LXXVg, “Distribute.” ^ “Until [we] die,” MSy; LXXVg, “forever.” Previous Next Print Share Share
