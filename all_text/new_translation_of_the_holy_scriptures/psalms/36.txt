Of Jehovah’s * servant, David. 36 The utterance of transgression to the wicked one is in the midst of his * heart; + There is no dread of God in front of his eyes. + 2 For he has acted too smoothly to himself in his own eyes + To find out his error so as to hate [it]. + 3 The words of his mouth are hurtfulness and deception; + He has ceased to have insight for doing good. + 4 Hurtfulness is what he keeps scheming upon his bed. + He stations himself on a way that is not good. + What is bad he does not reject. + 5 O Jehovah, * your loving-kindness * is in the heavens; + Your faithfulness is up to the clouds. + 6 Your righteousness is like mountains of God; * + Your judicial decision is a vast watery deep. * + Man * and beast you save, O Jehovah. + 7 How precious your loving-kindness is, O God! * + And in the shadow of your wings the sons of men themselves take refuge. + 8 They drink their fill of the fatness of your house; + And of the torrent of your pleasures you cause them to drink. + 9 For with you is the source * of life; + By light from you we can see light. + 10 Continue your loving-kindness to those knowing you, + And your righteousness to those upright in heart. + 11 O may not the foot of haughtiness come [against] me; + As for the hand of wicked people, let it not make me a wanderer. + 12 There the practicers of hurtfulness have fallen; + They have been pushed down and have been unable to get up. + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §10. ^ “His,” LXXSyVg and a few Heb. mss; MT, “my.” ^ See App 1C §10. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Or, “Mankind.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “vast body of surging waters .” Heb., tehohmʹ rab·bahʹ .
