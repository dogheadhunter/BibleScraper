Hear my saying. + 7 Make your acts of loving-kindnesses * wonderful, + O Savior of those seeking refuge From the revolters against your right hand. + 8 Keep me as the pupil of the eyeball, + In the shadow of your wings may you conceal me, + 9 Because of the wicked who have despoiled me. The enemies against my soul themselves keep closing in upon me. + 10 They have enclosed [themselves] with their own fat; + With their mouth they have spoken in haughtiness; + 11 As regards our steps, now they have surrounded us; + They fix their eyes to incline to the earth. + 12 His likeness is that of a lion that yearns to tear to pieces + And that of a young lion sitting in concealed places. 13 Do rise up, O Jehovah; do confront him to the face; + Make him bow down; do provide escape for my soul from the wicked one with your sword, + 14 From men, [by] your hand, O Jehovah, + From men of [this] system + of things, * whose share is in [this] life, + And whose belly you fill with your concealed treasure, + Who are satisfied with sons + And who do lay up for their children what they leave over. + 15 As for me, in righteousness I shall behold your face; + I will be satisfied when awakening [to see] your form. * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “Let there be a taking hold by my steps.” The Heb. verb in this phrase is in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Lit., “your loving-kindnesses.” ^ “Of [this] system of things .” Or, “of the duration of life .” Heb., me· cheʹledh . ^ Or, “awakening as to your form,” M; by a correction, “looking at your form”; LXX, “your glory is seen.” Previous Next Print Share Share
