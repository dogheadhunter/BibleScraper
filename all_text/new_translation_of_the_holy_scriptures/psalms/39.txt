I spoke with my tongue: 4 “Cause me, O Jehovah, to know my end, + And the measure of my days—what it is, + That I may know how transient I am. + 5 Look! You have made my days just a few; * + And my life’s duration is as nothing in front of you. + Surely every earthling man, * though standing firm, is nothing but an exhalation. + Seʹlah. 6 Surely in a semblance man * walks about. + Surely they are boisterous in vain. + One piles up things and does not know who will be gathering them. + 7 And now for what have I hoped, O Jehovah? * My expectation is toward you. + 8 From all my transgressions deliver me. + Do not set me as a reproach of the senseless one. + 9 I kept speechless; + I could not open my mouth, + For you yourself acted. + 10 Remove from off me your plague. + Due to the hostility of your hand I myself have come to an end. + 11 By reproofs against error you have corrected man, * + And you consume his desirable things just as a moth + does. Surely every earthling man * is an exhalation. + Seʹlah. 12 Do hear my prayer, O Jehovah, And to my cry for help do give ear. + At my tears do not keep silent. + For I am but an alien resident with you, + A settler the same as all my forefathers. + 13 Look away from me, that I may brighten up + Before I go away and I am not.” + Footnotes ^ “Jeduthun.” An unexplained term. ^ Lit., “just handbreadths.” ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
