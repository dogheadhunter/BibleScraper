A melody of Aʹsaph. + 83 O God, let there be no silence on your part; + Do not keep speechless, and do not stay quiet, O Divine One. * + 2 For, look! your very enemies are in an uproar; + And the very ones intensely hating you have raised [their] head. + 3 Against your people they cunningly carry on their confidential talk; + And they conspire against your concealed ones. + 4 They have said: “Come and let us efface them from being a nation, + That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” + 5 For with the heart they have unitedly exchanged counsel; + Against you they proceeded to conclude even a covenant, * + 6 The tents of Eʹdom + and the Ishʹma·el·ites, Moʹab + and the Hagʹrites, + 7 Geʹbal and Amʹmon + and Amʹa·lek, Phi·lisʹti·a + together with the inhabitants of Tyre. + 8 Also, As·syrʹi·a * itself has become joined with them; + They have become an arm to the sons of Lot. * + Seʹlah. 9 Do to them as to Midʹi·an, + as to Sisʹe·ra, + As to Jaʹbin + at the torrent valley of Kiʹshon. + 10 They were annihilated at En-dor; + They became manure for the ground. + 11 As for their nobles, make these like Oʹreb and like Zeʹeb, + And like Zeʹbah and like Zal·munʹna all their dukes, + 12 Who have said: “Let us take possession of the abiding places of God for ourselves.” + 13 O my God, make them like a thistle whirl, + Like stubble before a wind. * + 14 Like a fire that burns up the forest + And like a flame that scorches the mountains, + 15 In just that way may you pursue them with your tempest + And may you disturb them with your own storm wind. + 16 Fill their faces with dishonor, + That people * may search for your name, O Jehovah. + 17 O may they be ashamed and be disturbed for all times, + And may they become abashed and perish; + 18 That people may know + that you, whose name is Jehovah, + You alone are the Most High + over all the earth. + Footnotes ^ Or, “O God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “Covenant.” Heb., berithʹ; Gr., di·a·theʹken; Vg(Lat.), te·sta·menʹtum .
