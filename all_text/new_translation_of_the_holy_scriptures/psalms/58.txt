Mikʹtam. * 58 [In YOUR ] silence can YOU really speak about righteousness itself? + Can YOU judge in uprightness itself, O YOU sons of men? * + 2 How much, rather, do YOU with the heart practice outright unrighteousness in the earth, + [And] prepare the road for the very violence of YOUR hands! + 3 The wicked ones have been perverts from the womb; + They have wandered about from the belly onward; They are speaking lies. + 4 The venom of theirs is like the venom of the serpent, + Deaf like the cobra that stops up its ear, + 5 That will not listen to the voice of charmers, + Though someone wise is binding with spells. * + 6 O God, knock out their teeth in their mouth. + Break down the very jawbones of maned young lions, O Jehovah. 7 May they dissolve as into waters that go their way; + May he bend [the bow for] his arrows as they collapse. + 8 Like a snail melting away he walks; * Like a miscarriage of a woman they will certainly not behold the sun. + 9 Before YOUR pots feel the [kindled] bramble, + The live green as well as the burning, he will carry them off as a stormy wind. + 10 The righteous one will rejoice because he has beheld the vengeance. + His steps he will bathe in the blood of the wicked one. + 11 And mankind will say: + “Surely there is fruitage for the righteous one. + Surely there exists a God that is judging * in the earth.” + Footnotes ^ See 16:Sup ftn. ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ See App 7A regarding cobras responding to sound. ^ Or, “leaving a slimy track.” ^ “That is judging.” Heb., sho·phetimʹ, pl. to agree with ʼElo·himʹ, “God,” which is pl. to denote excellence and grandeur; LXXSyVg make the participle sing., “that is judging them.” Previous Next Print Share Share
