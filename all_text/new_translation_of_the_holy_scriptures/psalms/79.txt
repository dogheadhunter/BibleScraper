Forever? + How long will your ardor burn just like fire? + 6 Pour out your rage upon the nations that have not known you, + And upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your own name. + 7 For they have eaten up Jacob, + And they have caused his own abiding place to be desolated. + 8 Do not remember against us the errors of ancestors. + Hurry! Let your mercies confront us, + For we have become greatly impoverished. + 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, + For the sake of the glory of your name; + And deliver us and cover over our sins on account of your name. + 10 Why should the nations say: “Where is their God?” + Among the nations let there be known before our eyes + The avenging of the blood of your servants that has been shed. + 11 May the sighing of the prisoner come in even before you. + According to the greatness of your arm preserve * those appointed to death. * + 12 And repay to our neighbors seven times into their bosom + Their reproach with which they have reproached you, O Jehovah. * + 13 As for us your people and the flock of your pasturage, + We shall give thanks to you to time indefinite; From generation to generation we shall declare your praise. + Footnotes ^ Or, “leave over.” Sy, “set free.” ^ Lit., “the sons of death.” ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
