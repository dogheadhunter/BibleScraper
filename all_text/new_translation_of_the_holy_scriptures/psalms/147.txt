Praise your God, O Zion. + 13 For he has made the bars of your gates strong; He has blessed your sons in the midst of you. + 14 He is putting peace in your territory; + With the fat * of the wheat he keeps satisfying you. + 15 He is sending his saying to the earth; + With speed his word runs. + 16 He is giving snow like wool; + Hoarfrost he scatters just like ashes. + 17 He is throwing his ice like morsels. + Before his cold who can stand? + 18 He sends forth his word + and melts them. He causes his wind * to blow; + The waters trickle. 19 He is telling his word to Jacob, + His regulations + and his judicial decisions to Israel. + 20 He has not done that way to any other nation; + And as for [his] judicial decisions, they have not known them. * + Praise Jah, YOU people! + Footnotes ^ See 104:35 ftns. ^ “Our Lord .” Heb., ʼAdhoh·n ehʹnu, pl. of ʼA·dhohnʹ, to denote excellence, and with sing. adjectives, “great” and “abundant.” ^ Lit., “sons of the raven.” ^ “The man .” Heb., ha ·ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “the best part.” ^ “His wind .” Heb., ru·ch ohʹ; Gr., pneuʹma ; Lat., spiʹri·tus .
