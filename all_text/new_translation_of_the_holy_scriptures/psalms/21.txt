A melody of David. 21 O Jehovah, in your strength the king rejoices; + And in your salvation how very joyful he wants to be! + 2 The desire of his heart you have given him, + And the wish of his lips you have not withheld. + Seʹlah. 3 For you proceeded to meet him with blessings of good, + [And] to place on his head a crown of refined gold. + 4 Life he asked of you. You gave [it] to him, + Length of days to time indefinite, even forever. + 5 His glory is great in your salvation. + Dignity and splendor you put upon him. + 6 For you constitute him highly blessed forever; + You make him feel glad with the rejoicing at your face. + 7 For the king is trusting in Jehovah, + Even in the loving-kindness * of the Most High. He will not be caused to totter. + 8 Your hand will find all your enemies; + Your own right hand will find those hating you. 9 You will constitute them as a fiery furnace at the appointed time for your attention. + Jehovah in his anger will swallow them up, and the fire will devour them. + 10 Their fruitage you will destroy from the very earth, + And their offspring * from the sons of men. * + 11 For they have directed against you what is bad; + They have thought out ideas that they are unable to carry out. + 12 For you will make them turn their backs in flight + By your bowstrings that you make ready against their face. + 13 O be exalted in your strength, O Jehovah. + We will sing and make melody to your mightiness. + Footnotes ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Or, “seed.” ^ Lit., “earthling man,” used collectively.
