These are the wicked, who are at ease indefinitely. + They have increased [their] means of maintenance. + 13 Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my heart + And that I wash my hands in innocence itself. + 14 And I came to be plagued all day long, + And my correction is every morning. + 15 If I had said: “I will tell a story like that,” Look! against the generation of your sons I should have acted treacherously. + 16 And I kept considering so as to know this; + It was a trouble in my eyes, 17 Until I proceeded to come into the grand sanctuary of God. + I wanted to discern their future. + 18 Surely on slippery ground is where you place them. + You have made them fall to ruins. + 19 O how they have become an object of astonishment as in a moment! + [How] they have reached their end, have been brought to their finish through sudden terrors! 20 Like a dream after awaking, O Jehovah, * + [So] when arousing [yourself] you will despise their very image. + 21 For my heart was soured + And in my kidneys I was sharply pained, + 22 And I was unreasoning and I could not know; + I became as mere beasts from your standpoint. + 23 But I am constantly with you; + You have taken hold of my right hand. + 24 With your counsel you will lead me, + And afterward you will take me even to glory. + 25 Whom do I have in the heavens? + And besides you I do have no other delight on the earth. + 26 My organism and my heart have failed. + God is the rock of my heart and my share to time indefinite. + 27 For, look! the very ones keeping away from you will perish. + You will certainly silence every one immorally leaving you. + 28 But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. + In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, + To declare all your works. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “been poured out.” ^ “Mortal man.” Heb., ʼenohshʹ . ^ “Other men.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
