Of Aʹsaph. + A song. 75 We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks to you, + And your name is near. + Men have to declare your wondrous works. + 2 “For I proceeded to take a set time; + I myself began judging with uprightness. + 3 The earth and all its inhabitants being dissolved, + It was I that adjusted its pillars.” + Seʹlah. 4 I said to the foolish ones: “Do not be foolish,” + And to the wicked ones: “Do not exalt the horn. + 5 Do not exalt YOUR horn on high. Do not speak with an arrogant neck. + 6 For neither from the east * nor from the west, Nor from the south * is there an exalting. 7 For God is the judge. + This one he abases, and that one he exalts. + 8 For there is a cup in the hand of Jehovah, + And the wine is foaming, it is full of mixture. And he will surely pour out its dregs from it; All the wicked ones of the earth will drain [them] out, drink [them].” + 9 But as for me, I shall tell [of it] to time indefinite; I will make melody to the God of Jacob. + 10 And all the horns of the wicked ones I shall cut down. + The horns of the righteous one will be exalted. + Footnotes ^ Compare the superscriptions of Ps 57–59 . ^ Lit., “from a going forth,” that is, of the sun. ^ Lit., “wilderness,” that is, to the south.
