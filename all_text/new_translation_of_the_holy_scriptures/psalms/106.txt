+ For his loving-kindness * is to time indefinite. + 2 Who can utter the mighty performances of Jehovah, + [Or] can make all his praise to be heard? + 3 Happy are those observing justice, + Doing * righteousness all the time. + 4 Remember me, O Jehovah, with the goodwill toward your people. + Take care of me with your salvation, + 5 That I may see the goodness to your chosen ones, + That I may rejoice with the rejoicing of your nation, + That I may make my boast with your inheritance. + 6 We have sinned just the same as our forefathers; + We have done wrong; we have acted wickedly. + 7 As for our forefathers in Egypt, They did not show any insight into your wonderful works. + They did not remember the abundance of your grand loving-kindness, + But they behaved rebelliously at the sea, by the Red Sea. + 8 And he proceeded to save them for the sake of his name, + So as to make his mightiness known. + 9 Accordingly he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was gradually dried up; + And he went walking them through the watery deep * as through the wilderness; + 10 And so he saved them from the hand of the hater + And reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy. + 11 And the waters came covering their adversaries; + Not one of them was left. + 12 Then they had faith in his word; + They began to sing his praise. + 13 Quickly they forgot his works; + They did not wait for his counsel. + 14 But they showed their selfish desire in the wilderness + And went putting God * to the proof in the desert. + 15 And he proceeded to give them their request + And to send a wasting disease * into their soul. + 16 And they began to envy Moses in the camp, + Even Aaron the holy one of Jehovah. + 17 The earth then opened up and swallowed down Daʹthan, + And covered over the assembly of A·biʹram. + 18 And a fire went burning among their assembly; + A flame itself went devouring the wicked ones. + 19 Furthermore, they made a calf in Hoʹreb + And bowed down to a molten image, + 20 So that they exchanged my glory * + For a representation of a bull, an eater of vegetation. + 21 They forgot God their Savior, * + The Doer of great things in Egypt, + 22 Wonderful works in the land of Ham, + Fear-inspiring things at the Red Sea. + 23 And he was about to say to annihilate them, + If it had not been for Moses his chosen one, Who stood in the gap before him, + To turn back his rage from bringing [them] to ruin. + 24 And they got to contemning the desirable land; + They had no faith in his word. + 25 And they kept grumbling in their tents; + They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah. + 26 So he proceeded to raise his hand [in an oath] concerning them, + That he would make them fall in the wilderness, + 27 And that he would make their offspring fall among the nations, + And that he would scatter them among the lands. + 28 And they began to attach themselves to Baʹal of Peʹor + And to eat the sacrifices of the dead ones. + 29 As they were causing offense by their dealings, + A scourge now broke out among them. + 30 When Phinʹe·has stood up and intervened, + Then the scourge was halted. 31 And it came to be counted to him as righteousness For generation after generation to time indefinite. + 32 Further, they caused provocation at the waters of Merʹi·bah, + So that it went badly with Moses by reason of them. + 33 For they embittered his spirit * And he began to speak rashly with his lips. + 34 They did not annihilate the peoples, + As Jehovah had said to them. + 35 And they went mingling with the nations + And took up learning their works. + 36 And they kept serving * their idols, + And these came to be a snare to them. + 37 And they would sacrifice their sons + And their daughters to demons. * + 38 So they kept spilling innocent blood, + The blood of their sons and their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Caʹnaan; + And the land came to be polluted with bloodshed. * + 39 And they got to be unclean by their works + And kept having immoral intercourse by their dealings. + 40 And the anger of Jehovah began to blaze against his people, + And he came to detest his inheritance. + 41 And he repeatedly gave them into the hand of the nations, + That those hating them might rule over them, + 42 And that their enemies might oppress them, And that they might be subdued under their hand. + 43 Many times he would deliver them, + But they themselves would behave rebelliously in their disobedient course, + And they would be brought low for their error. + 44 And he * would see the distress of theirs + When he heard their entreating cry. + 45 And he would remember concerning them his covenant, + And he would feel regret according to the abundance of his grand loving-kindness. + 46 And he would grant them to be objects of pity Before all those holding them captive. + 47 Save us, O Jehovah our God, + And collect us together from the nations + To give thanks to your holy name, + To speak exultingly in your praise. + 48 Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel + From time indefinite even to time indefinite; And all the people must say * Amen. + Praise Jah, YOU people! * + Footnotes ^ See 104:35 ftns. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Doing,” pl., TLXXSyVg; M, “anyone doing.” ^ Or, “through the surging waters .” Heb., bat· teho·mohthʹ , pl. of tehohmʹ;
