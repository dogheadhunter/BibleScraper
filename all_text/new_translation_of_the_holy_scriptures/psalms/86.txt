Answer me, + For I am afflicted and poor. + 2 O do guard my soul, for I am loyal. + Save your servant—you are my God—that is trusting in you. + 3 Show me favor, O Jehovah, * + For to you I keep calling all day long. + 4 Make the soul of your servant rejoice, + For to you, O Jehovah, * I lift up my very soul. + 5 For you, O Jehovah, * are good + and ready to forgive; + And the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant. + 6 Do give ear, O Jehovah, to my prayer; + And do pay attention to the voice of my entreaties. + 7 In the day of my distress I will call upon you, + For you will answer me. + 8 There is none like you among the gods, * O Jehovah, * + Neither are there any works like yours. + 9 All the nations whom you have made will themselves come, + And they will bow down before you, O Jehovah, * + And will give glory to your name. + 10 For you are great and are doing wondrous things; + You are God, you alone. + 11 Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. + I shall walk in your truth. + Unify my heart to fear your name. + 12 I laud you, O Jehovah * my God, with all my heart, + And I will glorify your name to time indefinite, 13 For your loving-kindness is great toward me, + And you have delivered my soul out of Sheʹol, its lowest place. + 14 O God, the presumptuous ones themselves have risen up against me; + And the very assembly of tyrannical ones have looked for my soul, + And they have not set you in front of themselves. + 15 But you, O Jehovah, * are a God * merciful and gracious, + Slow to anger + and abundant in loving-kindness and trueness. * + 16 Turn to me and show me favor. + Do give your strength to your servant, + And do save the son of your slave girl. + 17 Work out with me a sign meaning goodness, That those hating me may see [it] and be ashamed. + For you yourself, O Jehovah, have helped me and comforted me. + Footnotes ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
