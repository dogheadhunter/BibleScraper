A melody of David. 140 Rescue me, O Jehovah, from bad men; * + May you safeguard me even from the man of deeds of violence, + 2 Those who have schemed bad things in [their] heart, + Who all day long keep attacking as in wars. + 3 They have sharpened their tongue like that of a serpent; + The venom of the horned viper is under their lips. + Seʹlah. 4 Keep me, O Jehovah, from the hands of the wicked one; + May you safeguard me even from the man * of deeds of violence, + Those who have schemed to push my steps. + 5 The self-exalted ones have hidden a trap for me; + And ropes they have spread out as a net at the side of the track. + Snares they have set for me. + Seʹlah. 6 I have said to Jehovah: * “You are my God. * + Do give ear, O Jehovah, to the voice of my entreaties.” + 7 O Jehovah the Sovereign Lord, + the strength of my salvation, + You have screened over my head in the day of the armed force. + 8 Do not grant, O Jehovah, the cravings of the wicked one. + Do not promote his plotting, that they may not be exalted. + Seʹlah. 9 As for the heads of those surrounding me, + May the trouble of their own lips cover them. + 10 May burning coals be dropped upon them. + Let them be made to fall into the fire, + into watery pits, that they may not get up. + 11 The big talker * —let him not be firmly established in the earth. + The man of violence—let evil itself hunt him with repeated thrusts. + 12 I well know that Jehovah will execute + The legal claim of the afflicted one, the judgment of the poor ones. + 13 Surely the righteous themselves will give thanks to your name; + The upright ones will dwell before your face. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “from . . . earthling man .” Heb., me· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “From the man of.” Heb., me· ʼishʹ . ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼEʹl i . ^ “To Jehovah.” Heb., la·Yhwahʹ . ^ Or, “The slanderer.” Lit., “The man of tongue.” Previous Next Print Share Share
