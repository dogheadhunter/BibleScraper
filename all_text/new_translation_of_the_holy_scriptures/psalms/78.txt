He struck a rock + That waters might flow and torrents themselves might flood forth. + “Is he able also to give bread itself, + Or can he prepare sustenance for his people?” + 21 That was why Jehovah heard and began to be furious; + And fire itself was kindled against Jacob, + And anger also ascended against Israel. + 22 For they did not put faith in God, + And they did not trust in salvation by him. + 23 And he proceeded to command the cloudy skies above, And he opened the very doors of heaven. + 24 And he kept raining upon them manna to eat, + And the grain of heaven he gave to them. + 25 Men * ate the very bread of powerful ones; * + Provisions he sent them to satisfaction. + 26 He began making an east wind burst forth in the heavens + And making a south wind blow by his own strength. + 27 And he proceeded to make sustenance rain upon them just like dust, + Even winged flying creatures just like the sand grains of the seas. + 28 And he kept making [them] fall in the middle of his camp, + All around his tabernacles. + 29 And they went eating and satisfying themselves very much, + And what they desired he proceeded to bring to them. + 30 They had not turned aside from their desire, While their food was yet in their mouth, + 31 When God’s wrath itself ascended against them. + And he went killing among their stout ones; + And the young men of Israel he made collapse. 32 Despite all this they sinned some more + And did not put faith in his wonderful works. + 33 So he brought their days to an end as if a mere exhalation, + And their years by the disturbance. 34 As often as he killed them, they also inquired for him, + And they returned and looked for God. * + 35 And they began to remember that God * was their Rock, + And that God the Most High was their Avenger. + 36 And they tried to fool him with their mouth; + And with their tongue they tried to lie to him. + 37 And their heart was not steadfast with him; + And they did not prove faithful in his covenant. + 38 But he was merciful; + he would cover the error + and not bring ruin. + And many times he made his anger turn back, + And he would not rouse up all his rage. 39 And he kept remembering that they were flesh, + That the spirit * is going forth and does not come back. + 40 How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness, + They would make him feel hurt in the desert! + 41 And again and again they would put God * to the test, + And they pained even the Holy One of Israel. + 42 They did not remember his hand, + The day that he redeemed them from the adversary, + 43 How he put his signs in Egypt itself + And his miracles in the field of Zoʹan; + 44 And how he began changing to blood their Nile canals, + So that they could not drink from their own streams. + 45 He proceeded to send upon them gadflies, that these might eat them up; + And frogs, that these might bring them to ruin. + 46 And he began to give to the cockroaches their yield, And their toil to the locusts. + 47 He went killing their vine even by the hail + And their sycamore trees by hailstones. + 48 And he proceeded to hand over their beasts of burden even to the hail + And their livestock to the flaming fever. 49 He went sending upon them his burning anger, + Fury and denunciation and distress, + Deputations of angels bringing calamity. + 50 He proceeded to prepare a pathway for his anger. + He did not hold back their soul from death itself; And their life he handed over even to the pestilence. * + 51 Finally he struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, + The beginning of their generative power * in the tents of Ham. + 52 Afterward he caused his people to depart just like a flock, + And conducted them like a drove in the wilderness. + 53 And he kept leading them in security, and they felt no dread; + And the sea covered their enemies themselves. + 54 And he proceeded to bring them to his holy territory, + This mountainous region that his right hand acquired. + 55 And because of them he gradually drove out the nations, + And by the measuring line he went allotting them an inheritance, + So that he caused the tribes of Israel to reside in their own homes. * + 56 And they began to test and rebel against God the Most High, + And his reminders they did not keep. + 57 They also kept turning back and acting treacherously like their forefathers; + They turned around like a loose bow. + 58 And they kept offending him with their high places, + And with their graven images they kept inciting him to jealousy. + 59 God heard + and got to be furious, + And so he contemned Israel very much. + 60 And he finally forsook the tabernacle of Shiʹloh, + The tent in which he resided among earthling men. + 61 And he proceeded to give his strength even to captivity + And his beauty into the hand of the adversary. + 62 And he kept handing over his people to the sword itself, + And against his inheritance he became furious. + 63 His young men a fire ate up, And his virgins were not praised. * + 64 As for his priests, they fell by the very sword, + And their * own widows did not give way to weeping. + 65 Then Jehovah * began to awake as from sleeping, + Like a mighty one sobering up from wine. + 66 And he went striking down his adversaries from behind; + A reproach of indefinite duration he gave to them. + 67 And he proceeded to reject the tent of Joseph; + And the tribe of Eʹphra·im he did not choose. + 68 But he chose the tribe of Judah, + Mount Zion, which he loved. + 69 And he began to build his sanctuary just like the heights, + Like the earth that he has founded to time indefinite. + 70 And so he chose David his servant + And took him from the pens of the flock. + 71 From following the females giving suck + He brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people + And over Israel his inheritance. + 72 And he began to shepherd them according to the integrity of his heart, + And with the skillfulness of his hands he began leading them. + Footnotes ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ “In God.” Heb., vEʼ·lo·himʹ . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “just like surging waters .” Heb., ki th·ho·mohthʹ .
