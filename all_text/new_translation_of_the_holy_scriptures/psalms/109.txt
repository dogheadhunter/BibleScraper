Of David. A melody. 109 O God of my praise, + do not keep silent. + 2 For the mouth of the wicked one and the mouth of deception have opened against me. + They have spoken about me with the tongue of falsehood; + 3 And with words of hatred they have surrounded me, + And they keep fighting against me without cause. + 4 For my love they keep resisting me; + But on my part there is prayer. + 5 And they render to me bad for good + And hatred for my love. + 6 Appoint over him someone wicked, And may a resister * + himself keep standing at his right hand. 7 When he is judged, let him go forth as someone wicked; And let his very prayer become a sin. + 8 Let his days prove to be few; + His office of oversight * let someone else take. + 9 Let his sons become fatherless boys + And his wife be a widow. + 10 And without fail let his sons go wandering about; + And they must do begging, And they must look for [food] from their desolate places. + 11 Let the usurer lay out traps for all that he has, + And let strangers + make plunder of his product of toil. + 12 May he come to have no one extending loving-kindness, + And may there prove to be no one showing favor to his fatherless boys. 13 Let his posterity be for cutting off. + In the following generation let their name be wiped out. + 14 Let the error of his forefathers be remembered to Jehovah, + And the sin of his mother + —may it not be wiped out. + 15 Let them prove to be in front of Jehovah constantly; + And may he cut off the remembrance * of them from the very earth; + 16 For the reason that he did not remember to exercise loving-kindness, + But he kept pursuing the afflicted and poor man * + And the one dejected at heart, to put [him] to death. + 17 And he kept loving the malediction, + so that it came upon him; + And he did not take delight in the blessing, + So that it became far away from him; + 18 And he came to be clothed with malediction as his garment. + So it came like waters into the midst of him + And like oil into his bones. 19 May it prove to be for him like a garment with which he enwraps himself + And as a girdle that he keeps girded about himself constantly. + 20 This is the wages from Jehovah of the one resisting me + And of those speaking evil against my soul. + 21 But you are Jehovah the Sovereign + Lord. Deal with me for the sake of your name. + Because your loving-kindness is good, deliver + me. 22 For I am afflicted and poor, + And my heart itself has been pierced * within me. + 23 Like a shadow when it declines, I am obliged to go away; + I have been shaken off like a locust. 24 My knees themselves have swayed from fasting, + And my very flesh has grown lean, without any oil. + 25 And to them I myself have become something reproachable. + They see me—they begin wagging their head. + 26 Help me, O Jehovah my God; + Save me according to your loving-kindness. + 27 And may they know that this is your hand; + That you yourself, O Jehovah, have done it. + 28 Let them, for their part, pronounce a malediction, + But may you, for your part, pronounce a blessing. + They have risen up, but let them be ashamed, + And let your own servant rejoice. + 29 Let those resisting me be clothed with humiliation, + And let them enwrap themselves with their shame just as with a sleeveless coat. + 30 I shall laud Jehovah very much with my mouth, + And in among many people I shall praise him. + 31 For he will stand at the right hand of the poor, + To save [him] from those judging his soul.
