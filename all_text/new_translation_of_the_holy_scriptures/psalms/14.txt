Of David. 14 The senseless one has said in his heart: “There is no Jehovah.” * + They have acted ruinously, + they have acted detestably in [their] dealing. There is no one doing good. * + 2 As for Jehovah, he has looked down from heaven itself upon the sons of men, + To see whether there exists anyone having insight, anyone seeking Jehovah. * + 3 They have all turned aside, + they are [all] alike corrupt; + There is no one doing good, + Not even one. * + 4 Have none of the practicers of what is hurtful got knowledge, + Eating up my people as they have eaten bread? + They have not called even upon Jehovah. + 5 There they were filled with a great dread, * + For Jehovah * is among the generation of the righteous one. + 6 The counsel of the afflicted one YOU people would put to shame, Because Jehovah is his refuge. + 7 O that out of Zion there were the salvation of Israel! + When Jehovah gathers back the captive ones of his people, + Let Jacob be joyful, let Israel rejoice. + Footnotes ^ One of eight scribal changes from YHWH to ʼElo·himʹ .
