Masʹkil. * Of David. 55 Do give ear, O God, to my prayer; + And do not hide yourself from my request for favor. + 2 Do pay attention to me and answer me. + I am driven restlessly about by my concern, + And I cannot but show disquietude, 3 Due to the voice of the enemy, because of the pressure of the wicked one. + For they keep dropping upon me what is hurtful, + And in anger they harbor animosity against me. + 4 My very heart is in severe pain within me, + And the frights of death itself have fallen upon me. + 5 Fear, yes, trembling itself enters into me, + And shuddering covers me. 6 And I keep saying: “O that I had wings as a dove has! + I would fly away and reside. + 7 Look! I would go far away in flight; + I would lodge in the wilderness. + — Seʹlah — 8 I would hasten to a place of escape for me From the rushing * wind, from the tempest.” + 9 Confuse, O Jehovah, * divide their tongue, + For I have seen violence and disputing in the city. + 10 Day and night they go round about it upon its walls; + And hurtfulness and trouble are within it. + 11 Adversities are within it; And from its public square oppression and deception have not moved away. + 12 For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; + Otherwise I could put up with it. It was not an intense hater of me that assumed great airs against me; + Otherwise I could conceal myself from him. + 13 But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, + One familiar to me and my acquaintance, + 14 Because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; + Into the house of God we used to walk with the throng. + 15 Desolations [be] upon them! + Let them go down into Sheʹol alive; + For during their alien residence bad things have been within them. + 16 As for me, to God I shall call out; + And Jehovah himself will save me. + 17 Evening and morning and noontime I cannot but show concern and I moan, + And he hears my voice. + 18 He will certainly redeem [and put] my soul in peace from the fight that is against me, + For in multitudes they have come to be against me. + 19 God * will hear and answer them, + Even He that is sitting [enthroned] as in the past + — Seʹlah — Those with whom there are no changings * + And who have not feared God. + 20 He has thrust out his hands against those at peace with him; + He has profaned his covenant. + 21 Smoother than butter * are [the words of] his mouth, + But his heart is disposed to fight. * + His words are softer than oil, + But they are drawn swords. + 22 Throw your burden * upon Jehovah himself, + And he himself will sustain you. + Never will he allow the righteous one to totter. + 23 But you yourself, O God, will bring them down to the lowest pit. + As for bloodguilty and deceitful men, * they will not live out half * their days. + But as for me, I shall trust in you. + Footnotes ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ “Calumniating,” according to another derivation of the participle. ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
