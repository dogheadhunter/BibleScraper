Masʹkil. * Of David, when Doʹeg the Eʹdom·ite came and proceeded to tell Saul and say to him that David had come to the house of A·himʹe·lech. + 52 Why do you make your boast over what is bad, O you mighty one? + The loving-kindness * of God * is all day long. + 2 Adversities your tongue schemes up, sharpened like a razor, + Working deceitfully. * + 3 You have loved what is bad more than what is good, + Falsehood more than speaking righteousness. + Seʹlah. 4 You have loved all devouring words, + O you deceitful tongue. * + 5 God himself will also pull you down forever; + He will knock you down and tear you away from [your] tent, + And he will certainly root you out of the land of the living ones. + Seʹlah. 6 And the righteous ones will see [it] and will be afraid, + And over him they will laugh. + 7 Here is the able-bodied man that does not put God as his fortress, + But that trusts in the abundance of his riches, + That takes shelter in adversities by him. + 8 But I shall be like a luxuriant olive tree + in God’s house; I do trust in the loving-kindness of God to time indefinite, even forever. + 9 I will laud you to time indefinite, for you have taken action; + And I shall hope in your name, because it is good, in front of your loyal ones. + Footnotes ^ See 32:Sup ftn. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “Ruinous things you scheme, your tongue being sharpened like a razor, O you worker of deceit.” ^ Lit., “tongue of deception.” Previous Next Print Share Share
