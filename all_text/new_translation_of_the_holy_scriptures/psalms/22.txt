A melody of David. 22 My God, my God, why have you left me? * + [Why are you] far from saving me, + [From] the words of my roaring? * + 2 O my God, * I keep calling by day, and you do not answer; + And by night, and there is no silence on my part. + 3 But you are holy, + Inhabiting the praises of Israel. + 4 In you our fathers trusted; + They trusted, and you kept providing them with escape. + 5 To you they cried out, + and they got away safe; + In you they trusted, and they did not come to shame. + 6 But I am a worm, + and not a man, * A reproach to men * and despicable to the people. + 7 As for all those seeing me, they hold me in derision; + They keep opening their mouths wide, * they keep wagging [their] head: + 8 “He committed himself * to Jehovah. + Let Him provide him with escape! + Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” + 9 For you were the One drawing me forth from the belly, + The One making me trust while upon the breasts of my mother. + 10 Upon you I have been thrown from the womb; + From the belly of my mother you have been my God. * + 11 Do not keep far off from me, because distress is nearby, + Because there is no other helper. + 12 Many young bulls have surrounded me; + The powerful ones of Baʹshan themselves have got around me. + 13 They have opened against me their mouth, + As a lion tearing in pieces and roaring. + 14 Like water I have been poured out, + And all my bones have been separated from one another. + My heart has become like wax; + It has melted deep in my inward parts. + 15 My power * has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware, + And my tongue is made to stick to my gums; * + And in the dust of death you are setting me. + 16 For dogs have surrounded me; + The assembly of evildoers themselves have enclosed me. + Like a lion [they are at] my hands and my feet. * + 17 I can count all my bones. + They themselves look, they gaze upon me. + 18 They apportion my garments among themselves, + And upon my clothing they cast lots. + 19 But you, O Jehovah, O do not keep far off. + O you my strength, + do make haste to my assistance. + 20 Do deliver from the sword my soul, + My only one * from the very paw of the dog; + 21 Save me from the mouth of the lion, + And from the horns of wild bulls you must answer [and save] me. + 22 I will declare your name + to my brothers; + In the middle of the congregation * I shall praise you. + 23 Y OU fearers of Jehovah, praise him! + All YOU the seed of Jacob, glorify him! + And be frightened at him, all YOU the seed of Israel. + 24 For he has neither despised + Nor loathed the affliction of the afflicted one; + And he has not concealed his face from him, + And when he cried to him for help he heard. + 25 From you my praise will be in the large congregation; + My vows I shall pay in front of those fearing him. + 26 The meek ones will eat and be satisfied; + Those seeking him will praise Jehovah. + May YOUR hearts * live forever. + 27 All the ends of the earth will remember and turn back to Jehovah. + And all the families of the nations will bow down before you. + 28 For the kingship belongs to Jehovah, + And he is dominating the nations. + 29 All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and will bow down; + Before him all those going down to the dust will bend down, + And no one will ever preserve his own soul * alive. + 30 A seed * itself will serve him; + It will be declared concerning Jehovah * to the generation. + 31 They will come and tell of his righteousness + To the people that is to be born, that he * has done [this]. + Footnotes ^ “Hind of.” Heb., ʼai·yeʹleth, the doe of the fallow deer. ^ “My God , my God , why have you left me?” Heb., ʼE·l iʹ, ʼE·l iʹ, la·mahʹ ʽazav· taʹni?; Syr., ʼA·lah i ʼA·lah i lema·naʼ sebaq· tani?
