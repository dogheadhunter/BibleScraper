A melody. Of Aʹsaph. + A song. 76 God is known in Judah; + In Israel his name is great. + 2 And his covert proves to be in Saʹlem itself, + And his dwelling place in Zion. + 3 There he broke the flaming shafts of the bow, + The shield and the sword and the battle. + Seʹlah. 4 You are enveloped with light, more majestic than the mountains of prey. + 5 The ones powerful in heart have been despoiled, + They have drowsed away to their sleep, + And none of all the valiant men have found their hands. + 6 From your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the charioteer and the horse have fallen fast asleep. + 7 You—fear-inspiring you are, + And who can stand before you because of the strength of your anger? + 8 From heaven you caused the legal contest to be heard; + The earth itself feared and kept quiet + 9 When God rose up to judgment, + To save all the meek of the earth. + Seʹlah. 10 For the very rage of man * will laud you; + The remainder of raging you will gird upon yourself. * 11 Vow and pay to Jehovah YOUR God, all YOU who are round about him. + Let them bring a gift in fear. + 12 He will humble * the spirit of leaders; + Fear-inspiring he is to the kings of the earth. + Footnotes ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “You will gird upon yourself,” M; LXXVg, “will keep festival (celebrate) to you.” ^ Or, “cut off.” Previous Next Print Share Share
