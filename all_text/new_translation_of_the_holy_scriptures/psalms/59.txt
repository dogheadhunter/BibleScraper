Mikʹtam. * When Saul sent, and they kept watching the house, to put him to death. + 59 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; + From those rising up against me may you protect me. + 2 Deliver me from the practicers of what is hurtful, + And from bloodguilty men save me. 3 For, look! they have lain in wait for my soul; + Strong ones make an attack upon me, + For no revolt on my part, nor any sin on my part, O Jehovah. + 4 Though there is no error, they run and get themselves ready. + Do rouse yourself at my calling and see. + 5 And you, O Jehovah God of armies, are the God of Israel. + Do wake up to turn your attention to all the nations. + Do not show favor to any hurtful traitors. + Seʹlah. 6 They keep returning at evening time; + They keep barking like a dog + and go all around the city. + 7 Look! They make a bubbling forth with their mouth; + Swords are on their lips, + For who is listening? + 8 But you yourself, O Jehovah, will laugh at them; + You will hold all the nations in derision. + 9 O my Strength, * toward you I will keep watch; + For God is my secure height. + 10 The God of loving-kindness * to me * will himself confront me; + God himself will cause me to look upon my foes. + 11 Do not kill them, that my people may not forget. + By your vital energy make them wander about, + And bring them down, O our shield Jehovah, * + 12 [For] the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips; + And may they be caught in their pride, + Even for the cursing and the deception that they rehearse. 13 Bring [them] to an end in rage; + Bring [them] to an end, that they may not be; And may they know that God is ruling in Jacob to the ends of the earth. + Seʹlah. 14 And let them return at evening time; Let them bark like a dog and go all around the city. + 15 Let those very ones wander about for something to eat; + Let them not be satisfied or stay overnight. + 16 But as for me, I shall sing of your strength, + And in the morning I shall joyfully tell about your loving-kindness. + For you have proved to be a secure height for me + And a place to which to flee in the day of my distress. + 17 O my Strength, to you I will make melody, + For God is my secure height, the God of loving-kindness to me. + Footnotes ^ See 16:Sup ftn. ^ “My Strength,” TLXXVg and several Heb. mss; M, “His (One’s) Strength.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “To me,” M margin T and many Heb. mss. ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
