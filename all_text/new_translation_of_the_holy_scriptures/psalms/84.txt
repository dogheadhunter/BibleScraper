A melody. 84 How lovely your grand tabernacle is, + O Jehovah of armies! + 2 My soul has yearned and also pined away for the courtyards of Jehovah. + My own heart and my very flesh cry out joyfully to the living God. * + 3 Even the bird itself has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she has put her young ones— Your grand altar, * O Jehovah of armies, my King and my God! * 4 Happy are those dwelling in your house! + They still keep on praising you. + Seʹlah. 5 Happy are the men * whose strength is in you, * + In whose heart are the highways. + 6 Passing along through the low plain of the baʹca bushes, + They turn it into a spring itself; Even with blessings the instructor + enwraps himself. 7 They will walk on from vital energy to vital energy; + Each one appears to God in Zion. * + 8 O Jehovah God * of armies, do hear my prayer; + Do give ear, O God of Jacob. + Seʹlah. 9 O shield of ours, see, O God, + And look upon the face of your anointed one. * + 10 For a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand [elsewhere]. + I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God + Rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness. + 11 For Jehovah God is a sun + and a shield; + Favor and glory are what he gives. + Jehovah himself will not hold back anything good from those walking in faultlessness. + 12 O Jehovah of armies, happy is the man * that is trusting in you. + Footnotes ^ See 8:Sup and ftn. ^ Or, “the living Divine One .” Heb., ʼEl- chaiʹ . ^ Lit., “your altars,” pl., likely to denote grandeur.
