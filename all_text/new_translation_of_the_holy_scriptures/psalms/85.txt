Of the sons of Koʹrah. A melody. 85 You have taken pleasure, O Jehovah, in your land; + You have brought back * the ones taken captive of Jacob. + 2 You have pardoned the error of your people; + You have covered all their sin. + Seʹlah. 3 You have controlled * all your fury; + You have turned back from the heat of your anger. + 4 Gather us back, * O God of our salvation, + And break off your vexation with us. + 5 Is it to time indefinite that you will be incensed at us? + Will you draw out your anger to generation after generation? + 6 Will you yourself not enliven us again, + That your people themselves may rejoice in you? + 7 Show us, O Jehovah, your loving-kindness, * + And your salvation may you give to us. + 8 I will hear what the [true] God Jehovah will speak, + For he will speak peace to his people + and to his loyal ones, But let them not return to self-confidence. + 9 Surely his salvation is near to those fearing him, + For glory to reside in our land. + 10 As for loving-kindness and trueness, * they have met each other; + Righteousness and peace—they have kissed each other. + 11 Trueness itself will sprout out of the very earth, + And righteousness itself will look down from the very heavens. + 12 Also, Jehovah, for his part, will give what is good, + And our own land will give its yield. + 13 Before him righteousness itself will walk, + And it will make a way by his steppings. + Footnotes ^ To agree with TLXXSyVg; M, “you have returned to (with).” ^ Lit., “gathered in.” ^ Or, “Return to us,” MT; LXXSyVg, “Bring us back.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Or, “and truth .” Heb., we ·ʼemethʹ .
