Seʹlah. 6 Do arise, O Jehovah, in your anger; + Lift yourself up at the outbursts of fury of those showing hostility to me, + And do awake for me, * + [since] you have given command for judgment itself. + 7 And let the very assembly of national groups * surround you, And against it do you return on high. 8 Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples. + Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness + And according to my integrity + in me. 9 Please, may the badness of wicked ones come to an end, + And may you establish the righteous one; + And God as righteous * + is testing out heart + and kidneys. * + 10 The shield for me is upon God, + a Savior of those upright in heart. + 11 God * is a righteous Judge, + And God * is hurling denunciations * every day. 12 If anyone will not return, + His sword he will sharpen, + His bow he will certainly bend, * and he will make it ready [for shooting]. + 13 And for himself he must prepare the instruments of death; + His arrows he will make flaming ones. + 14 Look! There is one that is pregnant with what is hurtful, + And he has conceived trouble and is bound to give birth to falsehood. + 15 A pit he has excavated, and he proceeded to dig it; + But he will fall into the hole [that] he went making. + 16 His trouble will return upon his own head, + And upon the crown of his head his own violence will descend. + 17 I shall laud Jehovah according to his righteousness, + And I will make melody to the name + of Jehovah the Most High. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Cush the son of Jemini.” ^ “A dirge.” Heb., shig·ga·yohnʹ . The meaning is uncertain but may denote a highly emotional song with rapid changes of rhythm. If derived from the verb sha·ʼaghʹ, shig·ga·yohnʹ may mean a roaring cry from joy or danger. In Hab 3:1 it is pl. LXXVg, “A psalm.” ^ “My soul .” Heb., naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam . See App 4A . ^ “For me,” M; LXXVg, “O Jehovah my God.” ^ “National groups.” Heb., leʼum·mimʹ . Possibly this should read ʼelo·himʹ, making the phrase read, “let the very assembly of gods.” Compare 82:1. ^ Or, “and the deepest emotions .” Heb., u· khela·yohthʹ . ^ “God as righteous.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ tsad·diqʹ . The title ʼElo·himʹ is pl., and the adjective tsad·diqʹ is sing. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ, followed by a sing. adjective. See vs 9 ftn, “Righteous.” ^ “And God.” Heb., weʼElʹ . ^ Or, “God is denouncing.” LXXVg, “he is not getting angry.” ^ Lit., “tread,” often by firmly planting the foot against the middle of the bow.
