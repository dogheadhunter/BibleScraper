He is fear-inspiring above all [other] gods. + 5 For all the gods * of the peoples are valueless gods; * + But as for Jehovah, he has made the very heavens. + 6 Dignity and splendor are before him; + Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. + 7 Ascribe * to Jehovah, * O YOU families of the peoples, + Ascribe to Jehovah * glory and strength. + 8 Ascribe to Jehovah * the glory belonging to his name; + Carry a gift and come into his courtyards. + 9 Bow down to Jehovah * in holy adornment; * + Be in severe pains because of him, all [ YOU people of] the earth. * + 10 Say among the nations: “Jehovah * himself has become king. + The productive land * also becomes firmly established so that it cannot be made to totter. + He will plead the cause of the peoples in uprightness.” + 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful. * + Let the sea thunder and that which fills it. + 12 Let the open field exult and all that is in it. + At the same time let all the trees of the forest break out joyfully + 13 Before Jehovah. * For he has come; + For he has come to judge the earth. + He will judge the productive land * with righteousness + And the peoples with his faithfulness. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “all the earth,” but the verb “sing” is masc. pl. See 33:8 and 66:1 ftns, “Earth.” ^ LXX has the superscription: “When the house was built after the captivity: a song of David”; Vg is similar. ^ Or, “worthless gods.” Heb., ʼeli·limʹ; LXXVg, “demons.” ^ “Gods of.” Heb., ʼelo·hehʹ; Gr., the·oiʹ; Lat., diʹi . ^ Or, “Give,” pl., Heb., ha·vuʹ . ^ See App 1C §8. ^ See App 1C §8. ^ See App 1C §8. ^ See App 1C §8. ^ “In his holy courtyard,” LXXSyVg. ^ See vs 1 ftn, “Earth.” ^ See App 1C §8. ^ “The productive land.” Heb., te·velʹ; LXX, “The inhabited earth”; Vg c (Lat.), orʹbem terʹrae, “The circle of the earth.” ^ In M the initial letters of the first four Heb. words in this vs, when read from right to left, form an acrostic of the Tetragrammaton, יהוה ( YHWH ), which is God’s exclusive name. When transliterated, the four words read: ­ Y is·mechuʹ ­ H ash·sha·maʹyim ­ W etha·ghelʹ H a·ʼaʹrets . The Heb.
