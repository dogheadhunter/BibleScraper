Masʹkil. * 32 Happy is the one whose revolt is pardoned, whose sin is covered. + 2 Happy is the man * to whose account Jehovah does not put error, + And in whose spirit there is no deceit. + 3 When I kept silent my bones wore out through my groaning * all day long. + 4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me. + My life’s moisture has been changed as in the dry heat of summer. + Seʹlah. 5 My sin I finally confessed to you, and my error I did not cover. + I said: “I shall make confession over my transgressions to Jehovah.” + And you yourself pardoned the error of my sins. + Seʹlah. 6 On this account every loyal one will pray to you + At such a time only as you may be found. + As for the flood of many waters, they will not touch him himself. + 7 You are a place of concealment for me; you will safeguard me from distress itself. + With joyful cries at providing escape you will surround me. + Seʹlah. 8 “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. + I will give advice with my eye upon you. * + 9 Do not make yourselves like a horse or mule without understanding, + Whose spiritedness is to be curbed even by bridle or halter + Before [they] will come near * to you.” + 10 Many are the pains that the wicked one has; + But as for the one trusting in Jehovah, * loving-kindness * itself surrounds him. + 11 Rejoice in Jehovah * and be joyful, YOU righteous ones; + And cry out joyfully, all YOU who are upright in heart. + Footnotes ^ “Maskil.” Heb., mas·kilʹ, possibly meaning “contemplative poem.” Some think 2Ch 30:22 , which uses a word of similar form rendered as “acting with discretion,” furnishes a clue to its meaning. LXX, “Of quick understanding.” See 53:2 ftn, “Insight.” ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “roaring.” ^ “I will fix my eye upon you,” by a slight correction. ^ Or, “that they may not come near.” Lit., “there is not a coming near.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive construct. ^ See App 1C §10. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ See App 1C §10.
