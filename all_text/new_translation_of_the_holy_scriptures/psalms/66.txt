A song, a melody. 66 Shout in triumph to God, all [ YOU people of] the earth. * + 2 Make melody to the glory of his name. + Render his praise glorious. + 3 Say to God: “How fear-inspiring your works are! + Because of the abundance of your strength your enemies will come cringing to you. + 4 All [people of] the earth will bow down to you, + And they will make melody to you, they will make melody to your name.” + Seʹlah. 5 Come, YOU people, and see the activities of God. + His dealing with the sons of men * is fear-inspiring. + 6 He has changed the sea into dry land; + Through the river they went crossing over on foot. + There we began to rejoice in him. + 7 He is ruling by his mightiness to time indefinite. + Upon the nations his own eyes keep watch. + As for those who are stubborn, let them not be exalted in themselves. + Seʹlah. 8 Bless our God, O YOU peoples, + And cause the voice of praise to him to be heard. + 9 He is setting our soul in life, * + And he has not allowed our foot to totter. + 10 For you have examined us, O God; + You have refined us as when refining silver. + 11 You have brought us into a hunting net; + You have put pressure on our hips. 12 You have made mortal man to ride over our head; + We have come through fire and through water, + And you proceeded to bring us forth to relief. + 13 I shall come into your house with whole burnt offerings; + I shall pay to you my vows + 14 That my lips have opened up to say + And that my mouth has spoken when I was in sore straits. + 15 Whole burnt offerings of fatlings I shall offer up to you, + With the sacrificial smoke of rams. I shall render up a bull with he-goats. + Seʹlah. 16 Come, listen, all YOU who fear God, and I will relate + What he has done for my soul. + 17 To him I called with my mouth, + And there was an extolling with my tongue. + 18 If I have regarded anything hurtful in my heart, Jehovah * will not hear [me]. + 19 Truly God has heard; + He has paid attention to the voice of my prayer. + 20 Blessed be God, who has not turned aside my prayer, Nor his loving-kindness from me. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “O all the earth,” with a pl. verb.
