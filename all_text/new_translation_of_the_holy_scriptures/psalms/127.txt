Of Solomon. 127 Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, + It is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. + Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, + It is to no avail that the guard has kept awake. + 2 To no avail it is for YOU men that YOU are rising up early, + That YOU are sitting down late, + That YOU are eating food * with pains. + Just like this he gives sleep even to his beloved one. * + 3 Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; + The fruitage of the belly is a reward. + 4 Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, * + So are the sons of youth. + 5 Happy is the able-bodied man * that has filled + his quiver with them. They will not be ashamed, + For they will speak with enemies in the gate.
