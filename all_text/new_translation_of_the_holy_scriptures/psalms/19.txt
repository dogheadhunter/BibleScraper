A melody of David. 19 The heavens are declaring the glory of God; * + And of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. + 2 One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth, + And one night after another night shows forth knowledge. + 3 There is no speech, and there are no words; No voice on their part is being heard. + 4 Into all the earth their measuring line * has gone out, + And to the extremity of the productive land * their utterances. + In them he has set a tent for the sun, + 5 And it is like a bridegroom when coming out of his nuptial chamber; + It exults as a mighty man does to run in a path. + 6 From one extremity of the heavens is its going forth, And its [finished] circuit is to their [other] extremities; + And there is nothing concealed from its heat. + 7 The law + of Jehovah is perfect, + bringing back the soul. + The reminder + of Jehovah is trustworthy, + making the inexperienced one wise. + 8 The orders + from Jehovah are upright, + causing the heart to rejoice; + The commandment + of Jehovah is clean, + making the eyes shine. + 9 The fear + of Jehovah is pure, standing forever. The judicial decisions + of Jehovah are true; * + they have proved altogether righteous. + 10 They are more to be desired than gold, * yes, than much refined gold; * + And sweeter than honey + and the flowing honey of the combs. + 11 Also, your own servant has been warned by them; + In the keeping of them there is a large reward. + 12 Mistakes—who can discern? + From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. + 13 Also from presumptuous acts * hold your servant back; + Do not let them dominate me. + In that case I shall be complete, + And I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. 14 Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart + Become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock + and my Redeemer. * + Footnotes ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “Their measuring line .” Heb., qaw· wamʹ; LXXVg, “sound”; Sy, “tidings.” ^ “Productive land.” Heb., the·velʹ; LXX, “inhabited earth”; Lat., orʹbis terʹrae, “circle of the earth.” ^ Lit., “truth.” ^ “Yes, than . . . refined gold .” Heb., u·mip· pazʹ . ^ “Than gold .” Heb., miz ·za·havʹ . ^ Or, “men; ones [masc.].” ^ “And my Redeemer ( Repurchaser ).” By extension of thought, “and my Avenger ( Vindicator ).” Heb., we gho·ʼal iʹ; Lat., re·demʹptor .
