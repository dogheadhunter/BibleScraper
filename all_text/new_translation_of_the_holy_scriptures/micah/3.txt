And the sun will certainly set upon the prophets, and the day must get dark upon them. + 7 And the visionaries + will have to be ashamed, + and the diviners + will certainly be disappointed. And they will have to cover over the mustache, + all of them, for there is no answer from God.’” * + 8 And, on the other hand, I myself have become full of power, with the spirit of Jehovah, and of justice and mightiness, + in order to tell to Jacob his revolt and to Israel his sin. + 9 Hear, please, this, YOU head ones of the house of Jacob and YOU commanders of the house of Israel, + the ones detesting justice and the ones who make even everything that is straight crooked; + 10 building Zion with acts of bloodshed and Jerusalem with unrighteousness. + 11 Her own head ones judge merely for a bribe, + and her own priests instruct just for a price, + and her own prophets practice divination simply for money; * + yet upon Jehovah they keep supporting themselves, saying: “Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? + There will come upon us no calamity.” + 12 Therefore on account of YOU men Zion will be plowed up as a mere field, and Jerusalem herself will become mere heaps of ruins, + and the mountain of the house will be as the high places of a forest.
