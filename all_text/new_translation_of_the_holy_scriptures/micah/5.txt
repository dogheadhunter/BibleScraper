And he will certainly bring about deliverance from the As·syrʹi·an, + when he comes into our land and when he treads upon our territory. 7 “And the remaining ones * of Jacob + must become in the midst of many peoples like dew from Jehovah, + like copious showers upon vegetation, + that does not hope for man * or wait for the sons of earthling man. * + 8 And the remaining ones of Jacob must become among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of a forest, like a maned young lion among droves of sheep, which, when it actually passes through, certainly both tramples down and tears in pieces; + and there is no deliverer. 9 Your * hand will be high above your adversaries, + and all enemies of yours will be cut off.” + 10 “And it must occur in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “that I will cut off your horses from the midst of you and destroy your chariots. + 11 And I will cut off the cities of your land and tear down all your fortified places. + 12 And I will cut off sorceries out of your hand, and no practicers of magic will you continue to have. + 13 And I will cut off your graven images and your pillars from the midst of you, and you will no more bow down to the work of your hands. + 14 And I will uproot your sacred poles * + from the midst of you and annihilate your cities. 15 And in anger and in rage I will execute vengeance upon the nations that have not obeyed.” + Footnotes ^ MLXXSy end chap. 4 here; TLXX Bagster Vg begin chap. 5 with this vs. ^ Meaning “House of Bread.” Heb., Behth-leʹchem . ^ “You,” masc. sing. ^ “Origin,” according to BDB, p. 426 and KB, p. 505. ^ See App 1C §2. ^ See App 1C §2. ^ See Jer 16:19 ftn. ^ Or, “of earthling men.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Possibly, “our soil (ground),” in agreement with LXXSy. ^ Or, “mankind.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “For man .” Heb., le ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “the remainder; the remnant.” ^ “Your,” masc. sing. ^ Or, “Asherim.” Previous Next Print Share Share
