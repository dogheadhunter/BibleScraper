And in what way have I tired you out? + Testify against me. + 4 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, + and from the house of slaves I redeemed you; + and I proceeded to send before you Moses, Aaron and Mirʹi·am. + 5 O my people, remember, + please, what Baʹlak the king of Moʹab counseled, + and what Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor answered him. + From Shitʹtim * + it was, all the way to Gilʹgal, + to the intent that the righteous acts of Jehovah might be known.” + 6 With what shall I confront + Jehovah? [With what] shall I bow myself to God on high? + Shall I confront him with whole burnt offerings, + with calves a year old? 7 Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of torrents of oil? + Shall I give my firstborn son for my revolt, the fruitage of my belly for the sin of my soul? + 8 He has told you, O earthling man, * what is good. + And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice + and to love kindness * + and to be modest + in walking with your God? + 9 To the city the very voice of Jehovah calls out, + and [the person of] practical wisdom will fear your name. + Hear [the] rod and who it was that designated it, * + O YOU people. 10 Do there yet exist [in] the house of a wicked one the treasures of wickedness, + and the scrimped eʹphah measure that is denounced? 11 Can I be [morally] clean with wicked scales and with a bag of deceptive stone weights? + 12 For her own rich men have become full of violence, and her own inhabitants have spoken falsehood, + and their tongue is tricky in their mouth. + 13 “And I also, for my part, shall certainly make [you] sick by striking you; + there will be a desolating [of you], on account of your sins. + 14 You, for your part, will eat and not get satisfied, and your emptiness will be in the midst of you. * + And you will remove [things], but you will not carry [them] safely away; and whatever you would carry away safely, I shall give to the sword itself. + 15 You, for your part, will sow seed, but you will not reap. You, for your part, will tread olives, but you will not grease yourself with oil; also sweet wine, but you will not drink wine. + 16 And the statutes of Omʹri + and all the work of the house of Aʹhab are observed, + and YOU people walk in their counsels; + to the end that I may make you an object of astonishment and her inhabitants something to be whistled at; + and the reproach of peoples * YOU men will bear.” + Footnotes ^ “Hear, then, Jehovah’s word.
