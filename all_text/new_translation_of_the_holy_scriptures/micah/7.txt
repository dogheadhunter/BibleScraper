Do not put YOUR trust in a confidential friend. + From her who is lying in your bosom guard the openings of your mouth. + 6 For a son is despising a father; a daughter is rising up against her mother; + a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; + a man’s enemies are the men * of his household. + 7 But as for me, it is for Jehovah that I shall keep on the lookout. + I will show a waiting attitude for the God of my salvation. + My God will hear me. + 8 Do not rejoice over me, O you woman enemy of mine. + Although I have fallen, I shall certainly rise up; + although I dwell in the darkness, + Jehovah will be a light to me. + 9 The raging of Jehovah I shall bear—for I have sinned against him + —until he conducts my legal case and actually executes justice for me. + He will bring me forth to the light; I shall look upon his righteousness. + 10 And my enemy will see, and shame will cover her, + who was saying to me: “Where is he, Jehovah your God?” + My own eyes will look upon her. + Now she will become a place of trampling, like the mire of streets. + 11 The day for building your * stone walls, at that day [the] decree * will be far away. + 12 At that day even all the way to you they * will come from As·syrʹi·a and the cities of Egypt, * and from Egypt even all the way to [the] River; + and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to the mountain. + 13 And the land must become a desolate waste on account of its inhabitants, because of the fruit of their dealings. + 14 Shepherd your * people with your staff, + the flock of your inheritance, the one who was residing alone in a forest—in the midst of an orchard. + Let them feed on Baʹshan and Gilʹe·ad + as in the days of a long time ago. + 15 “As in the days of your coming forth from the land of Egypt I shall show him wonderful things. + 16 Nations will see and become ashamed of all their mightiness. + They will put [their] hand upon [their] mouth; + their very ears will become deaf. 17 They will lick up dust like the serpents; + like reptiles of [the] earth they will come in agitation out of their bulwarks. + To Jehovah our God * they will come quivering, and they will be afraid of you.” + 18 Who is a God * like you, + one pardoning error and passing over transgression + of the remnant of his inheritance? + He will certainly not hold onto his anger forever, for he is delighting in loving-kindness. * + 19 He will again show us mercy; + he will subject our errors. + And you will throw into the depths of [the] sea all their * sins. + 20 You will give [the] trueness [given] to Jacob, [the] loving-kindness [given] to Abraham, which you swore to our forefathers from the days of long ago. + Footnotes ^ Or, “The one of loving-kindness.” Heb., cha·sidhʹ . ^ Or, “the land .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ Or, “among earthling men .” Heb., ba· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Men of.” Heb., ʼan·shehʹ, pl. of ʼish, which is earlier rendered “a man’s” in this sentence. ^ “Your,” fem. sing. ^ Or, “prescribed limit.” ^ “They,” LXX; MSyVg, “he,” or “one.” ^ “Egypt.” Heb., Ma·tsohrʹ . ^ “Your,” masc. sing. ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ Or, “loyal love.” Heb., cheʹsedh . ^ “Their,” M; LXXSyVg, “our”; T, “Israel’s.” Previous Next Print Share Share
