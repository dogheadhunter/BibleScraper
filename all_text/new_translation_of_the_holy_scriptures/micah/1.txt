Jehovah * is going forth from his place, + and he will certainly come down and tread upon earth’s high places. + 4 And the mountains must melt under him, + and the low plains themselves will split apart, like wax because of the fire, + like waters being poured down a steep place. 5 “It is because of the revolt of Jacob that there is all this, even because of the sins of the house of Israel. + What is the revolt of Jacob? Is it not Sa·marʹi·a? + And what are the high places * of Judah? + Are they not Jerusalem? 6 And I shall certainly make Sa·marʹi·a a heap of ruins of the field, + the planting places of a vineyard; and I will pour down into the valley her stones, and her foundations I shall lay bare. + 7 And her graven images will all be crushed to pieces, + and all the gifts [made] to her as her hire will be burned in the fire; + and all her idols I shall make a desolate waste. For from the things given as the hire of a prostitute she collected [them], and to the thing given as the hire of a prostitute they will return.” + 8 On this account I will wail and howl; + I will walk barefoot and naked. + I shall make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like female ostriches. * 9 For the stroke * upon her is unhealable; + for it has come as far as Judah, + [the] plague as far as the gate of my people, as far as Jerusalem. + 10 “In Gath do not YOU men tell [it] out; positively do not weep. + “In the house of Aphʹrah wallow in the very dust. + 11 Make your way across, O inhabitress of Shaʹphir, in shameful nudity. + The inhabitress of Zaʹa·nan has not gone forth. The wailing of Beth-eʹzel will take from YOU people its standing place. 12 For the inhabitress of Maʹroth has waited for good, + but what is bad has come down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem. + 13 Attach the chariot to the team of horses, O inhabitress of Laʹchish. + The beginning of sin was what she was to the daughter of Zion, + for in you * the revolts of Israel have been found. + 14 Therefore you will give parting gifts to Moʹresh·eth-gath. + The houses of Achʹzib + were as something deceitful to the kings of Israel. 15 The dispossessor * I shall yet bring to you, + O inhabitress of Ma·reʹshah. + As far as A·dulʹlam + the glory of Israel will come. 16 Cause baldness, and shear [your hair] off on account of your sons of exquisite delight. + Broaden out your baldness like [that of] the eagle, because they have gone away from you into exile.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the Morashtite.” ^ See App 1C §2. ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
