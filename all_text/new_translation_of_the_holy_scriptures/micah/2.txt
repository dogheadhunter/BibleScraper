To the unfaithful one he apportions out our own fields.” 5 Therefore you will come to have no one casting out the cord, by lot, + in the congregation * of Jehovah. 6 Do not YOU people let [words] drop. + They let [words] drop. They will not let [words] drop concerning these [things]. Humiliations will not move away. + 7 “‘Is it being said, O house of Jacob: + “Has the spirit of Jehovah * become discontented, or are these his dealings?” + Do not my own words do good + in the case of the one walking uprightly? + 8 “‘And yesterday my own people proceeded to rise up as an outright enemy. + From the front of a garment YOU men strip off the majestic ornament, from the ones passing by confidently, [like] those returning from war. 9 The women of my people YOU drive out from the house in which a woman * has exquisite delight. From off her children YOU take my splendor, + to time indefinite. + 10 Get up and go, + because this is not a resting-place. + Because of the fact that she has become unclean, + there is a wrecking; and [the] wrecking work is painful. + 11 If a man, * walking by wind * and falsehood, has told the lie: + “I shall let [words] drop to you concerning wine and concerning intoxicating liquor,” he also will certainly become the one letting [words] drop for this people. + 12 “‘I shall positively gather Jacob, all of you; + I shall without fail collect the remaining ones * of Israel together. + In unity I shall set them, like a flock in the pen, * like a drove in the midst of its pasture; + they will be noisy with men.’ * + 13 “The one making a breakthrough will certainly come up before them: + they will actually break through. And they will pass through a gate, and they will go out by it. + And their king will pass through before them, with Jehovah at the head of them.” + Footnotes ^ “An able-bodied man.” Heb., geʹver . ^ “A man .” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ “In the congregation of.” Heb., bi q·halʹ ; Gr., ek·kle·siʹai .
