I have sanctified + this house that you have built by putting my name + there to time indefinite; and my eyes + and my heart will certainly prove to be there always. + 4 And you, if you will walk + before me, just as David + your father walked, with integrity + of heart and with uprightness + by doing according to all that I have commanded you, + and you will keep my regulations + and my judicial decisions, + 5 I also shall indeed establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel to time indefinite, * just as I promised David your father, saying, ‘Not a man of yours will be cut off from [sitting] upon the throne of Israel.’ + 6 If YOU yourselves and YOUR sons should definitely turn back from following me + and not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have put before YOU men, and YOU actually go and serve other gods + and bow down to them, * 7 I will also cut Israel off from upon the surface of the ground that I have given to them; + and the house that I have sanctified to my name I shall throw away * from before me, + and Israel will indeed become a proverbial saying + and a taunt among all the peoples. 8 And this house itself will become heaps of ruins. * + Everyone passing by it will stare in amazement + and will certainly whistle and say, ‘For what reason did Jehovah do like that to this land and this house?’ + 9 And they will have to say, ‘For the reason that they left Jehovah their God who had brought their forefathers out from the land of Egypt, + and they proceeded to take hold of other gods + and bow down to them and serve them. That is why Jehovah brought upon them all this calamity.’” + 10 And it came about at the end of twenty years, in which Solʹo·mon built the two houses, the house of Jehovah + and the house of the king, + 11 (Hiʹram + the king of Tyre had himself assisted Solʹo·mon + with timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper trees and with gold as much as he delighted in,) + that at that time King Solʹo·mon proceeded to give to Hiʹram twenty cities in the land of Galʹi·lee. * + 12 Accordingly Hiʹram went out from Tyre to see the cities that Solʹo·mon had given him, and they were not just right in his eyes. + 13 So he said: “What sort of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?” And they came to be called the Land of Caʹbul * down to this day. 14 In the meantime Hiʹram sent to the king a hundred and twenty talents * of gold. + 15 Now this is the account of those conscripted for forced labor + that King Solʹo·mon levied to build the house of Jehovah + and his own house and the Mound * + and the wall + of Jerusalem and Haʹzor + and Me·gidʹdo + and Geʹzer. + 16 (Pharʹaoh the king of Egypt himself had come up and then captured Geʹzer and burned it with fire, and the Caʹnaan·ites + dwelling in the city he had killed. So he gave it as a parting gift to his daughter, + the wife of Solʹo·mon.) 17 And Solʹo·mon went on to build Geʹzer and Lower Beth-hoʹron, + 18 and Baʹal·ath + and Taʹmar * in the wilderness, in the land, 19 and all the storage + cities that became Solʹo·mon’s and the chariot cities + and the cities for the horsemen, and the desirable things of Solʹo·mon + that he had desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebʹa·non and in all the land of his dominion. 20 As for all the people remaining over from the Amʹor·ites, + the Hitʹtites, + the Perʹiz·zites, + the Hiʹvites + and the Jebʹu·sites, + who were no part of the sons of Israel, + 21 their sons who had been left over after them in the land whom the sons of Israel had been unable to devote to destruction, + Solʹo·mon kept levying them for slavish forced labor until this day. + 22 And there were none of the sons of Israel that Solʹo·mon constituted slaves; + for they were the warriors and his servants and his princes and his adjutants and chiefs of his charioteers and of his horsemen. + 23 These were the chiefs of the deputies who were over the work of Solʹo·mon, five hundred and fifty, the foremen over the people who were active in the work. + 24 However, Pharʹaoh’s daughter + herself came up out of the City of David + to her own house that he had built for her. It was then that he built the Mound. + 25 And Solʹo·mon continued three + times in the year to offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices upon the altar that he had built for Jehovah, + and there was a making of sacrificial smoke * on the [altar], + which was before Jehovah; and he completed the house. + 26 And there was a fleet of ships that King Solʹo·mon made in Eʹzi·on-geʹber, + which is by Eʹloth, + upon the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Eʹdom. + 27 And Hiʹram kept sending in the fleet of ships his own servants, + seamen, * having a knowledge of the sea, along with the servants of Solʹo·mon. 28 And they proceeded to go to Oʹphir + and take from there four hundred and twenty talents * of gold + and bring it in to King Solʹo·mon.
