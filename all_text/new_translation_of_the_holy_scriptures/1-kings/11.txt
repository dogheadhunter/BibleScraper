He was in Eʹdom. + 15 And it came about when David struck down Eʹdom, * + when Joʹab the chief of the army came up to bury those slain, that he tried to strike down every male in Eʹdom. + 16 (For it was six months that Joʹab and all Israel dwelt there until he had cut off every male in Eʹdom.) 17 And Haʹdad went running away, he and some Eʹdom·ite men of the servants of his father with him, to come into Egypt, while Haʹdad was a young * boy. 18 So they rose up out of Midʹi·an + and came into Paʹran and took men with them from Paʹran + and came into Egypt to Pharʹaoh the king of Egypt, who then gave him a house. Also, bread he assigned to him, and land he gave him. 19 And Haʹdad continued to find favor + in the eyes of Pharʹaoh, so much that he gave him a wife, + the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahʹpe·nes the lady. 20 In time the sister of Tahʹpe·nes bore him Ge·nuʹbath his son, and Tahʹpe·nes got to wean + him right inside the house of Pharʹaoh; and Ge·nuʹbath continued at the house of Pharʹaoh right among the sons of Pharʹaoh. 21 And Haʹdad himself heard in Egypt that David had lain down with his forefathers + and that Joʹab the chief of the army had died. + So Haʹdad said to Pharʹaoh: “Send me away, + that I may go to my own land.” 22 But Pharʹaoh said to him: “What are you in need of while with me that here you are seeking to go to your own land?” To this he said: “Nothing; but you ought to send me away without fail.” 23 And God proceeded to raise up to him another resister, + namely, Reʹzon the son of E·liʹa·da, who had run away from Had·ad·eʹzer + the king of Zoʹbah + his lord. * 24 And he kept collecting men to his side and came to be chief of a marauder band, when David killed them. * + So they went to Damascus + and took up dwelling in it and began reigning in Damascus. 25 And he came to be a resister of Israel all the days of Solʹo·mon, + and that along with the injury that Haʹdad did; and he had an abhorrence + of Israel while he continued reigning over Syria. 26 And there was Jer·o·boʹam + the son of Neʹbat an Eʹphra·im·ite from Zerʹe·dah, a servant of Solʹo·mon, + and his mother’s name was Ze·ruʹah, a widowed woman. He too began to lift up his hand against the king. + 27 And this is the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solʹo·mon himself had built the Mound. * + He had closed up the gap of the City of David his father. + 28 Now the man Jer·o·boʹam was a valiant, mighty man. + When Solʹo·mon got to see that the young man was a hard worker, + he proceeded to make him overseer * + over all the compulsory service + of the house of Joseph. + 29 And it came about at that particular time that Jer·o·boʹam himself went out from Jerusalem, and A·hiʹjah + the Shiʹlo·nite + the prophet got to find him on the road, and [A·hiʹjah] * was covering himself with a new garment; and the two of them were by themselves in the field. 30 A·hiʹjah now took hold of the new garment that was on him and ripped + it into twelve + pieces. 31 And he went on to say to Jer·o·boʹam: “Take for yourself ten pieces; for this is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Here I am ripping the kingdom out of the hand of Solʹo·mon, and I shall certainly give you ten tribes. + 32 And the one tribe + is what will continue his for the sake of my servant David + and for the sake of Jerusalem, + the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. 33 The reason why is that they have left me + and begun to bow down to Ashʹto·reth + the goddess * of the Si·doʹni·ans, to Cheʹmosh + the god * of Moʹab and to Milʹcom + the god of the sons of Amʹmon; and they have not walked in my ways by doing what is right in my eyes and my statutes and my judicial decisions like David his father. 34 But I shall not take the entire kingdom out of his hand, because a chieftain * I shall set him for all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, + because he kept my commandments and my statutes. 35 And I shall certainly take the kingship out of the hand of his son and give it to you, even ten tribes. + 36 And to his son I shall give one tribe, in order that David my servant may continue having a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, + the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there. + 37 And you are the one that I shall take, and you will indeed reign over all that your soul craves, + and you will certainly become king over Israel. 38 And it must occur that, if you obey all that I shall command you, and you do walk in my ways and actually do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, just as David my servant did, + I will also prove to be with you, + and I will build you a lasting house, just as I have built for David, + and I will give you Israel. 39 And I shall humiliate the offspring of David on account of this, + only not always.’” + 40 And Solʹo·mon began seeking to put Jer·o·boʹam to death. + So Jer·o·boʹam got up and went running + off to Egypt to Shiʹshak + the king of Egypt, and he continued in Egypt until Solʹo·mon’s death. 41 As for the rest of the affairs of Solʹo·mon and all that he did and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the affairs of Solʹo·mon? 42 And the days that Solʹo·mon had reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years. + 43 Then Solʹo·mon lay down with his forefathers, + and was buried in the City of David + his father; and Re·ho·boʹam + his son began to reign in place of him.
