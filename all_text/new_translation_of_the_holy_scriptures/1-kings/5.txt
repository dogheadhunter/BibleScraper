For my part, I shall do all your delight in the matter of timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper + trees. 9 My servants themselves will bring them down out of Lebʹa·non + to the sea; and I, for my part, shall put them in log rafts [to go] by sea clear to the place that you will send me notice of; + and I shall certainly have them broken up there, and you, for your part, will carry them; and you, for your part, will do my delight by giving the food for my household.” + 10 So Hiʹram became a giver of timbers of cedar trees and timbers of juniper trees to Solʹo·mon according to all his delight. 11 And Solʹo·mon, for his part, gave Hiʹram twenty thousand cor + measures of wheat as food supplies for his household and twenty cor * measures of beaten-out + oil. * That was what Solʹo·mon kept giving Hiʹram year by year. + 12 And Jehovah, for his part, gave Solʹo·mon wisdom, just as he had promised him; + and there came to be peace between Hiʹram and Solʹo·mon, and both of them proceeded to conclude a covenant. 13 And King Solʹo·mon kept bringing up those conscripted for forced labor out of all Israel; and those conscripted for forced labor + amounted to thirty thousand men. 14 And he would send them to Lebʹa·non in shifts of ten thousand a month. For a month they would continue in Lebʹa·non, for two months at their homes; + and Ad·o·niʹram + was over those conscripted + for forced labor. + 15 And Solʹo·mon came to have + seventy thousand burden bearers + and eighty thousand cutters + in the mountain, + 16 besides Solʹo·mon’s princely deputies * + who were over the work, three thousand three hundred foremen + over the people who were active in the work. 17 Accordingly the king commanded that they should quarry great stones, expensive stones, + to lay the foundation + of the house with hewn stones. + 18 So Solʹo·mon’s builders and Hiʹram’s builders and the Geʹbal·ites + did the cutting, and they kept preparing the timbers and the stones to build the house.
