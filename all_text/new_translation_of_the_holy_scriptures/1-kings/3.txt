I shall certainly do according to your words. + Look! I shall certainly give you a wise and understanding * heart, + so that one like you there has not happened to be before you, and after you there will not rise up one like you. + 13 And also what you have not requested I will give you, + both riches + and glory, so that there will not have happened to be any among the kings like you, all your days. + 14 And if you will walk in my ways by keeping my regulations + and my commandments, just as David your father walked, + I will also lengthen your days.” + 15 When Solʹo·mon awoke, + why, here it had been a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark + of the covenant of Jehovah * and offered up burnt sacrifices and rendered up communion + offerings and spread a feast + for all his servants. + 16 At that time two women, prostitutes, + got to come in to the king and stand before him. + 17 Then the one woman said: “Excuse me, my lord, + I and this woman are dwelling in one house, so that I gave birth close by her in the house. 18 And it came about on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also proceeded to give birth. And we were together. There was no stranger with us in the house, no one but the two of us in the house. 19 Later the son of this woman died at night, because she lay upon him. 20 So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while your slave girl herself was asleep and laid him in her own bosom, and her dead son she laid in my bosom. 21 When I got up in the morning to nurse + my son, why, there he was dead. So I examined him closely in the morning, and, look! he did not prove to be my son that I had borne.” 22 But the other woman said: “No, but my son is the living one and your son is the dead one!” All the while this woman was saying: “No, but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one.” And they kept on speaking before the king. + 23 Finally the king said: “This one is saying, ‘This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one!’ and that one is saying, ‘No, but your son is the dead one and my son is the living one!’” 24 And the king went on to say: + “Y OU men, get me a sword.” So they brought the sword before the king. 25 And the king proceeded to say: “Y OU men, sever the living child in two and give the one half to the one woman and the other half to the other.” 26 At once the woman whose son was the living one said to the king (for her inward emotions + were excited toward her son, + so that she said): “Excuse me, + my lord! Y OU men, give her the living child. Do not by any means put him to death.” All the while this other woman was saying: “Neither mine nor yours will he become. Y OU men, do the severing!” + 27 At that the king answered and said: “Y OU men, give her the living child, and YOU must by no means put him to death. She is his mother.” 28 And all Israel got to hear of the judicial decision + that the king had handed down; and they became fearful because of the king, + for they saw that the wisdom + of God was within him to execute judicial decision.
