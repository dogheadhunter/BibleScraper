At this she said: “Is your coming peaceable?” + to which he said: “It is peaceable.” 14 And he went on to say: “There is a matter I have for you.” So she said: “Speak.” + 15 And he continued: “You yourself well know that the kingship was to have become mine, and it was toward me that all Israel had set their face for me to become king; + but the kingship turned and came to be my brother’s, for it was from Jehovah that it became his. + 16 And now there is one request that I am making of you. Do not turn my face away.” + Accordingly she said to him: “Speak.” 17 And he went on to say: “Please, say to Solʹo·mon the king (for he will not turn your face away) that he should give me Abʹi·shag + the Shuʹnam·mite + as a wife.” 18 To this Bath-sheʹba said: “Good! I myself shall speak for you to the king.” 19 So Bath-sheʹba came in to King Solʹo·mon to speak to him for Ad·o·niʹjah. + At once the king rose + to meet her and bowed down to her. + Then he sat down upon his throne and had a throne set for the mother of the king, that she might sit at his right. + 20 And she proceeded to say: “There is one little request that I am making of you. Do not turn my face away.” So the king said to her: “Make it, my mother; for I shall not turn your face away.” 21 And she went on to say: “Let Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite be given to Ad·o·niʹjah your brother as a wife.” 22 At this King Solʹo·mon answered and said to his mother: “And why are you requesting Abʹi·shag the Shuʹnam·mite for Ad·o·niʹjah? Request also for him the kingship + (because he is my brother older than I am), + even for him and for A·biʹa·thar + the priest and for Joʹab + the son of Ze·ruʹiah.” + 23 With that King Solʹo·mon swore by Jehovah, saying: “So may God do to me, and so may he add to it, + if it was not against his own soul that Ad·o·niʹjah spoke this thing. + 24 And now, as Jehovah is living + who has firmly established me + and keeps me seated upon the throne of David my father + and who made a house + for me just as he has spoken, + today Ad·o·niʹjah will be put to death.” + 25 Immediately King Solʹo·mon sent by means of Be·naiʹah + the son of Je·hoiʹa·da; and he proceeded to fall upon him, so that he died. * + 26 And to A·biʹa·thar + the priest the king said: “Go to Anʹa·thoth + to your fields! For you are deserving of death; * + but on this day I shall not put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah + before David my father, + and because you suffered affliction during all the time that my father suffered affliction.” + 27 So Solʹo·mon drove out A·biʹa·thar from serving as a priest of Jehovah, to fulfill Jehovah’s word that he had spoken against the house of Eʹli + in Shiʹloh. + 28 And the report itself came clear to Joʹab + —for Joʹab himself had inclined to follow Ad·o·niʹjah, + although Abʹsa·lom * he had not inclined to follow + —and Joʹab went fleeing to the tent + of Jehovah and began to hold fast to the horns of the altar. + 29 Then King Solʹo·mon was told: “Joʹab has fled to the tent of Jehovah, and there he is beside the altar.” So Solʹo·mon sent Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, saying: “Go, fall upon him!” + 30 Accordingly Be·naiʹah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him: “This is what the king has said, ‘Come on out!’” But he said: “No! For here + is where I shall die.” At that Be·naiʹah brought word back to the king, saying: “This is what Joʹab spoke, and this is what he answered me.” 31 Then the king said to him: “Do just as he has spoken and fall upon him; and you must bury him and remove from off me and from off the house of my father the blood * + undeservedly shed that Joʹab spilled. + 32 And Jehovah will certainly bring back his blood upon his own head, + because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he was, + and he proceeded to kill them with the sword, when my father David himself had not known of it, + namely, Abʹner + the son of Ner the chief of the army of Israel + and A·maʹsa + the son of Jeʹther the chief of the army of Judah. + 33 And their blood must come back upon the head of Joʹab and upon the head of his offspring to time indefinite; + but for David + and for his offspring and for his house and for his throne there will come to be peace to time indefinite from Jehovah.” + 34 Then Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da went on up + and fell upon him and put him to death; + and he got to be buried at his own house in the wilderness. 35 Upon that the king put Be·naiʹah + the son of Je·hoiʹa·da in place of him over the army; + and Zaʹdok the priest the king put * in the place of A·biʹa·thar. + 36 Finally the king sent and called Shimʹe·i + and said to him: “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and you must dwell there and not go out from there to this place and that. 37 And it must occur that on the day of your going out and when you do pass over the torrent valley of Kidʹron, + you should unmistakably know that you will positively die. + Bloodguilt for you * will itself come to be upon your own head.” + 38 At this Shimʹe·i said to the king: “The word is good. Just as my lord the king has spoken is the way that your servant will do.” And Shimʹe·i kept dwelling in Jerusalem many days. 39 And it came about at the end of three years that two slaves + of Shimʹe·i went running away to Aʹchish + the son of Maʹa·cah the king of Gath; + and people came telling Shimʹe·i, saying: “Look! Your slaves are at Gath.” 40 Immediately Shimʹe·i got up and saddled his ass and went to Gath to Aʹchish to look for his slaves; after which Shimʹe·i went and brought his slaves from Gath. 41 Then Solʹo·mon was told: “Shimʹe·i has gone out of Jerusalem to Gath and is back.” 42 At that the king sent and called + Shimʹe·i and said to him: “Did I not put you under oath by Jehovah that I might warn you, + saying, ‘On the day of your going outside and when you do go here and there you should unmistakably know that you will positively die,’ and so did you not say to me, ‘Good is the word that I have heard’? + 43 Why, then, did you not keep the oath of Jehovah + and the commandment that I solemnly laid upon you?” + 44 And the king went on to say to Shimʹe·i: “You yourself certainly know all the injury which your heart well knows that you did to David my father; + and Jehovah will certainly return the injury by you upon your own head. + 45 But King Solʹo·mon will be blessed, + and the throne of David itself will prove to be firmly established before Jehovah forever.” * + 46 With that the king commanded Be·naiʹah the son of Je·hoiʹa·da, who then went out and fell upon him, so that he died. + And the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solʹo·mon. + Footnotes ^ Or, “reminders; exhortations.” ^ Or, “faithfulness.” ^ “ Sheol .” Heb., sheʼolʹ ; Gr., haiʹdou ; Syr., la· shiul ; Lat., inʹfe·ros .
