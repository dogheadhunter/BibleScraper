At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses the matter should stand good. + 16 In case a witness scheming violence should rise up against a man to bring a charge of revolt against him, + 17 the two men who have the dispute must also stand before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who will be acting in those days. + 18 And the judges must search thoroughly, + and if the witness is a false witness and has brought a false charge against his brother, 19 YOU must also do to him just as he had schemed to do to his brother, + and you must clear away what is bad from your midst. + 20 So those who remain will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything bad like this in your midst. + 21 And your eye should not feel sorry: + soul will be for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. + Footnotes ^ Or, “cut.” ^ Lit., “strike him to the soul,” M; LXXVg, “strike his soul.” ^ “The avenger (goel) of blood .” Heb., go·ʼelʹ had· damʹ ; Vg, “the neighbor of him whose blood was shed.” ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Lit., “bloods.” Heb., da·mimʹ . ^ See vs 6 ftn, “Blood.” ^ See App 1C §1.
