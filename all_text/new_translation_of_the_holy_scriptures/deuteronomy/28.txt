From the heavens it will come down upon you until you have been annihilated. 25 Jehovah will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. + By one way you will go out against them, but by seven ways you will flee before them; and you must become a frightful object to all the earth’s kingdoms. + 26 And your dead body must become food for every flying creature of the heavens and to the beast of the field, * with no one to make [them] tremble. + 27 “Jehovah will strike you with the boil of Egypt + and piles and eczema and skin eruption, from which you will not be able to be healed. 28 Jehovah will strike you with madness + and loss of sight + and bewilderment of heart. + 29 And you will indeed become one who gropes about at midday, just as a blind man gropes about in the gloom, + and you will not make your ways successful; and you must become only one who is always defrauded and robbed, with no one to save you. + 30 You will become engaged to a woman, but another man will rape her. + You will build a house, but you will not dwell in it. + You will plant a vineyard, but you will not begin to use it. + 31 Your bull slaughtered there before your eyes—but you will not eat any of it. Your ass taken in robbery from before your face—but it will not return to you. Your sheep given to your enemies—but you will have no savior. + 32 Your sons and your daughters given to another people + and your eyes looking on and yearning for them always—but your hands * will be without power. + 33 The fruitage of your ground and all your production a people will eat whom you have not known; + and you must become one who is only defrauded and crushed always. + 34 And you will certainly become maddened at the sight of your eyes that you will see. + 35 “Jehovah will strike you with a malignant boil upon both knees and both legs, from which you will not be able to be healed, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. + 36 Jehovah will march you + and your king + whom you will set up over you to a nation whom you have not known, neither you nor your forefathers; and there you will have to serve other gods, of wood and of stone. + 37 And you must become an object of astonishment, + a proverbial saying + and a taunt among all the peoples to whom Jehovah will lead you away. 38 “A lot of seed you will take out to the field, but little will you gather, + because the locust will devour it. + 39 Vineyards you will plant and certainly cultivate, but you will drink no wine and gather nothing in, + because the worm will eat it up. + 40 You will come to have olive trees in all your territory, but you will rub yourself with no oil, because your olives will drop off. + 41 Sons and daughters you will bring forth, but they will not continue yours, because they will go off into captivity. + 42 All your trees and the fruitage of your ground whirring insects * will take in possession. 43 The alien resident who is in your midst will keep ascending higher and higher above you, while you—you will keep descending lower and lower. + 44 He will be the one to lend to you, while you—you will not lend to him. + He will become the head, while you—you will become the tail. + 45 “And all these maledictions + will certainly come upon you and pursue you and overtake you until you have been annihilated, + because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God by keeping his commandments and his statutes that he commanded you. + 46 And they must continue on you and your offspring as a sign and a portent to time indefinite, + 47 due to the fact that you did not serve Jehovah your God with rejoicing and joy + of heart * for the abundance of everything. + 48 And you will have to serve your enemies + whom Jehovah will send against you with hunger + and thirst and nakedness and the want of everything; and he will certainly put an iron yoke upon your neck until he has annihilated you. + 49 “Jehovah will raise up against you a nation far away, + from the end of the earth, just as an eagle pounces, + a nation whose tongue you will not understand, + 50 a nation fierce in countenance, + who will not be partial to an old man or show favor to a young man. + 51 And they will certainly eat the fruit of your domestic animals and the fruitage of your ground until you have been annihilated, + and they will let no grain, new wine or oil, no young of your cattle or progeny of your flock, remain for you until they have destroyed you. + 52 And they will indeed besiege you within all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you are trusting fall in all your land, yes, they will certainly besiege you within all your gates in all your land, which Jehovah your God has given you. + 53 Then you will have to eat the fruit of your belly, the flesh of your sons and your daughters, + whom Jehovah your God has given you, because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in. 54 “As for the very delicate and dainty man among you, his eye + will be evil-inclined toward his brother and his cherished wife and the remainder of his sons whom he has remaining, 55 so as not to give one of them any of the flesh of his sons that he will eat, because he has nothing at all remaining to him because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in within all your gates. + 56 As for the delicate and dainty woman among you who never attempted to set the sole of her foot upon the earth for being of dainty habit and for delicateness, + her eye will be evil-inclined toward her cherished husband and her son and her daughter, 57 even toward her afterbirth that comes out from between her legs and toward her sons whom she proceeded to bear, + because she will eat them in secrecy for the want of everything because of the tightness and stress with which your enemy will hem you in within your gates. + 58 “If you will not take care to carry out all the words of this law that are written in this book + so as to fear this glorious + and fear-inspiring + name, even Jehovah, + your God, 59 Jehovah also will certainly make your plagues and the plagues of your offspring especially severe, great and long-lasting plagues, + and malignant and long-lasting sicknesses. + 60 And he will indeed bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt before which you got scared, and they will certainly hang onto you. + 61 Also, any sickness and any plague that is not written in the book of this law, Jehovah * will bring them upon you until you have been annihilated. 62 And YOU will indeed be left with very few in number, + although YOU have become like the stars of the heavens for multitude, + because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah * your God. 63 “And it must occur that just as Jehovah exulted over YOU to do YOU good and to multiply YOU , + so Jehovah will exult over YOU to destroy YOU and to annihilate YOU ; + and YOU will simply be torn away from off the soil to which you are going to take possession of it. + 64 “And Jehovah * will certainly scatter you among all the peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth, + and there you will have to serve other gods whom you have not known, neither you nor your forefathers, wood and stone. + 65 And among those nations you will have no ease, + nor will there prove to be any resting-place for the sole of your foot; and Jehovah * will indeed give you there a trembling heart + and a failing of the eyes + and despair of soul. 66 And you will certainly be in the greatest peril for your life * and be in dread night and day, and you will not be sure of your life. + 67 In the morning you will say, ‘If it only were evening!’ * and in the evening you will say, ‘If it only were morning!’ * because of the dread of your heart with which you will be in dread and because of the sight of your eyes that you will see. + 68 And Jehovah will certainly bring you back to Egypt by ships by the way about which I have said to you, ‘You will never see it again,’ + and YOU will have to sell yourselves there to your enemies as slave men and maidservants, + but there will be no buyer.” Footnotes ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “Sword,” MSy;
