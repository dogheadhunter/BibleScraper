They have made themselves a molten image.’ + 13 And Jehovah went on to say this to me, ‘I have seen this people, and, look! it is a stiff-necked people. + 14 Let me alone that I may annihilate + them and wipe out their name from under the heavens, + and let me make you a nation mightier and more populous than they are.’ + 15 “After that I turned and went down from the mountain, while the mountain was burning with fire; + and the two tablets of the covenant were in both my hands. + 16 Then I looked, and there YOU had sinned against Jehovah YOUR God! Y OU had made yourselves a molten calf. + Y OU had turned aside quickly from the way about which Jehovah had commanded YOU . + 17 At that I took hold of the two tablets and flung them down from both my hands and shattered them before YOUR eyes. + 18 And I proceeded to prostrate myself before Jehovah, as at first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate bread nor drank water, + because of all YOUR sin that YOU had committed in doing evil in the eyes of Jehovah so as to offend him. + 19 For I was scared because of the hot anger with which Jehovah had got indignant at YOU to the point of annihilating YOU . + However, Jehovah listened to me also that time. + 20 “At Aaron, too, Jehovah got very incensed to the point of annihilating him; + but I made supplication + also in behalf of Aaron at that particular time. 21 And YOUR sin that YOU had made, the calf, + I took, and I proceeded to burn it in the fire and to crush it, grinding it thoroughly until it had become fine like dust; after which I threw its dust into the torrent that was descending from the mountain. + 22 “Further, at Tabʹe·rah + and at Masʹsah + and at Kibʹroth-hat·taʹa·vah + YOU proved yourselves provokers of Jehovah to anger. + 23 And when Jehovah sent YOU out of Kaʹdesh-barʹne·a, + saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land that I shall certainly give YOU !’ then YOU behaved rebelliously against the order of Jehovah YOUR God, + and YOU did not exercise faith + toward him and did not listen to his voice. + 24 Y OU have proved yourselves rebellious in behavior with Jehovah + from the day of my knowing YOU . 25 “So I kept prostrating myself before Jehovah forty days and forty nights, + for I prostrated myself thus because Jehovah talked * of annihilating YOU . + 26 And I began to make supplication + to Jehovah and to say, ‘O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, * do not bring to ruin your people, even your private property, * + whom you redeemed with your greatness, whom you brought out of Egypt + with a strong hand. + 27 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. + Do not turn your face to the hardness of this people and their wickedness and their sin, + 28 for fear the land * + out of which you brought us may say: “Because Jehovah was unable to bring them into the land that he had promised them, and because he hated them he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.” + 29 They are, too, your people and your private property + whom you brought out with your great power and your outstretched arm.’ + Footnotes ^ According to LXXSyVg; MSam, “upon them there was [the same] as all the words.” ^ “The congregation .” Heb., haq· qa·halʹ ; Gr., ek·kle·siʹas .
