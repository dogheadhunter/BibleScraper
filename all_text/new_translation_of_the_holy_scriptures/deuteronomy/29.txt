+ Why the heat of this great anger?’ 25 Then they will have to say, ‘It was because they abandoned the covenant + of Jehovah the God of their forefathers, which he concluded with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. + 26 And they proceeded to go and serve other gods and to bow down to them, gods that they had not known and he had not apportioned to them. + 27 Then Jehovah’s anger blazed against that land by bringing upon it the whole malediction written in this book. + 28 Hence Jehovah uprooted them from off their soil in anger + and rage and great indignation and threw them into another land as at this day.’ + 29 “The things concealed + belong to Jehovah * our God, but the things revealed + belong to us and to our sons * to time indefinite, that we may carry out all the words of this law. + Footnotes ^ MSamLXX end chapter 28 here, with this as vs 69. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Or, “mind.” ^ According to LXXSy; MSam, “your heads, your tribes”; Vg, “your princes and tribes.” ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Or, “cutter.” ^ See Ge 24:41 ftn. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Or, “oath-bound curse,” because the Heb. modifier “written” is sing.

To us and to our sons it belongs for time indefinite to carry out all the words of this law.” In Al and Leningrad B 19 A the words “to us and to our sons,” and in Al the first consonant of the following Heb. preposition “to,” have extraordinary points over them. This is understood by some to mean that these words should either be omitted or not be emphasized. However, these words were written in LXX P. Fouad Inv. 266 of the first cent. B.C.E. One of the 15 cases of extraordinary points. See App 2A . Previous Next Print Share Share
