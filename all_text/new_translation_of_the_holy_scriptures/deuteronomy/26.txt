I have not overstepped your commandments, nor have I forgotten. + 14 I have not eaten of it during my mourning, * nor have I removed any of it while unclean, nor have I given any of it for anyone dead. I have listened to the voice of Jehovah * my God. I have done in accord with all that you have commanded me. 15 Do look down from your holy dwelling, + the heavens, and bless your people Israel + and the soil that you have given us, just as you swore to our forefathers, + the land flowing with milk and honey.’ + 16 “This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to carry out these regulations and judicial decisions; + and you must observe and carry them out with all your heart + and all your soul. + 17 Jehovah you have induced to say today that he will become your God while you walk in his ways and observe his regulations + and his commandments + and his judicial decisions + and listen to his voice. + 18 As for Jehovah, he has induced you to say today that you will become his people, a special property, + just as he has promised you, + and that you will observe all his commandments, 19 and that he will put you high above all the other nations that he has made, + resulting in praise and reputation and beauty, while you prove yourself a people holy to Jehovah your God, + just as he has promised.” Footnotes ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “Your,” MSamSyVg; LXX, “my.” ^ Lit., “My father was a perishing Aramaean,” MSam; Sy, “My father was led to Aram”; LXX, “My father cast off Syria.” ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “The year of the tenth, you must also give it,” MSamSyVg; LXX, “you will give the second tenth.” ^ Or, “of it in my state of taboo.” ^ See App 1C §1.
