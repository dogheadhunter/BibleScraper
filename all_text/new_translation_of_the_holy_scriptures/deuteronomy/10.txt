There Aaron died, and he got to be buried there; + and El·e·aʹzar his son began to act as priest instead of him. + 7 From there they pulled away for Gudʹgo·dah, and from Gudʹgo·dah for Jotʹba·thah, + a land of torrent valleys running with water. 8 “At that particular time Jehovah separated the tribe of Leʹvi + to carry the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, + to stand before Jehovah for ministering to him + and to bless in his name until this day. + 9 That is why Leʹvi has come to have no share and inheritance + with his brothers. Jehovah is his inheritance, just as Jehovah your God had said to him. + 10 And I—I stayed * in the mountain the same as the first days, forty days and forty nights, + and Jehovah proceeded to listen to me also on that occasion. + Jehovah did not want to bring you to ruin. + 11 Then Jehovah said to me, ‘Get up, go before the people for a pulling away, that they may go in and take possession of the land that I have sworn to their forefathers to give to them.’ + 12 “And now, O Israel, what is Jehovah your God asking of you + but to fear + Jehovah your God, so as to walk in all his ways + and to love him + and to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul; + 13 to keep the commandments of Jehovah and his statutes + that I am commanding you today, for your good? + 14 Behold, to Jehovah your God belong the heavens, + even the heavens of the heavens, the earth + and all that is in it. 15 Only to your forefathers did Jehovah get attached so as to love them, so that he chose their offspring after them, + even YOU , out of all the peoples, as at this day. 16 And YOU must circumcise the foreskin of YOUR hearts + and not harden * YOUR necks any longer. + 17 For Jehovah YOUR God is the God of gods * + and the Lord of lords, * + the God * great, mighty and fear-inspiring, + who treats none with partiality + nor accepts a bribe, * + 18 executing judgment for the fatherless boy and the widow + and loving the alien resident + so as to give him bread and a mantle. 19 Y OU too must love the alien resident, + for YOU became alien residents in the land of Egypt. + 20 “Jehovah your God you should fear. + Him you should serve, + and to him you should cling, + and by his name you should make sworn statements. + 21 He is the One for you to praise, * + and he is your God, who has done with you these great and fear-inspiring things that your eyes have seen. + 22 With seventy souls your forefathers went down into Egypt, + and now Jehovah your God has constituted you like the stars of the heavens for multitude. + Footnotes ^ “The Ten Words ,” that is, words of command, commandments.
