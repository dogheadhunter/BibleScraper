and you must rejoice + before Jehovah your God in every undertaking of yours. 19 Watch out for yourself that you may not abandon the Levite + all your days on your soil. 20 “When Jehovah your God will widen out your territory, * + just as he has promised you, + and you will be certain to say, ‘Let me eat meat,’ because your soul craves to eat meat, whenever your soul craves it you may eat meat. + 21 In case the place that Jehovah your God will choose to put his name + there should be far away from you, you must then slaughter some of your herd or some of your flock that Jehovah has given you, just as I have commanded you, and you must eat inside your gates whenever your soul craves it. + 22 Only in the way that the gazelle and the stag may be eaten, + so you may eat it: the unclean + one and the clean one together may eat it. 23 Simply be firmly resolved not to eat the blood, + because the blood is the soul + and you must not eat the soul with the flesh. * 24 You must not eat it. You should pour it out upon the ground as water. + 25 You must not eat it, in order that it may go well with you + and your sons after you, because you will do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes. + 26 Merely your holy things + that will become yours, and your vow offerings + you should carry, and you must come to the place that Jehovah will choose. + 27 And you must render up your burnt offerings, + the flesh and the blood, + upon the altar of Jehovah your God; and the blood of your sacrifices should be poured out against the altar of Jehovah + your God, but the flesh you may eat. 28 “Watch, and you must obey all these words that I am commanding you, + in order that it may go well with you + and your sons after you to time indefinite, because you will do what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God. + 29 “When Jehovah your God will cut off from before you the nations to whom you are going to dispossess them, + you must also dispossess them and dwell in their land. + 30 Watch out for yourself for fear you may be entrapped after them, + after they have been annihilated from before you, and for fear you may inquire respecting their gods, saying, ‘How was it these nations used to serve * their gods? And I, yes, I, will do the same way.’ 31 You must not do that way to Jehovah your God, + for everything detestable to Jehovah that he does hate they have done to their gods, for even their sons and their daughters they regularly burn in the fire to their gods. * + 32 Every word that I am commanding YOU is what YOU should be careful to do. + Y OU must not add to it nor take away from it. + Footnotes ^ Or, “their Asherim.” ^ Or, “there, to his residence.” ^ Or, “your tithes.” ^ Or, “in all the gain of your hand.” ^ “Gates,” MSamLXX; SyVg, “cities.” ^ “All your gates,” MSam; LXX, “every city”; SyVg, “(all) your cities.” ^ Or, “boundary.” ^ Or, “meat.” ^ Or, “worship.” See 4:19 ftn. ^ MLXX end chapter 12 here.
