For they are a generation of perverseness, + Sons in whom there is no faithfulness. + 21 They, for their part, have incited me to jealousy with what is no god; + They have vexed me with their vain idols; * + And I, for my part, shall incite them to jealousy with what is no people; + With a stupid nation I shall offend them. + 22 For a fire has been ignited in my anger + And it will burn down to Sheʹol, the lowest place, * + And it will consume the earth and its produce + And will set ablaze the foundations of mountains. + 23 I shall increase calamities upon them; + My arrows I shall spend upon them. + 24 Exhausted from hunger + they will be and eaten up by burning fever + And bitter destruction. + And the teeth of beasts I shall send upon them, + With the venom of reptiles of the dust. + 25 Outdoors a sword will bereave them, + And indoors * fright, + Of both young man and virgin, + Suckling together with gray-haired man. + 26 I should have said: “I shall disperse them, * + I will make the mention of them cease from mortal men,” + 27 Were it not that I was afraid of vexation from the enemy, + That their adversaries might misconstrue it, + That they might say: “Our hand * has proved superior, + And it was not Jehovah who worked all this out.” + 28 For they are a nation on whom counsel perishes, + And among them there is no understanding. + 29 O that they were wise! + Then they would ponder over this. + They would consider their end afterward. + 30 How could one pursue a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight? + Not unless their Rock had sold them * + And Jehovah had surrendered them. * 31 For their rock is not like our Rock, * + Even our enemies being the ones to decide. * + 32 For their vine is from the vine of Sodʹom And from the terraces of Go·morʹrah. + Their grapes are grapes of poison, Their clusters are bitter. + 33 Their wine is the venom of big snakes And the cruel poison of cobras. + 34 Is it not laid up with me, With a seal affixed to it in my storehouse? * + 35 Vengeance is mine, and retribution. + At the appointed time their foot will move unsteadily, + For the day of their disaster is near, + And the events in readiness for them do make haste.’ + 36 For Jehovah will judge his people + And he will feel regret over his servants, + Because he will see that support * has disappeared And there is only a helpless and worthless one. * 37 And he will certainly say, ‘Where are their gods, * + The rock in whom they sought refuge, * + 38 Who used to eat the fat of their sacrifices, + To drink the wine of their drink offerings? + Let them get up and help YOU . + Let them become a concealment place for YOU . + 39 S EE now that I—I am he * + And there are no gods together with me. + I put to death, and I make alive. * + I have severely wounded, + and I—I will heal, + And there is no one snatching out of my hand. + 40 For I raise my hand to heaven [in an oath], + And I do say: “As I am alive to time indefinite,” * + 41 If I do indeed sharpen my glittering sword, * + And my hand takes hold on judgment, + I will pay back vengeance to my adversaries + And render retribution to those who intensely hate me. + 42 I shall intoxicate my arrows with blood, + While my sword will eat flesh, + With the blood of the slain and the captives, * With the heads of the leaders of the enemy.’ * + 43 Be glad, YOU nations, with his people, * + For he will avenge the blood of his servants, + And he will pay back vengeance to his adversaries + And will indeed make atonement for the ground of his people.” * 44 Thus Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing * of the people, + he and Ho·sheʹa * the son of Nun. + 45 After Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel, 46 he went on to say to them: “Apply YOUR hearts to all the words that I am speaking in warning to YOU * today, + that YOU may command YOUR sons to take care to do all the words of this law. + 47 For it is no valueless word for YOU , + but it means YOUR life, + and by this word YOU may lengthen YOUR days upon the soil to which YOU are crossing the Jordan to take possession of it.” + 48 And Jehovah proceeded to speak to Moses on this same day, saying: 49 “Go up into this mountain of Abʹa·rim, * + Mount Neʹbo, + which is in the land of Moʹab, which fronts toward Jerʹi·cho, and see the land of Caʹnaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel as a possession. + 50 Then die on the mountain into which you are going up, and be gathered to your people, + just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor + and got to be gathered to his people; 51 for the reason that YOU men acted undutifully toward me + in the middle of the sons of Israel at the waters of Merʹi·bah + of Kaʹdesh in the wilderness of Zin; for the reason that YOU men did not sanctify me * in the middle of the sons of Israel. + 52 For from a distance you will see the land, but you will not go there into the land that I am giving to the sons of Israel.” + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “The Rock , perfect is his activity .” Heb., hats· Tsurʹ ta·mimʹ po·ʽol ohʹ; LXX, “God, true are his works”; Sy, “For without blemish (spotless) are his works”; Vg, “God’s works are perfect.” ^ “A God,” M(Heb., ʼEl )Sam; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ “They have,” SamLXXSyVg; M, “He has.” ^ Or, “ruinously toward him.” ^ “They have sinned; blameworthy children do not belong to him,” LXX. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “When the Most High was dividing nations,” LXXSyVg.
