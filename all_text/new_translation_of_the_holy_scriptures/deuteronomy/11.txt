Of the rain of the heavens it drinks water; 12 a land that Jehovah your God is caring for. The eyes + of Jehovah your God are constantly upon it, from the beginning of the year to the close of the year. 13 “And it must occur that if YOU will without fail obey my commandments + that I am commanding YOU today so as to love Jehovah YOUR God and to serve him with all YOUR heart and all YOUR soul, + 14 I * also shall certainly give rain for YOUR land at its appointed time, + autumn rain and spring rain, * + and you will indeed gather your grain and your sweet wine and your oil. 15 And I shall certainly give vegetation in your field for your domestic animals, + and you will indeed eat and be satisfied. + 16 Watch out for yourselves for fear YOUR heart may be enticed, + and YOU do turn aside and worship other gods and bow down to them, + 17 and Jehovah’s anger does blaze against YOU , and he does shut up the heavens so that no rain will occur + and the ground will not give its produce and YOU have to perish speedily from off the good land that Jehovah is giving YOU . + 18 “And YOU must apply these words of mine to YOUR heart + and YOUR soul and bind them as a sign upon YOUR hand, and they must serve as a frontlet band between YOUR eyes. + 19 Y OU must also teach them to YOUR sons, so as to speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. + 20 And you must write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates, + 21 in order that YOUR days and the days of YOUR sons may be many + on the soil that Jehovah swore to YOUR forefathers to give to them, + as the days of the heavens over the earth. + 22 “For if YOU strictly keep all this commandment + that I am commanding YOU so as to do it, to love Jehovah YOUR God, + to walk in all his ways + and to cling to him, + 23 Jehovah also must drive away all these nations on account of YOU , + and YOU will certainly dispossess nations greater and more numerous than YOU are. + 24 Every place on which the sole of YOUR foot will tread will become YOURS . + From the wilderness up to * Lebʹa·non, from the River, the river Eu·phraʹtes, to the western * sea YOUR boundary will become. + 25 No man will make a firm stand against YOU . + The dread of YOU and the fear of YOU Jehovah YOUR God will put before the face of all the land + on which YOU will tread, just as he has promised YOU . 26 “See, I am putting before YOU today blessing and malediction: + 27 the blessing, provided YOU will obey the commandments of Jehovah YOUR God + that I am commanding YOU today; 28 and the malediction, + if YOU will not obey the commandments of Jehovah YOUR God + and YOU do turn aside from the way about which I am commanding YOU today, so as to walk after other gods whom YOU have not known. 29 “And it must occur that when Jehovah your God brings you into the land to which you are going to take possession of it, + you must also give * the blessing upon Mount Gerʹi·zim + and the malediction upon Mount Eʹbal. + 30 Are they not on the side of the Jordan toward the direction of the sunset, in the land of the Caʹnaan·ites dwelling in the Arʹa·bah, + in front of Gilʹgal, + beside the big trees of Moʹreh? * + 31 For YOU are crossing the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah YOUR God is giving YOU , and YOU must take possession of it and dwell in it. + 32 And YOU must be careful to carry out all the regulations and the judicial decisions + that I am putting before YOU today. + Footnotes ^ Or, “had to water it with your foot,” that is, by some form of foot power, whether on a waterwheel or by forming and opening water channels. ^ “I,” MSy; SamLXXVg c , “he.” ^ Lit., “early (former) rain and latter rain.” ^ “Up to.” Lit., “and,” MSamLXXSyVg. ^ Lit., “hinder,” that is, to one’s back when facing east. ^ Or, “pronounce.” ^ Sam adds, “in front of Shechem.” Previous Next Print Share Share
