+ If we are again hearing the voice of Jehovah our God any further, we are also certain to die. + 26 For who is there of all flesh that has heard the voice of the living God * + speaking out of the middle of the fire as we did and yet goes on living? 27 You yourself go near and hear all that Jehovah our God will say; and you will be the one to speak to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to you, + and we shall certainly listen and do.’ 28 “So Jehovah heard the voice of YOUR words when YOU spoke to me, and Jehovah went on to say to me, ‘I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all they have spoken. + 29 If only * they would develop this heart of theirs to fear me + and to keep all my commandments + always, in order that it might go well with them and their sons to time indefinite! + 30 Go say to them: “Return home to YOUR tents.” 31 And you stand here with me, and let me speak to you all the commandment and the regulations and the judicial decisions that you should teach to them + and that they must do in the land that I am giving them to take possession of it.’ 32 And YOU people must take care to do just as Jehovah YOUR God has commanded YOU . + Y OU must not turn to the right or to the left. + 33 In all the way that Jehovah YOUR God has commanded YOU , YOU should walk, + in order that YOU may live and it may be well with YOU + and YOU may indeed lengthen YOUR days in the land of which YOU will take possession.
