You must not wield an iron tool upon them. + 6 With whole stones you should build the altar of Jehovah your God, and you must offer burnt offerings to Jehovah your God on it. + 7 And you must sacrifice communion sacrifices + and eat them there, + and you must rejoice before Jehovah * your God. + 8 And you must write on the stones all the words of this law, + making them quite clear.” * + 9 Then Moses and the priests, the Levites, spoke to all Israel, saying: “Keep silent and listen, O Israel. This day you have become * the people of Jehovah your God. + 10 And you must listen to the voice of Jehovah * your God and carry out his commandments + and his regulations, + which I am commanding you today.” 11 And Moses went on to command the people on that day, saying: 12 “The following are the ones who will stand to bless the people on Mount Gerʹi·zim + when YOU have crossed the Jordan: Simʹe·on and Leʹvi and Judah and Isʹsa·char and Joseph and Benjamin. 13 And the following are the ones who will stand for the malediction + on Mount Eʹbal: + Reuʹben, Gad and Ashʹer and Zebʹu·lun, Dan and Naphʹta·li. 14 And the Levites must answer and say with raised voice to every man of Israel: + 15 “‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved image + or a molten statue, + a thing detestable to Jehovah, * + the manufacture of the hands of a wood-and-metal worker, + and who has put it in a hiding place.’ (And all the people must answer and say, ‘Amen!’ * ) + 16 “‘Cursed is the one who treats his father or his mother with contempt.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 17 “‘Cursed is the one who moves back the boundary mark of his fellowman.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 18 “‘Cursed is the one who causes the blind to go astray in the way.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 19 “‘Cursed is the one who perverts + the judgment + of an alien resident, + a fatherless boy and a widow.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 20 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered the skirt of his father.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 21 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with any beast.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 22 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 23 “‘Cursed is the one who lies down with his mother-in-law.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 24 “‘Cursed is the one who fatally strikes his fellowman from a hiding place.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 25 “‘Cursed is the one who accepts a bribe to strike a soul fatally, when it is innocent blood.’ * + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) 26 “‘Cursed is the one who will not put the words of this law in force by doing them.’ + (And all the people must say, ‘Amen!’) Footnotes ^ “There should be an observing.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ “Ebal,” MLXXSyVg; Sam, “Gerizim.” ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Or, “explaining them well”; or, “there should be an explaining of them well.” In Heb. this phrase is two verbs in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ Lit., “you have been brought to be.” ^ See App 1C §1. ^ See App 1C §1. ^ Or, “So be it!” Heb., ʼa·menʹ . ^ Lit., “a soul of innocent blood,” MSamLXXSyVg.
