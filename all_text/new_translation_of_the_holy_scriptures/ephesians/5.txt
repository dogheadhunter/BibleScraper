Go on walking as children of light, 9 for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth. + 10 Keep on making sure of what is acceptable + to the Lord; 11 and quit sharing + with [them] in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness, + but, rather, even be reproving + [them], 12 for the things that take place in secret by them it is shameful even to relate. + 13 Now all the things that are being reproved + are made manifest by the light, for everything that is being made manifest + is light. 14 Wherefore he * says: “Awake, + O sleeper, and arise from the dead, + and the Christ will shine + upon you.” 15 So keep strict watch that how YOU walk + is not as unwise but as wise [persons], 16 buying out the opportune time + for yourselves, because the days are wicked. + 17 On this account cease becoming unreasonable, but go on perceiving + what the will + of Jehovah * is. 18 Also, do not be getting drunk + with wine, in which there is debauchery, + but keep getting filled with spirit, + 19 speaking to yourselves with psalms + and praises + to God and spiritual songs, singing + and accompanying yourselves with music + in YOUR hearts to Jehovah, * 20 in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks + always for all things to our * God and Father. 21 Be in subjection to one another + in fear of Christ. 22 Let wives be in subjection + to their husbands as to the Lord, 23 because a husband is head of his wife + as the Christ also is head of the congregation, + he being a savior of [this] body. 24 In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, so let wives also be to their husbands in everything. + 25 Husbands, continue loving YOUR wives, + just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it, + 26 that he might sanctify it, + cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word, + 27 that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, + not having a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but that it should be holy and without blemish. + 28 In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, 29 for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, + as the Christ also does the congregation, 30 because we are members of his body. + 31 “For this reason a man will leave [his] father and [his] mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” + 32 This sacred secret + is great. Now I am speaking with respect to Christ and the congregation. + 33 Nevertheless, also, let each one of YOU individually so love his wife + as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect + for her husband.
