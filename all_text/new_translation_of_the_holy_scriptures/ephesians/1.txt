It is according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself + 10 for an administration * + at the full limit of the appointed times, + namely, to gather + all things together again * in the Christ, + the things in the heavens + and the things on the earth. + [Yes,] in him, 11 in union with whom we were also assigned as heirs, + in that we were foreordained according to the purpose of him who operates all things according to the way his will counsels, + 12 that we should serve for the praise of his glory, + we who have been first to hope * in the Christ. + 13 But YOU also hoped in him after YOU heard the word of truth, + the good news about YOUR salvation. + By means of him also, after YOU believed, * YOU were sealed + with the promised holy spirit, + 14 which * is a token + in advance * of our inheritance, + for the purpose of releasing by a ransom + [God’s] own * possession, + to his glorious praise. 15 That is why I also, since I have heard of the faith YOU have in the Lord Jesus and toward all the holy ones, + 16 do not cease giving thanks for YOU . I continue mentioning YOU in my prayers, + 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give YOU a spirit of wisdom + and of revelation * in the accurate knowledge of him; + 18 the eyes + of YOUR heart having been enlightened, + that YOU may know what is the hope + to which he called YOU , what the glorious riches + are which he holds as an inheritance for * the holy ones, + 19 and what the surpassing greatness of his power + is toward us believers. It is according to the operation + of the mightiness of his strength, 20 with which he has operated in the case of the Christ when he raised him up from the dead + and seated him at his right hand + in the heavenly places, + 21 far above every government and authority and power and lordship + and every name named, + not only in this system of things, * + but also in that to come. + 22 He also subjected all things under his feet, + and made him head over all things + to the congregation, 23 which is his body, + the fullness + of him who fills up all things in all. + Footnotes ^ “In Ephesus,” א c AB c DVgSy h,p ; P 46 א * B * omit. ^ Lit., “a throwing down [of seed].” Gr., ka·ta·bo·lesʹ . ^ Or, “without blemish before him.
