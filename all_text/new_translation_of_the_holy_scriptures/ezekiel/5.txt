As a barbers’ razor you will take it for yourself, and you must make it pass along upon your head and upon your beard, + and you must take for yourself weighing scales and divide [the hair] * in portions. 2 A third you will burn in the very fire in the midst of the city as soon as the days of the siege have come to the full. + And you must take another third. You will strike [it] with the sword all around her, + and the [last] third you will scatter to the wind, * and I shall draw out a sword itself after them. + 3 “And you must take therefrom a few in number and wrap them up in your skirts. + 4 And others of them you will take and you must pitch them into the midst of the fire and incinerate them in the fire. From one * a fire will go forth to all the house of Israel. + 5 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘This is Jerusalem. In the midst of the nations I have set her, with lands all around her. 6 And she proceeded to behave rebelliously against my judicial decisions in wickedness more than the nations, + and against my statutes more than the lands that are all around her, for my judicial decisions they rejected and, as for my statutes, they did not walk in them.’ + 7 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that YOU people were more turbulent * + than the nations that are all around YOU , in my statutes YOU did not walk and my judicial decisions YOU did not perform; + but according to the judicial decisions of the nations that are all around YOU , YOU performed, did YOU not? + 8 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am against you, * [O city,] even I, + and I will execute in the midst of you judicial decisions in the eyes of the nations. + 9 And I will do in you that which I have not done and the like of which I shall not do anymore by reason of all your detestable things. + 10 “‘“Therefore fathers themselves will eat sons in the midst of you, + and sons themselves will eat their fathers, and I will execute in you acts of judgment and scatter all the remainder of you to every wind.”’ * + 11 “‘Therefore as I am alive,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘surely for the reason that it was my sanctuary that you defiled with all your disgusting things + and with all your detestable things, + I myself also am the One that will diminish [you] + and my eye will not feel sorry + and I myself also will not show compassion. + 12 A third of you—by the pestilence they will die, + and by famine they will come to their end in the midst of you. + And another third—by the sword they will fall all around you. And the [last] third I shall scatter even to every wind, + and a sword is what I shall draw out after them. + 13 And my anger will certainly come to its finish + and I will appease my rage on them + and comfort myself; + and they will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have spoken in my insistence on exclusive devotion, + when I bring my rage to its finish upon them. 14 “‘And I shall make you * a devastated place and a reproach among the nations that are all around you before the eyes of every passerby. + 15 And you must become a reproach + and an object of reviling words, + a warning example + and a horror to the nations that are all around you, when I do in you acts of judgment in anger and in rage and in raging reproofs. + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken. 16 “‘When I send the injurious arrows of the famine upon them, + which must prove to be for ruination, which [arrows] I shall send to bring YOU people to ruin, + even famine I shall increase upon YOU people and I will break YOUR rods around which ring-shaped loaves are suspended. * + 17 And I will send upon YOU people famine and injurious wild beasts, + and they must bereave you of children, and pestilence + and blood + themselves will pass along through you, and a sword I shall bring in upon you. + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “divide them.” ^ “To the wind .” Heb., la· ruʹach ; Gr., pneuʹma·ti ; Lat., venʹtum .
