A lioness among lions. * + She lay down in among maned young lions. She reared her cubs. 3 “‘And gradually she brought up one of her cubs. + A maned young lion is what he became, and he began to learn how to tear apart prey. + He devoured even earthling man. * 4 And nations kept hearing about him. In their pit he was caught, and they proceeded to bring him by means of hooks * to the land of Egypt. + 5 “‘When she got to see that she had waited [and] her hope had perished, then she took another of her cubs. + As a maned young lion she put him forth. 6 And he began to walk about in the midst of lions. A maned young lion is what he became. And he gradually learned how to tear apart prey. + He devoured even earthling man. + 7 And he got to know his dwelling towers, * and he devastated even their cities, + so that the land was laid desolate and he filled it with the sound of his roaring. + 8 And nations all around from the jurisdictional districts began to set * against him + and got to spread over him their net. + In their pit he was caught. + 9 Finally they put him in the cage by means of hooks * and brought him to the king of Babylon. * + They got to bring him by means of hunting nets, in order that his voice might no more be heard on the mountains of Israel. + 10 “‘Your mother + was like a vine in your blood, * + planted by waters. A bearer of fruit and full of branches she became because of abundant water. + 11 And they came to be for her strong rods, meant for the scepters of rulers. + And its height gradually became tall up among branches, and it got to be visible because of its tallness, because of the abundance of its foliage. + 12 But she was finally uprooted in fury. + To the earth she was thrown, and there was an east wind that dried up her fruit. + Her strong rod was torn off and became dry. + Fire itself devoured it. + 13 And now she is planted in the wilderness, + in a waterless and thirsty land. + 14 And fire proceeded to come forth from [her] rod. + It devoured her very shoots, her very fruit, and there proved to be in her no strong rod, no scepter for ruling. + “‘That is a dirge, and it will become a dirge.’” + Footnotes ^ “Lions.” Heb., ʼara·yohthʹ, African lions. ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “thorns”; put through the cheek or nose of animals as well as of captives in order to lead them on a rope. ^ “Dwelling towers; palaces,” by the substitution of a letter; M, “widows.” ^ Possibly, “camp,” by changing the letter Taw to Chehth . ^ “Babylon,” LXX­Vg; MTSy, “Babel.” ^ See vs 4 ftn. ^ “In your blood,” MSy­Vg; two Heb. mss, “of your vineyard”; T, “she used to resemble.” Previous Next Print Share Share
