His own blood will come to be upon his own self. And had he himself taken warning, his own soul * would have escaped. + 6 “‘Now as regards the watchman, in case he sees the sword coming and he actually does not blow the horn + and the people itself gets no warning at all and a sword comes and takes away from them soul, for its own error it itself must be taken away, + but its blood I shall ask back from the hand of the watchman * himself.’ + 7 “Now as regards you, O son of man, a watchman is what I have made you to the house of Israel, + and at my mouth you must hear [the] word and give them warning from me. + 8 When I say to someone wicked, ‘O wicked one, you will positively die!’ + but you actually do not speak out to warn the wicked one from his way, + he himself as a wicked one will die in his own error, + but his blood I shall ask back at your own hand. 9 But as regards you, in case you actually warn someone wicked from his way [for him] to turn back from it but he actually does not turn back from his way, he himself will die in his own error, + whereas you yourself will certainly deliver your own soul. * + 10 “Now as regards you, O son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus YOU people have said: “Because our revolts and our sins are upon us and in them we are rotting away, + how, then, shall we keep living?”’ + 11 Say to them, ‘“As I am alive,” is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, “I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, + but in that someone wicked turns back + from his way and actually keeps living. + Turn back, turn back from YOUR bad ways, + for why is it that YOU should die, O house of Israel?”’ + 12 “And as for you, O son of man, say to the sons of your people, ‘The righteousness of the righteous one will not itself deliver him in the day of his revolt. + But as regards the wickedness of the wicked one, he will not be made to stumble by it in the day of his turning back from his wickedness. + Nor will even anyone having righteousness be able to keep living because of it in the day of his sinning. + 13 When I say to the righteous one: “You will positively keep living,” and he himself actually trusts in his own righteousness and does injustice, + all his own righteous acts will not be remembered, but for his injustice that he has done—for this he will die. + 14 “‘And when I say to the wicked one: “You will positively die,” + and he actually turns back from his sin + and carries on justice and righteousness, + 15 [and] the wicked one returns the very thing pledged, + pays back the very things taken by robbery, + [and] actually walks in the very statutes of life by not doing injustice, + he will positively keep living. + He will not die. 16 None of his sins with which he has sinned will be remembered against him. + Justice and righteousness are what he has carried on. He will positively keep living.’ + 17 “And the sons of your people have said, ‘The way of Jehovah * is not adjusted right,’ + but, as for them, it is their way that is not adjusted right. 18 “When someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and actually does injustice, he must also die for them. + 19 And when someone wicked turns back from his wickedness and actually carries on justice and righteousness, it will be on account of them that he himself will keep living. + 20 “And YOU people have said, ‘The way of Jehovah * is not adjusted right.’ + It will be each one according to his ways that I shall judge YOU , + O house of Israel.” 21 At length it occurred in the twelfth year, in the tenth [month], on the fifth day of the month of our exile, that there came to me the escaped one from Jerusalem, + saying: “The city has been struck down!” + 22 Now the very hand of Jehovah had come to be upon me in the evening before the coming of the escaped one, + and He proceeded to open my mouth prior to [that one’s] coming to me in the morning, and my mouth was opened and I proved to be speechless no longer. + 23 And the word of Jehovah began to occur to me, saying: 24 “Son of man, the inhabitants of these devastated places + are saying even concerning the soil of Israel, ‘Abraham happened to be just one and yet he took possession of the land. + And we are many; to us the land has been given as something to possess.’ + 25 “Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “With * the blood YOU keep eating, + and YOUR eyes YOU keep lifting to YOUR dungy idols, + and blood YOU keep pouring out. + So should YOU possess the land? + 26 Y OU have depended * upon YOUR sword. + Y OU * have done a detestable thing, + and YOU have defiled each one the wife of his companion. + So should YOU possess the land?”’ + 27 “This is what you should say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “As I am alive, surely the ones who are in the devastated places will fall by the sword itself; + and the one who is upon the surface of the field, to the wild beast I shall certainly give him for food; + and those who are in the strong places and in the caves + will die by the pestilence itself. 28 And I shall actually make the land a desolate waste, + even a desolation, and the pride of its strength must be made to cease + and the mountains of Israel must be laid desolate, + with no one passing through. 29 And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I make the land a desolate waste, + even a desolation, on account of all their detestable things that they have done.”’ + 30 “And as for you, O son of man, the sons of your people are speaking with one another about you beside the walls and in the entrances of the houses, + and the one has spoken with the other, each one with his brother, saying, ‘C OME , please, and hear what the word is that is going forth from Jehovah.’ + 31 And they will come in to you, like the coming in of people, and sit before you as my people; + and they will certainly hear your words but these they will not do, + for with their mouth they are expressing lustful desires [and] after their unjust gain is where their heart is going. + 32 And, look! you are to them like a song of sensuous loves, like one with a pretty voice and playing a stringed instrument well. + And they will certainly hear your words, but there are none doing them. + 33 And when it comes true—look! it must come true + —they will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “as their lookout .” Heb., la·hemʹ le tso·phehʹ . ^ Or, “and the people of the land actually take a man [Heb., ʼish ], one from their borders.” ^ “The people of the land .” Heb., ʽam- ha· ʼaʹrets .
