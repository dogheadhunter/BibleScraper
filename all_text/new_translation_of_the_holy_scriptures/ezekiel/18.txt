All the souls * —to me they belong. + As the soul + of the father so likewise the soul of the son—to me they belong. + The soul that is sinning + —it itself will die. * + 5 “‘And as regards a man, * in case he happens to be righteous and he has executed justice and righteousness; + 6 on the mountains + he did not eat + and his eyes he did not raise to the dungy idols of the house of Israel, + and his companion’s wife he did not defile + and to a woman in her impurity he would not go near; + 7 and no man would he maltreat; + the pledge that he took for indebtedness, he would return; + nothing would he wrest away in robbery; + to the hungry one he would give his own bread + and the naked one he would cover with a garment; + 8 nothing would he give on interest + and no usury would he take; + from injustice he would draw back his hand; + true justice he would execute between man and man; + 9 in my statutes he kept walking + and my judicial decisions he kept in order to execute truth, + he is righteous. + He will positively keep living,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 10 “‘And [if] one has become father to a son who is a robber, + a shedder of blood, + who has done the like of one of these things * 11 (but he himself has done none of these very things); in case he has eaten also upon the mountains, + and his companion’s wife he has defiled; + 12 the afflicted and poor one he has maltreated; + things he has wrested away in robbery, + a pledged thing he would not return; + and to the dungy idols he lifted up his eyes, + a detestable thing is what he has done. + 13 On usury he has given, + and interest he has taken, + and he positively will not keep living. All these detestable things he has done. + He will positively be put to death. On him his own blood will come to be. + 14 “‘And, look! one has become father to a son, who keeps seeing all the sins of his father that he has done, and he sees * and does not do things like them. + 15 On the mountains he has not eaten, and his eyes he has not lifted up to the dungy idols of the house of Israel; + his companion’s wife he has not defiled; + 16 and no man * has he maltreated, + no pledge has he seized, + and nothing has he taken in robbery; + to the hungry one he has given his own bread, + and the naked one he has covered with a garment; + 17 from the afflicted one * he has drawn back his hand; no usury + and interest + has he taken; my judicial decisions he has carried out; + in my statutes he has walked; + he himself will not die because of the error of his father. + He will positively keep living. + 18 As for his father, because he committed outright defrauding, + wrested something away in robbery of a brother, + and whatever is not good he has done in the midst of his peoples, + look! then he must die for his error. + 19 “‘And YOU people will certainly say: “Why is it that the son does not have to bear anything because of the error of the father?” + Now as regards the son, justice and righteousness he has executed, + all the statutes of mine he has kept and he keeps doing them. + He will positively keep living. + 20 The soul that is sinning—it itself will die. * + A son himself will bear nothing because of the error of the father, and a father himself will bear nothing because of the error of the son. + Upon his own self the very righteousness of the righteous one will come to be, + and upon his own self the very wickedness of a wicked one will come to be. + 21 “‘Now as regards someone wicked, in case he should turn back from all his sins that he has committed + and he should actually keep all my statutes and execute justice and righteousness, + he will positively keep living. He will not die. + 22 All his transgressions that he has committed—they will not be remembered against him. + For his righteousness that he has done he will keep living.’ + 23 “‘Do I take any delight at all in the death of someone wicked,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘[and] not in that he should turn back from his ways and actually keep living?’ + 24 “‘Now when someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and actually does injustice; + according to all the detestable things that the wicked one has done he keeps doing + and he is living, none of all his righteous acts that he has done will be remembered. + For his unfaithfulness that he has committed and for his sin with which he has sinned, for them he will die. + 25 “‘And YOU people will certainly say: “The way of Jehovah * is not adjusted right.” + Hear, please, O house of Israel. Is not my own way adjusted right? + Are not the ways of YOU people not adjusted right? + 26 “‘When someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and he actually does injustice + and dies on account of them, for his injustice that he has done he will die. + 27 “‘And when someone wicked turns back from his wickedness that he has committed and proceeds to execute justice and righteousness, + he is the one that will preserve his own soul alive. + 28 When he sees * + and he turns back from all his transgressions that he has done, + he will positively keep living. He will not die. + 29 “‘And the house of Israel will certainly say: “The way of Jehovah * is not adjusted right.” + As for my ways, are they not adjusted right, O house of Israel? + Are not the ways of YOU people the ones that are not adjusted right?’ + 30 “‘Therefore each one according to his ways is how I shall judge YOU , + O house of Israel,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. + ‘Turn back, yes, cause a turning back from all YOUR transgressions, + and let nothing prove to be for YOU people a stumbling block causing error. + 31 Throw off from yourselves all YOUR transgressions in which YOU have transgressed + and make for yourselves a new heart + and a new spirit, + for why should YOU die, + O house of Israel?’ 32 “‘For I do not take any delight in the death of someone dying,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. ‘So cause a turning back and keep living, + O YOU people.’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “get blunted (dulled).” ^ “The souls .” Heb., han· nepha·shohthʹ ; Gr., psy·khaiʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mae .
