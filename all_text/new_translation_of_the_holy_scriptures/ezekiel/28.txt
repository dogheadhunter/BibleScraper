In the day of your being created they were made ready. 14 You are the * anointed cherub * that is covering, and I have set * you. * On the holy mountain of God * you proved to be. + In the midst of fiery stones * you walked about. 15 You were faultless in your ways from the day of your being created + until unrighteousness was found in you. + 16 “‘“Because of the abundance of your sales goods + they filled the midst of you * with violence, and you began to sin. + And I shall put you as profane out of the mountain of God, * and I shall destroy you, + O cherub that is covering, * from the midst of the fiery stones. * 17 “‘“Your heart became haughty because of your beauty. + You brought your wisdom to ruin on account of your beaming splendor. + Onto the earth I will throw you. + Before kings I will set you, [for them] to look upon you. + 18 “‘“Owing to the abundance of your errors, + because of the injustice of your sales goods, + you have profaned * your sanctuaries. And I shall bring forth a fire from the midst of you. It is what must devour you. + And I shall make you ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all those seeing you. + 19 As for all those knowing you among the peoples, they will certainly stare in amazement at you. + Sudden terrors are what you must become, and you will be no more to time indefinite.”’” + 20 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: 21 “Son of man, set your face toward Siʹdon, + and prophesy against her. 22 And you must say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am against you, + O Siʹdon, and I shall certainly be glorified in the midst of you; + and people will have to know that I am Jehovah when I execute acts of judgment + in her and I am actually sanctified in her. + 23 And I will send pestilence into her and blood into her streets. + And the slain one must fall in the midst of her by the sword against her on every side; + and people will have to know that I am Jehovah. + 24 And no more will there prove to be to the house of Israel a malignant prickle + or a painful thorn out of all those round about them, those who are treating them with scorn; and people will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’ 25 “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “When I collect together the house of Israel out from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, + I will also be sanctified among them in the eyes of the nations. + And they will certainly dwell upon their soil + that I gave to my servant, to Jacob. + 26 And they will actually dwell upon it in security + and build houses + and plant vineyards, + and they must dwell in security + when I execute acts of judgment upon all those treating them with scorn all round about them; + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah their God.”’” * Footnotes ^ “A god (divine one).” Heb., ʼel; Gr., the·osʹ; Lat., deʹus . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼelo·himʹ; Lat., deʹi . ^ Or, “a human.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ; Gr., anʹthro·pos; Lat., hoʹmo . ^ “Chrysolite,” Vg; Heb., tar·shishʹ . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Gr., The·ouʹ; Lat., Deʹi . ^ “Garden.” Heb., gan; Gr., pa·ra·deiʹsou; Syr., par·dai·seh; Lat., pa·ra·diʹsi . ^ Lit., “stones of fire.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Lat., Deʹi . ^ “You are the anointed king in the kingdom, and I have given you greatness,” T; LXX, “With the cherub I set you”; Sy, “You happened to be with the anointed cherub that is covering, and I set you”; Vg, “You are the cherub stretched out and protecting, and I set you.” ^ Lit., “cherub of an anointing [possibly, expansion].” Heb., keruvʹ mim·shachʹ . ^ “You are the,” MTVg; by a different vowel pointing, “With the,” in agreement with LXXSy and Arabic. ^ Lit., “given.” ^ “They filled the midst of you,” M; Sy, “you filled your own midst”; T, “your storehouses were filled”; LXX, “you filled your storehouses”; Vg, “your inner parts were filled.” ^ Lit., “stones of fire.” ^ “I shall destroy you, O cherub that is covering,” MSy; Vg, “I have destroyed you, O protecting cherub”; LXX, “the cherub led you away.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Gr., The·ouʹ; Lat., Deʹi . ^ “You have profaned,” MSyVg; LXX B , “I have profaned.” ^ Or, “I, Jehovah , am their God .” Heb., ʼaniʹ Yehwahʹ ʼElo·h eh·hemʹ .
