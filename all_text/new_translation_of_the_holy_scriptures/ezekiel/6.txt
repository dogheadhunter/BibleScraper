I am bringing upon YOU a sword, and I shall certainly destroy YOUR high places. + 4 And YOUR altars must be made desolate + and YOUR incense stands must be broken, and I will cause YOUR slain ones to fall before YOUR dungy idols. + 5 And I will put the carcasses of the sons of Israel before their dungy idols, and I will scatter YOUR bones all around YOUR altars. + 6 In all YOUR dwelling places + the very cities will become devastated + and the high places themselves will become desolated, in order that they may lie devastated + and YOUR altars may lie desolated and be actually broken + and YOUR dungy idols may be actually made to cease + and YOUR incense stands cut down + and YOUR works wiped out. 7 And the slain one will certainly fall in the midst of YOU , + and YOU will have to know that I am Jehovah. * + 8 “‘“And when it occurs I will let YOU have as a remnant the ones escaping from the sword among the nations, when YOU get scattered among the lands. + 9 And YOUR escaped ones will certainly remember me among the nations to which they will have been taken captive, + because I have been broken up at their fornicating heart that has turned aside from me + and at their eyes that are going in fornication after their dungy idols; + and they will certainly feel a loathing in their faces at the bad things that they have done in all their detestable things. + 10 And they will have to know that I am Jehovah; not in vain did I speak + about doing to them this calamitous thing.”’ + 11 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Clap your hands + and stamp with your foot, and say: “Alas!” on account of all the bad detestable things of the house of Israel, + because by the sword, + by the famine + and by the pestilence they will fall. + 12 As for the one far away, + by the pestilence he will die; and as for the one that is nearby, by the sword he will fall; and as for the one that has been left remaining and that has been safeguarded, by the famine he will die, and I will bring to its finish my rage against them. + 13 And YOU people will have to know that I am Jehovah, + when their slain ones come to be in the midst of their dungy idols, + all around their altars, + upon every high hill, + on all the tops of the mountains + and under every luxuriant tree + and under every branchy big tree, + the place where they have offered a restful * odor to all their dungy idols. + 14 And I will stretch out my hand against them + and make the land a desolate waste, even a desolation worse than the wilderness toward Dibʹlah, * in all their dwelling places. And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” Footnotes ^ “And you will have to know that I am Jehovah.” Heb., wi·dhaʽ·temʹ ki-ʼaniʹ Yehwahʹ . The first of more than 60 occurrences of this phrase in Ezekiel, referring to the vindication of Jehovah’s name on earth. ^ Or, “soothing; tranquilizing; appeasing.” ^ “Diblah,” MLXXVg; one Heb. ms, “Riblah.” Previous Next Print Share Share
