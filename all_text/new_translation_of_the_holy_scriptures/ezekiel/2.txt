Of their words do not you be afraid, + and at their faces do not you be struck with terror, + for they are a rebellious house. + 7 And you must speak my words to them, regardless of whether they hear or they refrain, for they are a case of rebellion. + 8 “And you, O son of man, hear what I am speaking to you. Do not become rebellious like the rebellious house. + Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.” + 9 And I began to see, and, look! there was a hand thrust out to me, + and, look! in it there was the roll of a book. + 10 And he gradually spread it out before me, and it was written upon in front and on the back; + and there were written in it dirges and moaning and wailing. + Footnotes ^ “Son of man.” Heb., ben-ʼa·dhamʹ; the first of 93 occurrences of this expression in Ezekiel.
