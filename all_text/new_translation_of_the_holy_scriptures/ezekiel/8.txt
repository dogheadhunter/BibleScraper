For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. * + Jehovah has left the land.’” * 13 And he continued on to say to me: “You will yet see again great detestable things that they are doing.” + 14 So he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, which is toward the north, and, look! there the women were sitting, weeping over the [god] Tamʹmuz. * 15 And he further said to me: “Have you seen [this], O son of man? You will yet see again great detestable + things worse than these.” 16 So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah, + and, look! at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, + there were about twenty-five men * + with their backs to the temple * of Jehovah + and their faces to the east, and they were bowing down to the east, to the sun. + 17 And he went on to say to me: “Have you seen [this], O son of man? Is it such a light thing to the house of Judah to do the detestable things that they have done here, that they have to fill the land * with violence + and that they should offend me again, and here they are thrusting out the shoot * to my nose? * 18 And I myself also shall act in rage. + My eye will not feel sorry, neither shall I feel compassion. + And they will certainly call out in my ears with a loud voice, but I shall not hear them.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “elders.” ^ See 1:4 ftn, “Electrum.” ^ “A spirit.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma; Lat., spiʹri·tus .
