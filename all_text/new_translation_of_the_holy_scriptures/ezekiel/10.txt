They would not change direction when they went, because the place to which the head would face, after it they would go. They would not change direction when they went. + 12 And all their flesh and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around. + The four of them had their wheels. 13 As regards the wheels, to them it was called out in my ears, “O wheelwork!” 14 And [each] one had four faces. + The first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of earthling man, * + and the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. + 15 And the cherubs would rise + —it was the [same] living creature that I had seen at the river Cheʹbar + — 16 and when the cherubs went, the wheels would go alongside them; + and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not change direction, even they themselves, from alongside them. + 17 When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, + they would rise with them, for the spirit of the living creature * was in them. + 18 And the glory + of Jehovah proceeded to go forth from over the threshold of the house and to stand still over the cherubs. + 19 And the cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth + before my eyes. When they went forth, the wheels also were close alongside them; and they began standing at the eastern entrance of the gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them, from above. 20 This is the living creature + that I had seen under the God of Israel * at the river Cheʹbar, + so that I came to know that they were cherubs. 21 As for the four, [each] one had four faces + and [each] one had four wings, and the likeness of the hands of earthling man * was under their wings. 22 And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces the appearance of which I had seen by the river Cheʹbar, the very ones. + They would go each one straight forward. + Footnotes ^ “Cher­ubs,” LXXVg c .
