A flooding downpour will certainly occur, and YOU , O hailstones, will fall, * and a blast * of windstorms itself will cause a splitting. + 12 And, look! the wall must fall. Will it not be said to YOU men, ‘Where is the coating * with which YOU did the plastering?’ + 13 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘I will also cause a blast of windstorms to burst forth in my rage, and in my anger there will occur a flooding downpour, and in rage there will be hailstones for an extermination. + 14 And I will tear down the wall that YOU men have plastered with whitewash and bring it into contact with the earth, and its foundation must be exposed. + And she * will certainly fall, and YOU must come to an end in the midst of her; and YOU will have to know that I am Jehovah.’ + 15 “‘And I will bring my rage to its finish upon the wall and upon those plastering it with whitewash, and I shall say to YOU men: “The wall is no more, and those plastering it are no more, + 16 the prophets of Israel that are prophesying to Jerusalem and that are visioning for her a vision of peace, + when there is no peace,”’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. + 17 “And as for you, O son of man, set your face + against the daughters of your people who are acting as prophetesses + out of their own heart, + and prophesy against them. 18 And you must say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Woe to the women sewing bands together upon all elbows * and making veils upon the head of every size in order to hunt souls! * + Are the souls that YOU women hunt down the ones belonging to my people, and the souls belonging to YOU the ones that YOU preserve alive? 19 And will YOU profane me toward my people for the handfuls of barley and for the morsels of bread, + in order to put to death the souls that ought not to die + and in order to preserve alive the souls that ought not to live by YOUR lie to my people, the hearers of a lie?”’ + 20 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am against the bands of YOU women, with which YOU are hunting down the souls as though they were flying things, * and I will rip them from off YOUR arms and let go * the souls that YOU are hunting down, souls * as though they were flying things. + 21 And I will rip away YOUR veils and deliver my people out of YOUR hand, and they will no more prove to be in YOUR hand something caught in the hunt; and YOU will have to know that I am Jehovah. + 22 By reason of dejecting the heart of a righteous one with falsehood, + when I myself had not caused him pain, and for making the hands of a wicked one strong + so that he would not turn back from his bad way in order to preserve him alive, + 23 therefore untruth YOU women will not keep on visioning, + and divination + YOU will divine + no longer; + and I will deliver my people out of YOUR hand, + and YOU will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” + Footnotes ^ “Their own spirit .” Heb., ru·ch amʹ; Lat., spiʹri·tum ; Gr., kar·diʹas, “heart.” ^ Or, “war.” ^ “You people,” MTSyVg; LXX, “they.” ^ Lit., “writing.” ^ According to M; LXX, “and I shall give hurling-stones against their bondings, and they will fall”; Vg, “and I shall give very large stones rushing from above.” ^ “And a blast of.” Heb., we ruʹach ; Gr., pneuʹma ; Lat., venʹtum , “wind.” ^ Or, “plaster.” ^ Or, “it,” fem. sing.; not referring to the “wall,” masc., but possibly to the city. ^ Lit., “the joints of hands.” ^ “Souls.” Heb., nepha·shohthʹ, fem. pl.; Gr., psy·khasʹ; Lat., aʹni·mas . ^ Or, “as though flies.” ^ Lit., “and send away.” ^ “Souls.” Heb., nepha·shimʹ, masc., pl. of neʹphesh, fem.
