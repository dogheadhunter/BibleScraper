And they must draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. + 12 And I will make the Nile canals + dry ground and will sell the land into the hand of bad men, + and I will cause the land and its fullness to be desolated by the hand of strangers. + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken.’ + 13 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘I will also destroy the dungy idols + and cause the valueless gods to cease out of Noph, * + and there will no more prove to be a chieftain out of the land of Egypt; and I shall certainly put fear in the land of Egypt. + 14 And I will bring Pathʹros + to desolation and set a fire in Zoʹan + and execute acts of judgment in No. * + 15 And I will pour out my rage + upon Sin, * the fortress of Egypt, and cut off the crowd of No. + 16 And I will set a fire in Egypt. Sin will without fail be in severe pains, and No itself will come to be for capture by breaches; and as regards Noph—there will be adversaries during the daytime! 17 As for the young men of On * + and Pi·beʹseth, by the sword they will fall, and into captivity the [cities] themselves will go. 18 And in Te·haphʹne·hes + the day will actually grow dark, when I break there the yoke bars of Egypt. + And in her the pride of her strength will actually be made to cease. + As for her, clouds themselves will cover her, + and into captivity her own dependent towns * will go. + 19 And I will execute acts of judgment in Egypt; + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” 20 And it occurred further that in the eleventh year, in the first [month], on the seventh [day] of the month, the word of Jehovah occurred to me, saying: 21 “Son of man, the arm of Pharʹaoh the king of Egypt I shall certainly break, + and, look! it will not be bound up at all in order to give [it] healing by putting a bandage on for binding it up, + for it to become strong to take hold of the sword.” 22 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am against Pharʹaoh the king of Egypt, + and I will break his arms, + the strong one and the broken one, + and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. + 23 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands. + 24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon + and give my sword into his hand, + and I will break the arms of Pharʹaoh, and as a deadly wounded one he will certainly do a great deal of groaning before him. + 25 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the very arms of Pharʹaoh will fall; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he actually extends it out against the land of Egypt. + 26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations + and disperse them among the lands; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” Footnotes ^ “Ethiopia,” LXXVg; MTSy, “Cush.” ^ “Mixed company,” MLXX; Sy, “Arabians.” ^ Or, “Aswān.” Heb., Sewe·nehʹ . ^ “In the ships,” M; Lat., in tri·eʹri·bus, “in triremes”; LXXSy, “hastening.” ^ “Noph,” M; LXXSyVg, “Memphis.” ^ “No,” MSy; TVg, “Alexandria.” ^ “Sin,” MTSy; Vg, “Pelusium.” ^ Lit., “Aven,” M; LXXVg, “Heliopolis.” ^ Lit., “her daughters.” Previous Next Print Share Share
