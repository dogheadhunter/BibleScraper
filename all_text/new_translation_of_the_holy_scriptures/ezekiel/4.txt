It is a sign to the house of Israel. + 4 “And as for you, lie upon your left side, and you must lay the error of the house of Israel upon it. + For the number of the days that you will lie upon it you will carry their error. 5 And I myself must give to you the years of their error + to the number of three hundred and ninety days, + and you must carry the error of the house of Israel. 6 And you must complete them. “And you must lie upon your right side in the second case, and you must carry the error of the house of Judah forty days. + A day for a year, a day for a year, is what I have given you. + 7 And to the siege of Jerusalem you will fix your face, + with your arm bared, and you must prophesy against it. 8 “And, look! I will put cords + upon you that you may not turn yourself from your one side to your other side, until you will have completed the days of your siege. 9 “And as for you, take for yourself wheat + and barley and broad beans + and lentils + and millet and spelt, + and you must put them in one utensil and make them into bread * for you, for the number of the days that you are lying upon your side; three hundred and ninety days you will eat it. + 10 And your food that you will eat will be by weight—twenty shekels a day. + From time to time you will eat it. 11 “And water you will drink merely by measure, the sixth part of a hin. * From time to time you will drink. 12 “And as a round cake of barley + you will eat it; and as for it, upon dung cakes of the excrement + of mankind * you will bake it before their eyes.” 13 And Jehovah went on to say: “Just like this the sons of Israel will eat their bread unclean + among the nations to which I shall disperse them.” + 14 And I proceeded to say: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Look! My soul is not a defiled one; + neither a body [already] dead nor a torn animal have I eaten from my youth up, + even until now, and into my mouth there has come no foul flesh.” + 15 Accordingly he said to me: “See, I have given you cattle manure instead of the dung cakes of mankind, and you must make your bread upon it.” 16 And he continued saying to me: “Son of man, here I am breaking the rods around which ring-shaped loaves are suspended, * + in Jerusalem, and they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, + and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, + 17 to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water and they may look astonished at one another and rot away in their error. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “pour out.” ^ Or, “food.” ^ A hin equaled 3.67 L (7.75 pt). ^ Lit., “the earthling man .” Heb., ha· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “the rod of bread.” Previous Next Print Share Share
