But as regards breath, there was none in them. 9 And he went on saying to me: “Prophesy to the wind. * Prophesy, O son of man, and you must say to the wind, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “From the four winds come in, O wind, and blow upon these killed + people, that they may come to life.”’” + 10 And I prophesied just as he had commanded me, and the breath proceeded to come into them, and they began to live and stand upon their feet, + a very, very great military force. 11 And he went on to say to me: “Son of man, as regards these bones, they are the whole house of Israel. + Here they are saying, ‘Our bones have become dry, and our hope has perished. + We have been severed off to ourselves.’ 12 Therefore prophesy, and you must say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am opening YOUR burial places, + and I will bring YOU up out of YOUR burial places, O my people, and bring YOU in upon the soil of Israel. + 13 And YOU will have to know that I am Jehovah when I open YOUR burial places and when I bring YOU up out of YOUR burial places, O my people.”’ + 14 ‘And I will put my spirit * in YOU , and YOU must come to life, + and I will settle YOU upon YOUR soil; and YOU will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have spoken and I have done [it],’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” + 15 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: 16 “And as for you, O son of man, take for yourself a stick + and write upon it, ‘For Judah and for the sons of Israel his partners.’ * + And take another stick and write upon it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Eʹphra·im, + and all the house of Israel his partners.’ + 17 And cause them to approach each other into one stick for yourself, and they will actually become just one in your hand. + 18 And when the sons of your people begin to say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what these things mean to you?’ + 19 speak to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am taking the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Eʹphra·im, and the tribes of Israel his partners, and I will put them upon it, that is, * the stick of Judah, and I shall actually make them one stick, + and they must become one in my hand.”’ 20 And the sticks upon which you write must prove to be in your hand before their eyes. + 21 “And speak to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am taking the sons of Israel from among the nations to which they have gone, and I will collect them together from round about and bring them onto their soil. + 22 And I shall actually make them one nation in the land, + on the mountains of Israel, and one king is what all of them will come to have as king, + and they will no longer continue to be two nations, nor will they be divided any longer into two kingdoms. + 23 And they will no longer defile themselves with their dungy idols and with their disgusting things and with all their transgressions; + and I shall certainly save them from all their dwelling places * in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, + and they must become my people, and I myself shall become their God. * + 24 “‘“And my servant David will be king over them, + and one shepherd is what they will all come to have; + and in my judicial decisions they will walk, + and my statutes they will keep, + and they will certainly carry them out. + 25 And they will actually dwell upon the land that I gave to my servant, to Jacob, in which YOUR forefathers dwelt, + and they will actually dwell upon it, + they and their sons and their sons’ sons to time indefinite, + and David my servant will be their chieftain * to time indefinite. + 26 “‘“And I will conclude with them a covenant of peace; + an indefinitely lasting covenant is what there will come to be with them. + And I will place them and multiply them + and place my sanctuary in the midst of them to time indefinite. + 27 And my tabernacle will actually prove to be over them, + and I shall certainly become their God, and they themselves will become my people. + 28 And the nations will have to know that I, Jehovah, + am sanctifying Israel when my sanctuary comes to be in the midst of them to time indefinite.”’” + Footnotes ^ “In the spirit of.” Heb., ve ruʹach .
