To us they have been given for food.” + 13 And YOU people kept acting in great style against me with YOUR mouths, * + and YOU have multiplied against me YOUR words. + I myself have heard [them].’ + 14 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘At the same time that all the earth rejoices, a desolate waste is what I shall make of you. 15 Just as there was rejoicing on your part at the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was laid desolate, the same thing I shall make of you. + A desolate waste is what you will become, O mountainous region of Seʹir, even all Eʹdom, all of it; + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “hands.” ^ Lit., “the time of the error of [the] end.” ^ Or, “Since blood you did not hate, blood itself also will.” ^ “Among them,” MTSyVg; LXX, “to you.” ^ “They have,” M margin ; MT, “She has.” ^ Or, “you people maintain a big mouth against me.” Previous Next Print Share Share
