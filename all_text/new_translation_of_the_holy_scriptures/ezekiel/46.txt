No one should go back by the way of the gate by which he came in, for he * should go out straight ahead of him. 10 And as regards the chieftain in their midst, when they come in, he should come in; and when they go out, he * should go out. + 11 And in the festivals + and in the festal seasons the grain offering should prove to be an eʹphah for the young bull and an eʹphah for the ram, and for the male lambs as he is able to give; * and, as regards oil, a hin to the eʹphah. + 12 “‘And in case the chieftain should provide as a voluntary offering a whole burnt offering, + or communion sacrifices as a voluntary offering to Jehovah, one must also open to him the gate that is facing east, + and he must provide his whole burnt offering and his communion sacrifices just as he does on the sabbath day. + And he must go out, and one must shut the gate after his going out. + 13 “‘And a sound male lamb, in its first year, * you * should provide as a whole burnt offering daily to Jehovah. + Morning by morning you * should provide it. 14 And as a grain offering you * should provide with it morning by morning the sixth of an eʹphah and, as regards oil, the third of a hin for sprinkling the fine flour. + The grain offering to Jehovah is an indefinitely lasting statute, constantly. 15 And they must provide the male lamb and the grain offering and the oil morning by morning as a constant * whole burnt offering.’ 16 “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘In case the chieftain should give a gift to each one * of his sons as his inheritance, it itself will become the property of his sons themselves. It is their possession by inheritance. 17 And in case he should give a gift from his inheritance to one * of his servants, * it must also become his until the year of liberty; * + and it must return to the chieftain. Only his inheritance—as regards his sons * —is what should continue to belong to their own selves. 18 And the chieftain should not take any of the inheritance of the people so as to force them out of their possession. + From his own possession he should give his sons an inheritance, to the end that my people may not be scattered each one from his possession.’” + 19 And he proceeded to bring me in by the entryway + that was by the side of the gate to the holy dining rooms, those belonging to the priests, that were facing to the north, + and, look! there was a place there on both rear sides * to the west. 20 And he proceeded to say to me: “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering + and the sin offering, + [and] where they will bake the grain offering, + in order to carry nothing out to the outer courtyard so as to sanctify the people.” + 21 And he proceeded to bring me out to the outer courtyard and make me pass along to the four corner posts of the courtyard, and, look! there was a courtyard by [this] corner post of the courtyard, a courtyard by [that] corner post of the courtyard. 22 At the four corner posts of the courtyard there were small courtyards, forty [cubits] in length and thirty in width. The four of them with corner structures * had the same measurement. 23 And there was a row round about them, round about the four of them, and there were boiling places + made beneath the rows round about. 24 Then he said to me: “These are the houses of those doing the boiling, where the ministers of the House boil the sacrifice of the people.” + Footnotes ^ See 7:27 ftn. ^ Lit., “as the gift of his hand.” ^ Lit., “what his hand may attain to (may reach).” See Le 5:7 ftn, “Afford.” ^ “He,” M margin TLXXSyVg and over 100 Heb. mss; M, “they.” ^ “He,” TLXXSyVg and 37 Heb. mss; M, “they.” ^ See vs 5 ftn. ^ Lit., “male lamb, a son of its year.” See Le 12:6; 14:10 . ^ “You,” MT; LXXSyVg and some Heb. mss, “he.” ^ “You,” MT; LXXVg, “he.” ^ “You,” MT; LXXSyVg and two Heb. mss, “he.” ^ Or, “continual.” Heb., ta·midhʹ .
