And they must become my people and I myself shall become their God,’ * is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” + 12 And the word of Jehovah continued to come to me, saying: 13 “Son of man, as regards a land, in case it commits sin against me in acting unfaithfully, + I will also stretch out my hand against it and break for it the rods around which ring-shaped loaves are suspended, * + and I will send upon it famine + and cut off from it earthling man and domestic animal.” + 14 “‘And had these three men * proved to be in the midst of it, Noah, + Daniel + and Job, + they themselves because of their righteousness + would deliver their soul,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” + 15 “‘Or if I should make injurious wild beasts pass through the land + and they actually bereaved it of children + and it actually became a desolate waste without anybody passing through on account of the wild beasts, + 16 were these three men in the midst of it, as I am alive,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘neither sons nor daughters would they deliver; they, only they themselves, would be delivered and the land itself would become a desolate waste.’” + 17 “‘Or were it a sword that I should bring upon that land, + and should I actually say: “Let a sword itself pass through the land,” and should I actually cut off from it earthling man * and domestic animal, + 18 even were these three men in the midst of it, + as I am alive,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they, only they themselves, would be delivered.’” + 19 “‘Or were it pestilence that I should send * upon that land + and should I actually pour out my rage upon it with blood, + in order to cut off from it earthling man and domestic animal, 20 even were Noah, + Daniel + and Job + in the midst of it, + as I am alive,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘neither son nor daughter would they deliver; they themselves because of their righteousness would deliver their soul.’” + 21 “For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘So, too, [it will be] when there will be my four injurious acts of judgment + —sword and famine and injurious wild beast and pestilence + —that I shall actually send upon Jerusalem in order to cut off from it earthling man and domestic animal. + 22 But, look! there will certainly be left remaining in it an escaped company, those being brought forth. + Sons and daughters, here they are! They are going forth to YOU people, and YOU will have to see their way and their dealings. + And YOU will certainly be comforted over the calamity that I shall have brought upon Jerusalem, even all that I shall have brought upon her.’” 23 “‘And they will certainly comfort YOU people when YOU see their way and their dealings; and YOU will have to know that it was not without cause that I shall have done all that I must do against * her,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” + Footnotes ^ “Men.” Heb., ʼana·shimʹ, pl. of ʼish . ^ “Any man at all.” Heb., ʼish ʼish . ^ “Against that man .” Heb., ba· ʼishʹ ha·huʼʹ . ^ Lit., “to them for God .” Heb., la·hemʹ l Eʼ·lo·himʹ . ^ Lit., “the staff of bread.” ^ Lit., “the men .” Heb., ha· ʼana·shimʹ , pl. of ʼish . ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “let go.” ^ Or, “in.” Previous Next Print Share Share
