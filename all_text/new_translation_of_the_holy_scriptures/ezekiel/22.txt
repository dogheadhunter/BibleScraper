That is why I must make you an object of reproach to the nations and of jeering to all the lands. + 5 The [lands] nearby and those far away from you will jeer you, O you unclean in name, abounding in confusion. + 6 Look! The chieftains + of Israel have proved to be in you, each one [given over] to his arm for the purpose of shedding blood. + 7 Father and mother they have treated with contempt in you. + Toward the alien resident they have acted with defrauding in the midst of you. + Fatherless boy and widow they have maltreated in you.”’” + 8 “‘My holy places you have despised, and my sabbaths you have profaned. + 9 Outright slanderers * have proved to be in you, for the purpose of shedding blood; + and on the mountains they have eaten in you. + Loose conduct they have carried on in the midst of you. + 10 The nakedness of a father they have uncovered * in you; + a woman unclean in [her] menstruation they have humiliated in you. + 11 And with the wife of his companion a man has done a detestable thing, + and his own daughter-in-law a man has defiled with loose conduct; + and his sister, the daughter of his own father, a man has humiliated in you. + 12 A bribe they have taken in you for the purpose of shedding blood. + Interest + and usury you have taken, + and you violently keep making gain + of your companions with defrauding, + and me you have forgotten,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. 13 “‘And, look! I have struck my hand + at your unjust gain that you have made, + and over your acts of bloodshed * that have proved to be in the midst of you. + 14 Will your heart keep enduring + or your hands furnish strength in the days when I am taking action toward you? + I myself, Jehovah, have spoken and I will take action. + 15 And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands, + and I will destroy * your uncleanness * out of you. + 16 And you will certainly be profaned within yourself before the eyes of [the] nations, and you will have to know that I am Jehovah.’” + 17 And the word of Jehovah continued to come to me, saying: 18 “Son of man, to me those of the house of Israel have become as scummy dross. + All of them are copper and tin and iron and lead in the midst of a furnace. Much scummy dross, [that of] silver, they have become. + 19 “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘For the reason that all of YOU have become as much scummy dross, + therefore here I am collecting YOU together into the midst of Jerusalem. + 20 As in collecting silver and copper and iron + and lead and tin into the midst of a furnace, in order to blow + upon it with fire to cause a liquefying, + so I shall collect [them] together in my anger and in my rage, and I will blow * and cause YOU people to liquefy. 21 And I will bring YOU together and blow upon YOU with the fire of my fury, + and YOU must be liquefied in the midst of her. * + 22 As in the liquefying of silver in the midst of a furnace, so YOU people will be liquefied in the midst of her; and YOU will have to know that I myself, Jehovah, have poured out my rage upon YOU .’” + 23 And the word of Jehovah continued to come to me, saying: 24 “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land not being cleansed, one not rained down upon in the day of denunciation. + 25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her, + like the roaring lion, tearing prey. + A soul they actually devour. + Treasure and precious things they keep taking. + Her widows they have multiplied in the midst of her. + 26 Her priests themselves have done violence to my law, + and they keep profaning my holy places. + Between the holy thing and the common * + they have made no distinction, + and between the unclean thing and the clean they have made nothing known, + and from my sabbaths they have hidden their eyes, + and I am profaned in the midst of them. + 27 Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves tearing prey in shedding blood, + in destroying souls * for the purpose of making unjust gain. + 28 And her prophets have plastered for them with whitewash, + visioning an unreality + and divining for them a lie, + saying: “This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said,” when Jehovah himself has not spoken. 29 The people of the land themselves have carried on a scheme of defrauding + and have done a tearing away in robbery, + and the afflicted one and the poor one they have maltreated, + and the alien resident they have defrauded without justice.’ + 30 “‘And I kept looking for a man * from among them who would be repairing the stone wall + and standing in the gap + before me in behalf of the land, in order [for me] not to bring it to ruin; + and I found no one. 31 So I shall pour out my denunciation + upon them. With the fire of my fury I will exterminate them. + Their way I will bring upon their own head,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “the city of the bloods.” ^ Lit., “ men of slander.” Heb., ʼan·shehʹ ra·khilʹ . ^ Lit., “one [or, he] has uncovered.” ^ Lit., “your blood,” sing. but the subject of a pl. verb. ^ Lit., “terminate.” ^ “Your uncleanness .” Heb., tum·ʼa·th ekhʹ; Gr., a·ka·thar·siʹa .
