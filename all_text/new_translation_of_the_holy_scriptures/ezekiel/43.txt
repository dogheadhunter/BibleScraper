On the top of the mountain its entire territory all around is something most holy. + Look! This is the law of the House. 13 “And these are the measurements of the altar in cubits, + a cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. * + And [its] bottom * is a cubit. And a cubit is the width. And its border is upon its lip round about, one span. And this is the base of the altar. 14 And from the bottom on the floor to the lower surrounding ledge there are two cubits, and the width is one cubit. And from the small surrounding ledge to the big surrounding ledge there are four cubits, and [its] width is a cubit. 15 And the altar hearth is four cubits, and out from the altar hearth and upward there are the four horns. + 16 And the altar hearth is twelve [cubits] in length, with twelve [cubits] of width, + squared on its four sides. + 17 And the surrounding ledge is fourteen [cubits] in length, with fourteen [cubits] of width, on its four sides; and the border surrounding it is half a cubit, and its bottom is a cubit round about. “And its * steps are facing east.” 18 And he proceeded to say to me: “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘These are the statutes of the altar on the day of its being made, in order to offer upon it whole burnt offerings + and to sprinkle upon it blood.’ + 19 “‘And you must give to the Levitical priests, + who are of the offspring * of Zaʹdok, + the ones approaching me,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘to minister to me, a young bull, the son of [the] herd, as a sin offering. + 20 And you must take some of its blood and put [it] upon its four horns and upon the four corners of the surrounding ledge and upon the border round about and purify it from sin + and make atonement for it. + 21 And you must take the young bull, the sin offering, and one must burn it in the appointed place of the House, outside the sanctuary. + 22 And on the second day you will bring near a buck of the goats, a sound one, as a sin offering; and they must purify the altar from sin the same as they purified [it] from sin with the young bull.’ 23 “‘On your making an end of the purifying from sin you will bring near a young bull, the son of [the] herd, a sound one, and a ram from the flock, a sound one. 24 And you must bring them near before Jehovah, and the priests must throw salt upon them and offer them + up as a whole burnt offering to Jehovah. 25 For seven days you will render up a he-goat as a sin offering for the day; + and a young bull, the son of [the] herd, and a ram out of the flock, perfect ones, they will render up. 26 For seven days they will make atonement + for the altar, and they must cleanse it and install it. * 27 And they will complete the days. And it must occur on the eighth day + and from then on that the priests will render upon the altar the whole burnt offerings of YOU people and YOUR communion sacrifices; and I shall certainly find pleasure in YOU ,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ “The glory of the God of Israel.” Heb., kevohdhʹ ʼElo·hehʹ Yis·ra·ʼelʹ . ^ “When I came,” M; ThVg and six Heb. mss, “when he came”; T, “when I prophesied for making [the city] waste away.” ^ “There were appearances,” M; LXX, “the vision of the chariot, that I saw (was).” ^ Or, “vision.” ^ Or, “the glory of Jehovah filled the House.” ^ “A spirit.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma; Lat., spiʹri·tus . ^ “And [the] man .” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “This is,” T; LXX, “you have seen”; but M has only the particle that is the sign of the accusative case for the next word. ^ “At their death,” TTh and about 20 Heb. mss and ed.; M, “their high places”; LXX, “in the midst of them.” ^ See 40:5 ftn, “Handbreadth.” ^ Or, “blood channel”; or, “molding.” ^ “Its,” masc., referring to the altar. ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “fill its hand.” Compare 2Ch 13:9 ftn, “Power.” Previous Next Print Share Share
