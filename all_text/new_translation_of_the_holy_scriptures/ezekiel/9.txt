Let not your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion. + 6 Old man, young man and virgin and little child and women + YOU should kill off—to a ruination. But to any man upon whom there is the mark do not go near, + and from my sanctuary YOU should start.” + So they started with the old men * that were before the house. + 7 And he said further to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain ones. + Go forth!” And they went forth and struck in the city. 8 And it came about that, while they were striking and I was left remaining, I proceeded to fall upon my face + and cry out and say: “Alas, + O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you bringing to ruin all the remaining ones of Israel while you are pouring out your rage upon Jerusalem?” + 9 So he said to me: “The error of the house of Israel and Judah + is very, very great, + and the land is filled with bloodshed * + and the city is full of crookedness; + for they have said, ‘Jehovah has left the land, * + and Jehovah is not seeing.’ * + 10 And as for me also, my eye will not feel sorry, + neither shall I show compassion. + Their way I shall certainly bring upon their own head.” + 11 And, look! the man * clothed with the linen, at whose hips there was the inkhorn, * was bringing back word, saying: “I have done just as you have commanded me.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “writing case.” ^ “And there was one man .” Heb., we ʼish-ʼe·chadhʹ . ^ “Men.” Heb., ʼana·shimʹ, pl. of ʼish . ^ “God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ Lit., “the cherub .” Heb., hak· keruvʹ , sing. but likely in a collective sense.
