But we exhort YOU , brothers, to go on doing it in fuller measure, 11 and to make it YOUR aim to live quietly + and to mind YOUR own business + and work with YOUR hands, + just as we ordered YOU ; 12 so that YOU may be walking decently + as regards people outside + and not be needing anything. + 13 Moreover, brothers, we do not want YOU to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping + [in death]; that YOU may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope. + 14 For if our faith is that Jesus died and rose again, + so, too, those who have fallen asleep [in death] through Jesus God will bring with him. + 15 For this is what we tell YOU by Jehovah’s * word, + that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord * + shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep [in death]; 16 because the Lord * himself will descend from heaven + with a commanding call, with an archangel’s + voice and with God’s trumpet, + and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first. + 17 Afterward we the living who are surviving * will, together * with them, + be caught away + in clouds + to meet + the Lord * in the air; and thus we shall always be with [the] Lord. * + 18 Consequently keep comforting one another with these words.
