It was with working + night and day, so as not to put an expensive burden upon any one of YOU , + that we preached the good news of God to YOU . 10 Y OU are witnesses, God is also, how loyal and righteous and unblamable + we proved to be to YOU believers. 11 In harmony with that YOU well know how, as a father + does his children, we kept exhorting + each one of YOU , and consoling and bearing witness to YOU , 12 to the end that YOU should go on walking + worthily of God who is calling + YOU to his kingdom + and glory. 13 Indeed, that is why we also thank God incessantly, + because when YOU received God’s word, + which YOU heard from us, YOU accepted it, not as the word of men, + but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which * is also at work in YOU believers. + 14 For YOU became imitators, * brothers, of the congregations of God that are in Ju·deʹa in union with Christ Jesus, because YOU also began suffering + at the hands of YOUR own countrymen the same things as they also [are suffering] at the hands of the Jews, 15 who killed even the Lord Jesus + and the prophets + and persecuted us. + Furthermore, they are not pleasing God, but are against [the interests of] all men, 16 as they try to hinder * + us from speaking to people of the nations that these might be saved, + with the result that they always fill up the measure + of their sins. But his * wrath has at length * come upon them. + 17 As for ourselves, brothers, when we were bereaved * of YOU for but a short time, * in person, not in heart, we endeavored far more than is usual to see YOUR faces with great desire. + 18 For this reason we wanted to come to YOU , yes, I Paul, both once and a second time, but Satan cut across our path. 19 For what is our hope or joy or crown + of exultation—why, is it not in fact YOU ?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence? * + 20 Y OU certainly are our glory and joy.
