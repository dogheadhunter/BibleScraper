In the rest of the jurisdictional districts + of the king what have they done? + And what is your petition? Let it even be given to you. + And what is your further request? + Let it even be done.” 13 Accordingly Esther said: “If to the king it does seem good, + let it be granted tomorrow also to the Jews that are in Shuʹshan to do according to the law of today; + and let the ten sons of Haʹman be hanged upon the stake.” + 14 So the king said for it to be done that way. + Then a law was given out in Shuʹshan, and the ten sons of Haʹman were hanged. 15 And the Jews that were in Shuʹshan proceeded to congregate themselves also on the fourteenth + day of the month Aʹdar, and they got to kill in Shuʹshan three hundred men; but on the plunder they did not lay their hand. + 16 As for the rest of the Jews that were in the jurisdictional districts + of the king, they congregated themselves, and there was a stand * for their souls, * + and there was an avenging + of themselves upon * their enemies and a killing * among those hating them of seventy-five thousand; but on the plunder they did not lay their hand, 17 on the thirteenth day of the month Aʹdar; and there was a rest on the fourteenth [day] of it, and there was a making * of it a day of banqueting + and of rejoicing. + 18 As for the Jews that were in Shuʹshan, they congregated themselves on the thirteenth + [day] of it and on the fourteenth [day] of it, and there was a rest on the fifteenth [day] of it, and there was a making of it a day of banqueting and of rejoicing. + 19 That is why the country Jews, inhabiting the cities of the outlying districts, were making the fourteenth day of the month Aʹdar + a rejoicing + and a banqueting and a good day + and a sending of portions + to one another. 20 And Morʹde·cai + proceeded to write these things and send written documents to all the Jews that were in all the jurisdictional districts + of King A·has·u·eʹrus, * the nearby and the distant ones, 21 to impose upon them the obligation + to be regularly holding the fourteenth day of the month Aʹdar and the fifteenth day of it in each and every year, 22 according to the days on which the Jews had rested from their enemies + and the month that was changed for them from grief to rejoicing and from mourning + to a good day, to hold them as days of banqueting and rejoicing and sending of portions to one another + and of gifts to the poor people. + 23 And the Jews accepted what they had started to do and what Morʹde·cai had written to them. 24 For Haʹman + the son of Ham·me·daʹtha, + the Agʹag·ite, + the one showing hostility + to all the Jews, had himself schemed against the Jews to destroy them, + and he had had Pur, + that is, the Lot, + cast, to disquiet them and destroy them. 25 But when Esther * came in before the king he said with the written document: + “Let his bad scheme + that he has schemed against the Jews come back upon his own head”; + and they hanged him and his sons upon the stake. + 26 That is why they called these days Puʹrim, by the name of the Pur. + That is why, according to all the words of this letter + and what they had seen as to this and what had come upon them, 27 the Jews imposed and accepted upon themselves and upon their offspring * and upon all those joining themselves to them, + that it should not pass away, the obligation to be regularly holding these two days according to what was written concerning them and according to their appointed time in each and every year. 28 And these days were to be remembered and held in each and every generation, each family, each jurisdictional district and each city, and these days of Puʹrim themselves should not pass away from the midst of the Jews and the commemoration + itself of them not come to an end among their offspring. 29 And Esther the queen, the daughter of Abʹi·ha·il, + and Morʹde·cai the Jew proceeded to write with all forcefulness to confirm this second letter concerning Puʹrim. 30 Then he * sent written documents to all the Jews in the one hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts, + the realm of A·has·u·eʹrus, + [in] words of peace and truth, + 31 to confirm these days of Puʹrim at their appointed times, just as Morʹde·cai the Jew and Esther the queen had imposed upon them, + and just as they had imposed upon their own soul * and upon their offspring, + the matters of the fasts + and their cry for aid. + 32 And the very saying of Esther confirmed these matters of Puʹrim, + and it was written down in a book.
