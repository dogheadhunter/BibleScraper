Let it even be given to you. + And what is your request? To the half of the kingship + —let it even be done!” 3 At this Esther the queen answered and said: “If I have found favor in your eyes, O king, and if to the king it does seem good, let there be given me my own soul * + at my petition and my people + at my request. 4 For we have been sold, + I and my people, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed. + Now if we had been sold for mere men slaves + and for mere maidservants, I should have kept silent. But the distress is not appropriate when with damage to the king.” * 5 King A·has·u·eʹrus now said, yes, he went on to say to Esther the queen: “Who is this, + and just where is the one * who has emboldened + himself * to do that way?” 6 Then Esther said: “The man, the adversary + and enemy, + is this bad Haʹman.” As for Haʹman, he became terrified + because of the king and the queen. 7 As for the king, he rose up in his rage + from the banquet of wine [to go] to the garden of the palace; and Haʹman himself stood up to make request for his soul * from Esther the queen, + for he saw that bad had been determined + against him * by the king. + 8 And the king himself returned from the garden of the palace to the house of the wine banquet; + and Haʹman was fallen upon the couch + on which Esther was. Consequently the king said: “Is there also to be a raping of the queen, with me in the house?” The word itself went out of the king’s mouth, + and Haʹman’s face they covered. 9 Har·boʹna, + one of the court officials + before the king, now said: “Also, there is the stake + that Haʹman made for Morʹde·cai, who had spoken good concerning the king, + standing in Haʹman’s house—fifty cubits * high.” At that the king said: “Y OU men, hang him on it.” + 10 And they proceeded to hang Haʹman on the stake + that he had prepared for Morʹde·cai; + and the king’s rage itself subsided.

This appears to be the fourth acrostic of the divine name, יהוה ( YHWH ), in Esther. It is formed by the final letters of the four words, read from right to left in Heb., as follows: ה הרע ו אלי ה כלת ־ י כ . ^ See 5:14 ftn, “Cubits.” Previous Next Print Share Share
