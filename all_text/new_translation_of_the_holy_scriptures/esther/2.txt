Everything that she would mention would be given her, to come with her from the house of the women to the king’s house. + 14 In the evening she herself came in, and in the morning she herself returned to the second house of the women in charge of Sha·ashʹgaz the king’s eunuch, + the guardian of the concubines. She would not come in anymore to the king unless the king had taken delight in her and she had been called by name. + 15 And when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abʹi·ha·il the uncle of Morʹde·cai, whom he had taken as his daughter, + arrived to come in to the king, she did not request anything + except what Hegʹa·i + the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the women, proceeded to mention (all the while Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her). + 16 Then Esther was taken to King A·has·u·eʹrus at his royal house in the tenth month, that is, the month Teʹbeth, * in the seventh year + of his reign. 17 And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins. + And he proceeded to put the royal headdress upon her head and make her queen + instead of Vashʹti. 18 And the king went on to hold a great banquet for all his princes and his servants, the banquet of Esther; and an amnesty + for the jurisdictional districts he granted, and he kept giving presents according to the means of the king. 19 Now when virgins + were collected together a second time, Morʹde·cai was sitting in the king’s gate. + 20 Esther was not telling about her relatives and her people, + just as Morʹde·cai + had laid the command upon her; + and the saying of Morʹde·cai Esther was performing, just as when she happened to be under care by him. + 21 In those days while Morʹde·cai was sitting in the king’s gate, Bigʹthan and Teʹresh, two court officials of the king, doorkeepers, became indignant and kept seeking to lay hand + on King A·has·u·eʹrus. 22 And the thing came to be known to Morʹde·cai, and he immediately told + Esther the queen. In turn Esther talked to the king in Morʹde·cai’s name. + 23 So the matter was sought out and eventually found out, and both of them got to be hanged + on a stake; * + after which it was written in the book of the affairs + of the days before the king.
