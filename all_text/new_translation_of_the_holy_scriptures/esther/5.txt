Esther now came near and touched the top of the scepter. 3 Then the king said to her: “What do you have, O Esther the queen, and what is your request? + To the half of the kingship + —let it even be given to you!” 4 In turn Esther said: “If to the king it does seem good, let the king with Haʹman + come today * to the banquet + that I have made for him.” 5 Accordingly the king said: “Y OU men, have Haʹman act quickly + on the word of Esther.” Later the king and Haʹman came to the banquet that Esther had made. 6 In time the king said to Esther during the banquet of wine: “What is your petition? + Let it even be granted you! And what is your request? To the half of the kingship—let it even be done!” 7 To this Esther answered and said: “My petition and my request is, 8 If I have found favor in the king’s eyes + and if to the king it does seem good to grant my petition and to act on my request, let the king and Haʹman come to the banquet that I shall hold for them [tomorrow], * and tomorrow I shall do according to the king’s word.” + 9 Consequently Haʹman went out on that day joyful + and merry of heart; but as soon as Haʹman saw Morʹde·cai in the king’s gate + and that he did not rise + and did not quake on account of him, + Haʹman was immediately filled with rage + against Morʹde·cai. 10 However, Haʹman kept control of himself and came into his house. Then he sent and had his friends * and Zeʹresh + his wife brought in; 11 and Haʹman proceeded to declare to them the glory of his riches + and the large number of his sons + and everything with which the king had magnified him and how he had exalted him over the princes and the servants of the king. + 12 And Haʹman went on to say: “What is more, Esther the queen brought in with the king to the banquet that she had made no one but me, + and tomorrow + also I am invited to her with the king. 13 But all this—none of it suits me * as long as I am seeing Morʹde·cai the Jew sitting in the king’s gate.” 14 At that Zeʹresh his wife and all his friends said to him: “Let them make a stake * + fifty cubits * high. Then in the morning + say to the king that they should hang Morʹde·cai on it. + Then go in with the king to the banquet joyful.” So the thing seemed good + before Haʹman, and he proceeded to have the stake made. + Footnotes ^ “Let the king with Haman come today.” This appears to be the second acrostic of the Tetragrammaton, YHWH, in Esther. ­ Y a·vohʼʹ H am·meʹlekh W eha·manʹ H ai·yohmʹ , in Heb.
