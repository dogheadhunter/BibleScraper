At this the king grew highly indignant and his very rage flared up within him. + 13 And the king proceeded to say to the wise + men having knowledge of the times + (for in this way the king’s matter [came] before all those versed in law and legal cases, 14 and those closest to him were Car·sheʹna, Sheʹthar, Ad·maʹtha, Tarʹshish, Meʹres, Mar·seʹna, [and] Me·muʹcan, seven + princes of Persia and Meʹdi·a, having access to the king, * + [and] who were sitting first in the kingdom): 15 “According to law what is to be done with Queen Vashʹti because she has not performed the saying of King A·has·u·eʹrus by means of the court officials?” 16 To this Me·muʹcan + said before the king and the princes: “It is not against the king alone that Vashʹti the queen has done wrong, + but against all the princes and against all the peoples that are in all the jurisdictional districts of King A·has·u·eʹrus. 17 For the affair of the queen will go out to all the wives so that they will despise + their owners * + in their own eyes, when they say, ‘King A·has·u·eʹrus himself said to bring in Vashʹti the queen before him, and she did not come in.’ 18 And this day the princesses of Persia and Meʹdi·a, who have heard the affair of the queen, will talk to all the princes of the king, and there will be plenty of contempt and indignation. + 19 If to the king it does seem good, + let a royal word go out from his person, and let it be written among the laws + of Persia and Meʹdi·a, that it may not pass away, + that Vashʹti may not come in before King A·has·u·eʹrus; and her royal dignity let the king give to a companion of hers, a woman better than she is. 20 And the decree of the king that he will make must be heard in all his realm (for it is vast), and all the wives themselves will give * honor + to their owners, + the great as well as the small.” 21 And the thing was pleasing in the eyes of the king + and the princes, and the king proceeded to do according to the word of Me·muʹcan. 22 So he sent written documents + to all the king’s jurisdictional districts, to each jurisdictional district + in its own style of writing and to each people in its own tongue, for every husband to be continually acting as prince in his own house + and speaking in the tongue of his own people.

Three ancient Heb. mss are known that give the letters of the divine name here in acrostic in majuscule letters, as follows: תנו י נשים ה כל־ ו יא ה. This is the first of four such acrostics of the name “Jehovah,” and the Masorah in a ru­bric, or in red letters, calls attention to this. Previous Next Print Share Share
