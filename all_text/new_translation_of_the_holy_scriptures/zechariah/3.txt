Upon the one stone there are seven eyes. * + Here I am engraving its engraving,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘and I will take away the error of that land in one day.’ + 10 “‘In that day,’ is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, ‘ YOU will call, each one to the other, while under [the] vine and while under [the] fig tree.’” + Footnotes ^ “Joshua.” Heb., Yehoh·shuʹaʽ; LXXVg, “Jesus.” See Heb 4:8 ftn, “Joshua.” ^ Or, “the messenger.” ^ Or, “and the Resister.” Lit., “and the Satan.” Heb., wehas·Sa·tanʹ; Lat., Saʹtan; Gr., Di·aʹbo·los .
