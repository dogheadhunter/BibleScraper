Jehovah * himself will dispossess her, and into the sea he will certainly strike down her military force; + and in the fire she herself will be devoured. + 5 Ashʹke·lon will see and get afraid; and as for Gaʹza, she will also feel very severe pains; Ekʹron + also, because her looked-for hope + will have to experience shame. And a king will certainly perish from Gaʹza, and Ashʹke·lon herself will not be inhabited. + 6 And an illegitimate + son will actually seat himself in Ashʹdod, + and I shall certainly cut off the pride of the Phi·lisʹtine. + 7 And I will remove his bloodstained things from his mouth and his disgusting things from between his teeth, + and he himself also will certainly be left remaining for our God; * and he must become like a sheik * + in Judah, + and Ekʹron like the Jebʹu·site. + 8 And I will encamp as an outpost for my house, + so that there will be no one passing through and no one returning; and there will no more pass through them a taskmaster, + for now I have seen [it] with my eyes. + 9 “Be very joyful, O daughter of Zion. + Shout in triumph, + O daughter of Jerusalem. Look! Your king + himself comes to you. + He is righteous, yes, saved; * + humble, * + and riding upon an ass, even upon a full-grown animal the son of a she-ass. * + 10 And I shall certainly cut off * [the] war chariot from Eʹphra·im and [the] horse from Jerusalem. + And the battle bow + must be cut off. And he will actually speak peace to the nations; + and his rulership will be from sea to sea and from the River * to the ends * of [the] earth. + 11 “Also, you, [O woman,] * by the blood of your * covenant + I will send your prisoners + out of the pit in which there is no water. 12 “Return to the stronghold, * + YOU prisoners of the hope. + “Also, today [I am] telling [you], ‘I shall repay to you, [O woman,] * a double portion. * + 13 For I will tread as my [bow] * Judah. The bow I will fill with Eʹphra·im, and I will awaken * your sons, + O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, * + and I will make you * as the sword of a mighty man.’ * + 14 And over them Jehovah himself will be seen, + and his arrow will certainly go forth just like lightning. + And on the horn * the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself will blow, + and he will certainly go with the windstorms of the south. * + 15 Jehovah of armies himself will defend them, and they will actually devour + and subdue the slingstones. And they will certainly drink + —be boisterous—as if there were wine; and they will actually become filled like the bowl, like the corners of [the] altar. + 16 “And Jehovah their God * will certainly save them + in that day like the flock of his people; + for they will be as the stones of a diadem glittering over his * soil. + 17 For O how [great] his goodness is, + and how [great] his handsomeness is! + Grain is what will make the young men thrive, and new wine the virgins.” + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §4. ^ See App 1C §4. ^ “And gold .” Heb., we cha·rutsʹ . ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
