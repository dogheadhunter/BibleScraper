Hey there! Flee, then, YOU people, from the land of the north,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “For in the direction of the four winds * of the heavens I have spread YOU people abroad,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 7 “Hey there, Zion! + Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon. * + 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Following after [the] glory + he has sent me to the nations that were despoiling YOU people; + for he that is touching YOU + is touching my eyeball. * + 9 For here I am waving my hand against them, + and they will have to become spoil to their slaves.’ + And YOU people will certainly know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me. + 10 “Cry out loudly and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; + for here I am coming, + and I will reside in the midst of you,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 11 “And many nations will certainly become joined to Jehovah in that day, + and they will actually become my people; + and I will reside in the midst of you.” * And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me to you. + 12 And Jehovah will certainly take possession of Judah as his portion upon the holy ground, + and he must yet choose Jerusalem. + 13 Keep silence, all flesh, before Jehovah, + for he has aroused himself + from his holy dwelling. + Footnotes ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “I shall prove to be.” Heb., ʼeh·yehʹ .
