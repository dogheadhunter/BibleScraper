I myself will go also.” + 22 And many peoples and mighty nations will actually come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem + and to soften the face of Jehovah.’ 23 “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘It will be in those days that ten men * out of all the languages * of the nations + will take hold, + yes, they will actually take hold of the skirt of a man * who is a Jew, * + saying: “We will go with YOU people, + for we have heard [that] God * is with YOU people.”’” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the city of truth .” Heb., ʽir- ha· ʼemethʹ . ^ Or, “wonderful.” LXX, “impossible.” ^ “Although it shall be impossible in the sight of the remaining ones of this people in those days, shall it also be impossible in my sight?” LXX.
