And its seven lamps are upon it, even seven; + and the lamps that are at the top of it have seven pipes. 3 And there are two olive trees alongside it, + one on the right side of the bowl and one on its left side.” 4 Then I answered and said to the angel who was speaking with me, saying: “What do these [things] mean, my lord?” * + 5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me: “Do you not really know what these things mean?” In turn I said: “No, my lord.” + 6 Accordingly he answered and said to me: “This is the word of Jehovah to Ze·rubʹba·bel, saying, ‘“Not by a military force, * + nor by power, * + but by my spirit,” * + Jehovah of armies has said. 7 Who are you, O great mountain? + Before Ze·rubʹba·bel + [you will become] a level land. And he will certainly bring forth the headstone. + There will be shoutings + to it: “How charming! How charming!”’” + 8 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: 9 “The very hands of Ze·rubʹba·bel have laid the foundation of this house, + and his own hands will finish [it]. + And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies himself has sent me to YOU people. + 10 For who has despised the day of small things? + And they will certainly rejoice + and see the plummet * in the hand of Ze·rubʹba·bel. These seven are the eyes of Jehovah. + They are roving about in all the earth.” + 11 And I proceeded to answer and say to him: “What do these two olive trees on the right side of the lampstand and on its left side mean?” + 12 Then I answered the second time and said to him: “What are the two bunches of twigs * of the olive trees that, by means of the two golden tubes, are pouring forth from within themselves the golden [liquid]?” 13 So he said to me: “Do you not really know what these [things] mean?” In turn I said: “No, my lord.” + 14 Accordingly he said: “These are the two anointed ones * + who are standing alongside the Lord of the whole earth.” * + Footnotes ^ “My lord .” Heb., ʼadho·n iʹ . ^ Or, “by vital energy .” Heb., ve chaʹyil . ^ “By power .” Heb., ve khoʹach . ^ “By my spirit .” Heb., be ru·ch iʹ; Gr., pneuʹma·ti ; Lat., spiʹri·tu .
