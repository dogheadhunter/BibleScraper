The howling of shepherds, + for their majesty has been despoiled. + Listen! The roaring of maned young lions, for the proud [thickets] * along the Jordan have been despoiled. + 4 “This is what Jehovah my God * has said, ‘Shepherd the flock [meant] for the killing, + 5 the buyers of which proceed to kill + [them] although they are not held guilty. + And those who are selling + them say: “May Jehovah be blessed, while I shall gain riches.” + And their own shepherds do not show any compassion upon them.’ + 6 “‘For I shall show compassion no more upon the inhabitants of the land,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘So here I am causing mankind * to find themselves, each one in the hand of his companion + and in the hand of his king; + and they will certainly crush to pieces the land, and I shall do no delivering out of their hand.’” + 7 And I proceeded to shepherd the flock + [meant] for the killing, + in YOUR behalf, O afflicted ones of the flock. * + So I took for myself two staffs. + The one I called Pleasantness, + and the other I called Union, * + and I went shepherding the flock. 8 And I finally effaced three shepherds in one lunar month, + as my soul gradually became impatient with them, + and also their own soul felt a loathing toward me. 9 At length I said: “I shall not keep shepherding YOU . * + The one that is dying, let her die. And the one that is being effaced, let her be effaced. + And as for the ones left remaining, let them devour, each one the flesh of her companion.” + 10 So I took my staff Pleasantness + and cut it to pieces, + in order to break my covenant that I had concluded with all the peoples. + 11 And it came to be broken in that day, and the afflicted ones of the flock * + who were watching + me got to know in this way that it was the word of Jehovah. 12 Then I said to them: * “If it is good in YOUR eyes, + give [me] my wages; but if not, refrain.” And they proceeded to pay * my wages, thirty pieces of silver. + 13 At that, Jehovah said to me: “Throw it to the treasury * + —the majestic value with which I have been valued from their standpoint.” + Accordingly I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into the treasury at the house of Jehovah. + 14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff, the Union, + in order to break the brotherhood + between Judah and Israel. + 15 And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Take yet for yourself the implements of a useless shepherd. + 16 For here I am letting a shepherd rise up in the land. + To the [sheep] * being effaced he will give no attention. + The young one he will not seek, and the broken [sheep] he will not heal. + The one stationing herself * he will not supply [with food], and the flesh of the fat one he will eat, + and the hoofs of the [sheep] * he will tear off. + 17 Woe to my valueless shepherd, + who is leaving the flock! + A sword will be upon his arm and upon his right eye. His own arm will without fail dry up, + and his own right eye will without fail grow dim.” Footnotes ^ Or, “fortified; inaccessible.” M margin , “interdicted.” ^ “Proud [thickets].” Or, “high [trees].” Lit., “pride.” ^ “ Jehovah my God ,” M(Heb., Yehwahʹ ʼElo·h aiʹ )TSyVg; Gr., Kyʹri·os pan·to·kraʹtor, “Jehovah Almighty.” ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ According to M; by a regrouping and a change in vowel pointing, “in behalf of the tradesmen of the flock.” ^ Lit., “Binders.” Heb., Cho·velimʹ; that which results in a union of things. ^ “You,” masc. pl. ^ “The afflicted ones of the flock,” M.
