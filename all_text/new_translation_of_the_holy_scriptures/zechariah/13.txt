I am a man * cultivating [the] soil, because an earthling man * himself acquired me from my youth on.’ 6 And one must say to him, ‘What are these wounds * [on your person] between your hands?’ And he will have to say, ‘Those with which I was struck * in the house of my intense lovers.’” 7 “O sword, awake against my shepherd, + even against the able-bodied man who is my associate,” + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. “Strike the shepherd, + and let those of the flock be scattered; + and I shall certainly turn my hand back upon those who are insignificant.” * + 8 “And it must occur in all the land,” * is the utterance of Jehovah, “[that] two parts in it are what will be cut off [and] expire; + and as for the third [part], it will be left remaining in it. + 9 And I shall certainly bring the third [part] through the fire; + and I shall actually refine them as in the refining of silver, + and examine them as in the examining of gold. + It, for its part, will call upon my name, and I, for my part, will answer it. + I will say, ‘It is my people,’ + and it, in its turn, will say, ‘Jehovah is my God.’” + Footnotes ^ Or, “mentioned.” ^ Or, “the expression inspired by uncleanness”; or, “the unclean inspired expression.” Compare Re 16:13 ftn, “Expressions.” ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “An earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ; Gr., anʹthro·pos; Vg, “Adam ([was, or, is] my example).” ^ Or, “wounded.” ^ Or, “strokes.” ^ Or, “the boy keepers .” Heb., hats· tso·ʽarimʹ ; LXX A , “the shepherds”; LXX א ,B Vg, “the little ones,” masc.; Sy, “the superior (great) ones.” ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets .
