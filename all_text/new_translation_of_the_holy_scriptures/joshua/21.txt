12 and the field of the city and its settlements they gave to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh as his possession. + 13 And to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave the city of refuge + for the manslayer, + namely, Heʹbron, + and its pasture ground, also Libʹnah + and its pasture ground, 14 and Jatʹtir + and its pasture ground, and Esh·te·moʹa + and its pasture ground, 15 and Hoʹlon * + and its pasture ground, and Deʹbir + and its pasture ground, 16 and Aʹin * + and its pasture ground, and Jutʹtah + and its pasture ground, Beth-sheʹmesh + and its pasture ground; nine cities out of these two tribes. 17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibʹe·on + and its pasture ground, Geʹba + and its pasture ground, 18 Anʹa·thoth + and its pasture ground, and Alʹmon * + and its pasture ground; four cities. 19 All the cities of the sons of Aaron, + the priests, were thirteen cities and their pasture grounds. + 20 And for the families of the sons of Koʹhath, the Levites who were left over of the sons of Koʹhath, there came to be by their lot cities out of the tribe of Eʹphra·im. + 21 Accordingly they gave them the city of refuge + for the manslayer, + namely, Sheʹchem, + and its pasture ground + in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and Geʹzer + and its pasture ground, 22 and Kibʹza·im * + and its pasture ground, and Beth-hoʹron + and its pasture ground; four cities. 23 And from the tribe of Dan, Elʹte·ke and its pasture ground, Gibʹbe·thon + and its pasture ground, 24 Aiʹja·lon + and its pasture ground, Gath-rimʹmon + and its pasture ground; four cities. 25 And from the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh, Taʹa·nach + and its pasture ground, and Gath-rimʹmon and its pasture ground; two cities. 26 All the cities together with their pasture grounds that the families of the sons of Koʹhath who were left over had were ten. 27 And for the sons of Gerʹshon, + of the families of the Levites, there was out of the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh + the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Goʹlan, + in Baʹshan, and its pasture ground, and Be·eshʹte·rah * + and its pasture ground; two cities. 28 And out of the tribe of Isʹsa·char, + Kishʹi·on + and its pasture ground, Dabʹe·rath + and its pasture ground, 29 Jarʹmuth * + and its pasture ground, En-ganʹnim + and its pasture ground; four cities. 30 And out of the tribe of Ashʹer, + Miʹshal + and its pasture ground, Abʹdon + and its pasture ground, 31 Helʹkath + and its pasture ground, and Reʹhob + and its pasture ground; four cities. 32 And out of the tribe of Naphʹta·li, + the city of refuge + for the manslayer, + namely, Keʹdesh + in Galʹi·lee, * and its pasture ground, and Hamʹmoth-dor + and its pasture ground, and Karʹtan * and its pasture ground; three cities. 33 All the cities of the Gerʹshon·ites by their families were thirteen cities and their pasture grounds. 34 And the families of the sons of Me·rarʹi, + the Levites who were left over, had out of the tribe of Zebʹu·lun + Jokʹne·am + and its pasture ground, Karʹtah and its pasture ground, 35 Dimʹnah * + and its pasture ground, Na·halʹal + and its pasture ground; four cities. 36 And out of the tribe of Reuʹben, + Beʹzer + and its pasture ground, and Jaʹhaz + and its pasture ground, 37 Kedʹe·moth + and its pasture ground, and Mephʹa·ath + and its pasture ground; four cities. * 38 And out of the tribe of Gad, + the city of refuge for the manslayer, namely, Raʹmoth in Gilʹe·ad, + and its pasture ground, and Ma·ha·naʹim + and its pasture ground, 39 Heshʹbon + and its pasture ground, Jaʹzer + and its pasture ground; all the cities being four. 40 All the cities that came to belong to the sons of Me·rarʹi + by their families, who were left over from the families of the Levites, were, as their lot, twelve cities. 41 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities + together with their pasture grounds. + 42 These cities came to be each a city together with its pasture ground all around it—thus as to all these cities. + 43 So Jehovah gave Israel all the land that he had sworn to give to their forefathers, + and they proceeded to take possession + of it and to dwell in it. 44 Furthermore, Jehovah gave them rest + all around, according to everything that he had sworn + to their forefathers, and not one of all their enemies stood before them. + All their enemies Jehovah gave into their hand. + 45 Not a promise failed out of all the good promise that Jehovah had made to the house of Israel; it all came true. + Footnotes ^ According to M; LXXSyVg, “out of the tribe of.” ^ “Hilen” in 1Ch 6:58 . ^ “Ashan” in 15:42; 19:7; 1Ch 6:59 . ^ “Alemeth” in 1Ch 6:60 . ^ “Jokmeam” in 1Ch 6:68 . ^ “Ashtaroth” in 1Ch 6:71 . ^ “Remeth” in 19:21 ;
