The ark of the covenant of the Lord * of the whole earth is passing before YOU into the Jordan. 12 And now take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe. + 13 And it must occur that at the instant that the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah, the Lord of the whole earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, the waters descending from above, and they will stand still as one dam.” + 14 And it came about that when the people pulled away from their tents just before passing over the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark + of the covenant before the people, 15 and at the instant that the carriers of the Ark came as far as the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the Ark were dipped in the edge of the waters (now the Jordan overflows all its banks + all the days of harvest), 16 then the waters descending from above began to stand still. They rose up as one dam + very far away at Adam, * the city at the side of Zarʹe·than, + while those descending toward the sea of the Arʹa·bah, the Salt Sea, + were exhausted. They were cut off, and the people passed over in front of Jerʹi·cho. 17 Meanwhile the priests carrying the ark of Jehovah’s covenant kept standing immovable on dry ground + in the middle of the Jordan as all Israel were passing over on dry ground, + until the whole nation had completed passing over the Jordan.
