Do not suffer shock or be terrified, + for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” + 10 And Joshua proceeded to command the officers of the people, saying: 11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Get provisions ready for yourselves, because three days from now YOU are crossing this Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that Jehovah YOUR God is giving YOU to take possession of it.’” + 12 And to the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh Joshua said: 13 “Let there be a remembering * of the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded YOU , + saying, ‘Jehovah YOUR God is giving YOU rest and has given YOU this land. 14 Y OUR wives, YOUR little ones and YOUR livestock will dwell in the land that Moses has given YOU on this side of the Jordan; + but YOU men will pass over in battle formation + before YOUR brothers, all the valiant mighty men, + and YOU must help them. 15 First when Jehovah gives rest to YOUR brothers the same as to YOU and they also have taken possession of the land that Jehovah YOUR God is giving them, + YOU must also return to the land of YOUR holding and take possession of it, + the one that Moses the servant of Jehovah has given YOU on the side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun.’” + 16 Accordingly they answered Joshua, saying: “All that you have commanded us we shall do, and wherever you may send us we shall go. + 17 As we listened to Moses in everything, so we shall listen to you. Only may Jehovah your God prove to be with you + just as he proved to be with Moses. + 18 Any man that behaves rebelliously against your order + and does not listen to your words in all that you may command him will be put to death. + Only be courageous and strong.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “slave.” ^ “Joshua.” Heb., Yehoh·shuʹaʽ, “Jehoshua,” meaning “Jehovah Is Salvation”; Gr., Ἰησοῖ ( I·e·soiʹ, “Jesus”); Sy, “Jeshua”; Vg c , “Josue.” See Ge 49:18 ftn, “You”; Heb 4:8 ftn, “Joshua.” ^ Or, “attendant.” Heb., mesha·rethʹ; Lat., mi·niʹstrum . ^ Possibly, “up to.” ^ “Let there be a remembering.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal.
