It is then that the manslayer may return, + and he must enter into his city and into his house, into the city from which he had fled.’” 7 Accordingly they gave a sacred status to Keʹdesh * + in Galʹi·lee * in the mountainous region of Naphʹta·li, and Sheʹchem + in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im, and Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, + that is to say, Heʹbron, in the mountainous region of Judah. 8 And in the region of the Jordan, at Jerʹi·cho, toward the east they gave Beʹzer + in the wilderness on the tableland out of the tribe of Reuʹben, + and Raʹmoth + in Gilʹe·ad out of the tribe of Gad, and Goʹlan + in Baʹshan out of the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh. 9 These became the cities appointed for all the sons of Israel and for the alien resident who resides as an alien in their midst, for anyone to flee there who fatally strikes a soul unintentionally, + that he may not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until his standing before the assembly. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the goel.” ^ Lit., “the great priest,” M; Lat., sa·cerʹdos maʹgnus . ^ Or, “they sanctified Kedesh.” ^ Or, “in the circuit .” Heb., bag· Ga·lilʹ ; Gr., Ga·li·laiʹai ; Lat., Ga·li·leʹa . “Galilee” later designated the Roman province north of Samaria.
