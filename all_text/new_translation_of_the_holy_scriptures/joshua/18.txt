After that they came to Joshua at the camp in Shiʹloh, 10 and Joshua went drawing lots for them in Shiʹloh before Jehovah. + Thus Joshua there apportioned the land to the sons of Israel in their shares. + 11 Then the lot + came up of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin + by their families, and the territory of their lot went out between the sons of Judah + and the sons of Joseph. + 12 And their boundary came to be at the northern corner from the Jordan, and the boundary went up to the slope of Jerʹi·cho + on the north and went up on the mountain westward, and its termination proved to be at the wilderness of Beth-aʹven. + 13 And the boundary passed over from there to Luz, + at the southern slope of Luz, that is to say, Bethʹel; + and the boundary went down to Atʹa·roth-adʹdar + upon the mountain that is on the south of Lower Beth-hoʹron. + 14 And the boundary was marked out and went around at the western side to the south from the mountain that faces Beth-hoʹron to the south; and its termination proved to be at Kirʹi·ath-baʹal, that is to say, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, + a city of the sons of Judah. This is the western side. 15 And the side to the south was from the extremity of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, and the boundary went out westward and went out to the spring of the waters of Neph·toʹah. + 16 And the boundary went down to the extremity of the mountain that faces the valley of the son of Hinʹnom, + which is in the low plain of Rephʹa·im + to the north, and it went down to the valley of Hinʹnom, * to the slope of the Jebʹu·site + on the south, and went down to En-roʹgel. + 17 And it was marked out northward and went out to En-sheʹmesh and went out to Gel·iʹloth, which is in front of the ascent of A·dumʹmim; + and it went down to the stone + of Boʹhan + the son of Reuʹben. 18 And it passed over to the northern slope in front of the Arʹa·bah and went down to the Arʹa·bah. 19 And the boundary passed over to the northern slope of Beth-hogʹlah, + and the termination of it (the border) proved to be at the northern bay of the Salt Sea + at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary. 20 And the Jordan served as its boundary on the eastern side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin by their families, by its boundaries all around. 21 And the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin by their families proved to be Jerʹi·cho + and Beth-hogʹlah and Eʹmek-keʹziz, 22 and Beth-arʹa·bah + and Zem·a·raʹim and Bethʹel, + 23 and Avʹvim and Paʹrah and Ophʹrah, + 24 and Cheʹphar-amʹmo·ni and Ophʹni and Geʹba; + twelve cities and their settlements. 25 Gibʹe·on + and Raʹmah and Be·erʹoth, 26 and Mizʹpeh + and Che·phiʹrah + and Moʹzah, 27 and Reʹkem and Irʹpe·el and Tarʹa·lah, 28 and Zeʹlah, + Ha-eʹleph and Je·buʹsi, * that is to say, Jerusalem, + Gibʹe·ah + and Kirʹi·ath; fourteen cities and their settlements. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin by their families. + Footnotes ^ “Valley of Hinnom.” Heb., geh Hin·nomʹ; Gr., Gaiʹen·na; Lat., Ge·henʹnom .
