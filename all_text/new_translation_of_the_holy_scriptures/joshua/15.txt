This came to be their * southern boundary. 5 And the eastern boundary was the Salt Sea up to the end * of the Jordan, and the boundary at the northern corner was at the bay of the sea, at the end of the Jordan. + 6 And the boundary went up to Beth-hogʹlah + and passed over at the north of Beth-arʹa·bah, + and the boundary went up to the stone of Boʹhan + the son of Reuʹben. 7 And the boundary went up to Deʹbir at the low plain of Aʹchor + and turning northward to Gilʹgal, + which is in front of the ascent of A·dumʹmim, which is south of the torrent valley; and the boundary passed over to the waters of En-sheʹmesh, + and its termination proved to be En-roʹgel. + 8 And the boundary went up to the valley of the son of Hinʹnom + to the slope of the Jebʹu·site + at the south, that is to say, Jerusalem; + and the boundary went up to the top of the mountain that faces the valley of Hinʹnom * to the west, which is at the extremity of the low plain of Rephʹa·im + to the north. 9 And the boundary was marked out from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Neph·toʹah, + and went out to the cities of Mount Eʹphron; and the boundary was marked out to Baʹal·ah, + that is to say, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim. + 10 And the boundary went around from Baʹal·ah westward to Mount Seʹir and passed over to the slope of Mount Jeʹa·rim at the north, that is to say, Chesʹa·lon; and it went down to Beth-sheʹmesh + and passed over to Timʹnah. + 11 And the boundary went out to the slope of Ekʹron + to the north, and the boundary was marked out to Shikʹke·ron and passed over to Mount Baʹal·ah and went out to Jabʹne·el; and the boundary’s termination proved to be at the sea. 12 And the western boundary was at the Great Sea + and its shoreland. This was the boundary all around, of the sons of Judah by their families. 13 And to Caʹleb + the son of Je·phunʹneh he gave a share in the midst of the sons of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirʹi·ath-arʹba ([said Arʹba being] the father of Aʹnak), that is to say, Heʹbron. + 14 So Caʹleb drove away from there the three sons of Aʹnak, + namely, Sheʹshai + and A·hiʹman and Talʹmai, + those born of Aʹnak. * + 15 Then he went up from there to the inhabitants of Deʹbir. + (Now the name of Deʹbir before that was Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.) + 16 And Caʹleb proceeded to say: “Whoever strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and does capture it, I shall certainly give him Achʹsah + my daughter as a wife.” 17 At that Othʹni·el + the son of Keʹnaz, + Caʹleb’s brother, captured it. Accordingly he gave him Achʹsah + his daughter as a wife. 18 And it came about that when she was going home, she kept inciting him to ask a field from her father. Then she clapped her hands while upon the ass. * At this Caʹleb said to her: “What do you want?” + 19 So she said: “Do give me a blessing, for it is a piece of land to the south you have given me, and you must give me Gulʹloth-maʹim.” * Accordingly he gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth. * + 20 This was the inheritance + of the tribe of the sons of Judah + by their families. 21 And the cities at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah toward the boundary of Eʹdom + in the south came to be Kabʹze·el + and Eʹder and Jaʹgur, 22 and Kiʹnah and Di·moʹnah and A·daʹdah, 23 and Keʹdesh and Haʹzor and Ithʹnan, 24 Ziph and Teʹlem + and Be·aʹloth, 25 and Haʹzor-ha·datʹtah and Keʹri·oth-hezʹron, that is to say, Haʹzor, 26 Aʹmam and Sheʹma and Mo·laʹdah, + 27 and Haʹzar-gadʹdah and Heshʹmon and Beth-pelʹet, + 28 and Haʹzar-shuʹal + and Beʹer-sheʹba + and Biz·i·o·thiʹah, 29 Baʹal·ah + and Iʹim and Eʹzem, + 30 and El·toʹlad and Cheʹsil and Horʹmah, + 31 and Zikʹlag + and Mad·manʹnah and San·sanʹnah, 32 and Le·baʹoth and Shilʹhim and Aʹin + and Rimʹmon; + all the cities being twenty-nine, together with their settlements. 33 In the She·pheʹlah + there were Eshʹta·ol + and Zoʹrah + and Ashʹnah, 34 and Za·noʹah + and En-ganʹnim, Tapʹpu·ah and Eʹnam, 35 Jarʹmuth + and A·dulʹlam, + Soʹcoh + and A·zeʹkah, + 36 and Shaʹa·raʹim + and Ad·i·thaʹim and Ge·deʹrah and Ged·e·ro·thaʹim; fourteen cities and their settlements. 37 Zeʹnan and Ha·dashʹah and Migʹdal-gad, 38 and Diʹle·an and Mizʹpeh and Jokʹthe·el, 39 Laʹchish + and Bozʹkath + and Egʹlon, + 40 and Cabʹbon and Lahʹmam and Chitʹlish, 41 and Ge·deʹroth, Beth-daʹgon and Naʹa·mah and Mak·keʹdah; + sixteen cities and their settlements. 42 Libʹnah + and Eʹther + and Aʹshan, 43 and Iphʹtah and Ashʹnah and Neʹzib, 44 and Keiʹlah + and Achʹzib + and Ma·reʹshah; + nine cities and their settlements. 45 Ekʹron + and its dependent towns * and its settlements. 46 From Ekʹron westward all that is alongside Ashʹdod and their settlements. 47 Ashʹdod, + its dependent towns and its settlements; Gaʹza, + its dependent towns and its settlements, down to the torrent valley of Egypt, and the Great Sea * and the adjacent region. + 48 And in the mountainous region Shaʹmir and Jatʹtir + and Soʹcoh, 49 and Danʹnah and Kirʹi·ath-sanʹnah, that is to say, Deʹbir, 50 and Aʹnab and Eshʹte·moh + and Aʹnim, 51 and Goʹshen + and Hoʹlon and Giʹloh; + eleven cities and their settlements. 52 Arab and Duʹmah and Eʹshan, 53 and Jaʹnim and Beth-tapʹpu·ah and A·pheʹkah, 54 and Humʹtah and Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is to say, Heʹbron, + and Ziʹor; nine cities and their settlements. 55 Maʹon, + Carʹmel and Ziph + and Jutʹtah, 56 and Jezʹre·el and Jokʹde·am and Za·noʹah, 57 Kaʹin, Gibʹe·ah and Timʹnah; + ten cities and their settlements. 58 Halʹhul, Beth-zur and Geʹdor, 59 and Maʹa·rath and Beth-aʹnoth and Elʹte·kon; six cities and their settlements. 60 Kirʹi·ath-baʹal, + that is to say, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, + and Rabʹbah; two cities and their settlements. 61 In the wilderness Beth-arʹa·bah, + Midʹdin and Se·caʹcah, 62 and Nibʹshan and the City of Salt and En-geʹdi; + six cities and their settlements. 63 As for the Jebʹu·sites + who were dwelling in Jerusalem, + the sons of Judah were not able to drive them away; + and the Jebʹu·sites continue dwelling with the sons of Judah in Jerusalem down to this day.
