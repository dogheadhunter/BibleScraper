Prey does not depart! 2 There is the sound of [the] whip + and the sound of the rattling of [the] wheel, and the dashing horse and the leaping chariot. + 3 The mounted horseman, and the flame of [the] sword, and the lightning of [the] spear, + and the multitude of slain ones, and the heavy mass of carcasses; and there is no end to the dead bodies. They keep stumbling among their dead bodies; 4 owing to the abundance of the acts of prostitution of the prostitute, + attractive with charm, a mistress of sorceries, she who is ensnaring nations by her acts of prostitution and families by her sorceries. + 5 “Look! I am against you,” * + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, * “and I will put the covering of your skirts over your face, and I will cause nations to see your nakedness, + and kingdoms your dishonor. 6 And I will throw disgusting things upon you, + and I will make you despicable; and I will set you as a spectacle. + 7 And it must occur that everyone seeing you will flee away from you + and will certainly say, ‘Ninʹe·veh has been despoiled! Who will sympathize with her?’ From where shall I seek comforters for you? 8 Are you better than No-aʹmon, + that was sitting by the Nile canals? + Waters were all around her, whose wealth was [the] sea, whose wall was from [the] sea. 9 E·thi·oʹpi·a * was her full might, also Egypt; + and that without limit. Put and the Libʹy·ans * themselves proved to be of assistance to you. * + 10 She, too, was meant for exile; she went into captivity. + Her own children also came to be dashed to pieces at the head of all the streets; + and over her glorified men they cast lots, + and her great ones have all been bound with fetters. + 11 “You yourself will also become drunk; + you will become something hidden. + You yourself also will seek a stronghold from [the] enemy. + 12 All your fortified places are as fig trees with the first ripe fruits, which, if they get wiggled, will certainly fall into the mouth of an eater. + 13 “Look! Your people are women in the midst of you. + To your enemies the gates of your land must without fail be opened. Fire will certainly devour your bars. + 14 Water for a siege draw out for yourself. + Strengthen your fortified places. + Get into the mire, and trample down in the clay; grab hold of [the] brick mold. 15 Even there fire will devour you. A sword will cut you off. + It will devour you like the locust + species. * Make yourself heavy in numbers like the locust species; make yourself heavy in numbers like the locust. * 16 You have multiplied your tradesmen more than the stars of the heavens. + “As for the locust species, * it actually strips off its skin; then it flies away. 17 Your guardsmen are like the locust, * and your recruiting officers like the locust swarm. * They are camping in the stone pens in a cold day. The sun itself has but to shine forth, and away they certainly flee; and their place is really unknown where they are. + 18 “Your shepherds have become drowsy, + O king of As·syrʹi·a; your majestic ones stay in their residences. + Your people have been scattered upon the mountains, and there is no one collecting [them] together. + 19 There is no relief for your catastrophe. Your stroke has become unhealable. + All those hearing the report about you will certainly clap their hands at you; + because upon whom was it that your badness did not pass over constantly?” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “bloods.” ^ “You,” fem. sing., referring to Nineveh. ^ “Jehovah of armies,” MTVg; LXX, “Jehovah God the Almighty.” ^ “Ethiopia,” LXXVg; MTSy, “Cush.” ^ “And the Libyans.” Heb., weLu·vimʹ . ^ “You,” MTVg; LXX, “her.” ^ Or, “like the creeping , unwinged locust .” Heb., kai· yaʹleq .
