Distress will not rise up a second time. + 10 Although they are being interwoven even as thorns + and they are drunken as with their wheat beer, * + they will certainly be devoured like stubble fully dry. + 11 Out of you * there will actually go forth one who is thinking up against Jehovah what is bad, + counseling what is not worth while. * + 12 This is what Jehovah has said: “Although they were in complete form and there were many in that state, even in that state they must be cut down; + and one must pass through. And I shall certainly afflict you, so that I shall not afflict you anymore. + 13 And now I shall break his carrying bar from upon you, + and the bands upon you I shall tear in two. + 14 And concerning you * Jehovah has commanded, ‘Nothing of your name will be sown anymore. + Out of the house of your gods * I shall cut off carved image and molten statue. + I shall make a burial place for you, + because you have been of no account.’ * 15 “Look! Upon the mountains the feet of one bringing good news, * one publishing peace. + O Judah, celebrate your festivals. + Pay your vows; + because no more will any good-for-nothing person * pass again through you. + In his entirety he will certainly be cut off.” * + Footnotes ^ Or, “of Elkosh.” ^ “A God.” Heb., ʼEl; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ Lit., “and a master ( lord ) of.” Heb., u· vaʹʽal . ^ “The productive land also.” Heb., we the·velʹ ; LXX, “the whole [earth]”; Lat., orʹbis , “the circle,” that is, of the earth.
