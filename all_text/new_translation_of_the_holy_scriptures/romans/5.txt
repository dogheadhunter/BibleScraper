For if by one man’s trespass many died, the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift with the undeserved kindness by the one man + Jesus Christ abounded much more to many. + 16 Also, it is not with the free gift + as it was with the way things worked through the one [man] that sinned. + For the judgment + resulted from one trespass in condemnation, + but the gift resulted from many trespasses in a declaration of righteousness. * + 17 For if by the trespass of the one [man] + death ruled as king + through that one, much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness + and of the free gift * + of righteousness rule as kings + in life through the one [person], Jesus Christ. + 18 So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, + likewise also through one act of justification * + the result to men of all sorts + is a declaring of them righteous for life. + 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man many + were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience + of the one [person] many + will be constituted righteous. + 20 Now the Law + came in beside * in order that trespassing might abound. + But where sin + abounded, undeserved kindness + abounded still more. 21 To what end? That, just as sin ruled as king with death, + likewise also undeserved kindness + might rule as king through righteousness with everlasting life + in view through Jesus Christ our Lord.
