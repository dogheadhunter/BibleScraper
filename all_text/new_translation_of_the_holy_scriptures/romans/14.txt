For we shall all stand before the judgment + seat of God; 11 for it is written: “‘As I live,’ says Jehovah, * + ‘to me every knee will bend down, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God.’” + 12 So, then, each of us will render an account for himself to God. * + 13 Therefore let us not be judging + one another any longer, but rather make this YOUR decision, + not to put before a brother + a stumbling block + or a cause for tripping. 14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiled in itself; + only where a man considers something to be defiled, to him it is defiled. + 15 For if because of food your brother is being grieved, you are no longer walking in accord with love. + Do not by your food ruin that one for whom Christ died. + 16 Do not, therefore, let the good YOU people do be spoken of with injury to YOU . 17 For the kingdom of God + does not mean * eating and drinking, + but [means] * righteousness + and peace + and joy + with holy spirit. 18 For he who in this regard slaves for Christ is acceptable to God and has approval with men. + 19 So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace + and the things that are upbuilding to one another. + 20 Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food. + True, all things are clean, but it is injurious to the man who with an occasion for stumbling eats. + 21 It is well not to eat flesh or to drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles. + 22 The faith that you have, have it in accord with yourself in the sight of God. + Happy is the man that does not put himself on judgment by what he approves. 23 But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, + because [he does] not [eat] out of faith. Indeed, everything that is not out of faith is sin. + Footnotes ^ “Jehovah,” J 18,​23 ; P 46 א ABC(Gr.), ho Kyʹri·os; DVgSy h , “God.” See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ “To God,” א ADVgSy h,p ; B omits. ^ Or, “[is].” ^ Or, “is not.” Previous Next Print Share Share
