Keep doing good, + and you will have praise from it; * 4 for it * is God’s minister * to you for your good. + But if you are doing what is bad, + be in fear: for it is not without purpose that it bears the sword; for it is God’s minister, an avenger + to express wrath upon the one practicing what is bad. 5 There is therefore compelling reason * for YOU people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath but also on account of [ YOUR ] conscience. + 6 For that is why YOU are also paying taxes; for they are God’s public servants * + constantly serving this very purpose. * 7 Render * to all their dues, to him who [calls for] the tax, the tax; + to him who [calls for] the tribute, the tribute; to him who [calls for] fear, such fear; + to him who [calls for] honor, such honor. + 8 Do not YOU people be owing anybody a single thing, + except to love one another; + for he that loves his fellowman * has fulfilled [the] law. + 9 For the [law code], “You must not commit adultery, * + You must not murder, + You must not steal, + You must not covet,” + and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this word, namely, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” + 10 Love + does not work evil to one’s neighbor; + therefore love is the law’s + fulfillment. 11 [Do] this, too, because YOU people know the season, * that it is already the hour for YOU to awake + from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers. + 12 The night is well along; the day + has drawn near. Let us therefore put off the works belonging to darkness + and let us put on the weapons + of the light. 13 As in the daytime let us walk decently, + not in revelries and drunken bouts, + not in illicit intercourse and loose conduct, * + not in strife + and jealousy. 14 But put on the Lord * Jesus Christ, + and do not be planning ahead for the desires of the flesh. + Footnotes ^ Or, “every living person.” See App 4A . ^ “Stand placed in their relative positions.” Lit., “having been set in order they are.” ^ Lit., “the (one) setting self against.” ^ Or, “her,” that is, the “authority.” ^ Lit., “servant.” ^ Or, “she,” that is, the “authority.” ^ Lit., “necessity.” ^ “Public servants.” Gr., lei·tour·goiʹ . ^ Or, “devoting themselves to this very thing.” ^ Lit., “Give you back.” ^ Or, “loves the other,” that is, the other of two. ^ Or, “You must not commit marital sexual unfaithfulness.” Gr., Ou moi·kheuʹseis; Lat., non a·dul·te·raʹbis; J 22 (Heb.), loʼ tin·ʼaphʹ .
