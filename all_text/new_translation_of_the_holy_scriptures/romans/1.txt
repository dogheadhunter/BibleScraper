Amen. * 26 That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites, + for both their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; + 27 and likewise even the males left the natural use of the female + and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, + working what is obscene * + and receiving in themselves the full recompense, + which was due for their error. + 28 And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, + God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, + to do the things not fitting, + 29 filled as they were with all unrighteousness, + wickedness, + covetousness, + badness, + being full of envy, + murder, + strife, + deceit, + malicious disposition, + being whisperers, + 30 backbiters, + haters of God, insolent, + haughty, + self-assuming, + inventors of injurious things, + disobedient to parents, + 31 without understanding, + false to agreements, * + having no natural affection, + merciless. + 32 Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, + that those practicing such things are deserving of death, + they not only keep on doing them but also consent + with those practicing them.
