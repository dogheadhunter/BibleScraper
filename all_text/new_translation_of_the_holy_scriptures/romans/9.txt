Amen. 6 However, it is not as though the word of God had failed. + For not all who [spring] from Israel are really “Israel.” + 7 Neither because they are Abraham’s seed are they all children, + but: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.” + 8 That is, the children in the flesh + are not really the children of God, + but the children by the promise + are counted as the seed. 9 For the word of promise was as follows: “At this time I will come and Sarah will have a son.” + 10 Yet not that case alone, but also when Re·bekʹah conceived twins + from the one [man], Isaac our forefather: 11 for when they had not yet been born nor had practiced anything good or vile, + in order that the purpose of God respecting the choosing might continue dependent, not upon works, but upon the One who calls, + 12 it was said to her: “The older will be the slave of the younger.” + 13 Just as it is written: “I loved Jacob, but Eʹsau I hated.” + 14 What shall we say, then? Is there injustice with God? + Never may that become so! 15 For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy upon whomever I do have mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I do show compassion.” + 16 So, then, it depends, not upon the one wishing nor upon the one running, but upon God, + who has mercy. + 17 For the Scripture says to Pharʹaoh: “For this very cause I have let you remain, * that in connection with you I may show my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.” + 18 So, then, upon whom he wishes he has mercy, + but whom he wishes he lets become obstinate. + 19 You will therefore say to me: “Why does he yet find fault? For who has withstood his express will?” + 20 O man, + who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? + Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, “Why did you make me this way?” + 21 What? Does not the potter + have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use? + 22 If, now, God, although having the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, tolerated with much long-suffering vessels of wrath made fit for destruction, + 23 in order that he might make known the riches + of his glory upon vessels + of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, + 24 namely, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, + [what of it]? 25 It is as he says also in Ho·seʹa: “Those not my people + I will call ‘my people,’ and her who was not beloved ‘beloved’; + 26 and in the place where it was said to them, ‘Y OU are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’” + 27 Moreover, Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Although the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, + it is the remnant that will be saved. + 28 For Jehovah * will make an accounting on the earth, concluding it and cutting it short.” * + 29 Also, just as Isaiah had said aforetime: “Unless Jehovah * of armies + had left a seed to us, we should have become just like Sodʹom, and we should have been made just like Go·morʹrah.” + 30 What shall we say, then? That people of the nations, although not pursuing righteousness, caught up with righteousness, + the righteousness that results from faith; + 31 but Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law. + 32 For what reason? Because he pursued it, not by faith, but as by works. + They stumbled on the “stone of stumbling”; + 33 as it is written: “Look! I am laying in Zion a stone + of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense, + but he that rests his faith on it * will not come to disappointment.” * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “anathema.” Gr. and Lat., a·naʹthe·ma . ^ “Sacred service.” Gr., la·treiʹa; J 17 (Heb.), weha· ʽavoh·dhahʹ , “and the service ( worship ).” See Ex 12:25 ftn. ^ For a discussion of “God, who is over all” see App 6D . ^ “I have let you remain,” J 17,​18,​22 ; א AB, “I have raised you up”; Ex 9:16 in LXX, which Paul here quotes, “you have been preserved.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “executing it speedily.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “him.” ^ Or, “not be ashamed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
