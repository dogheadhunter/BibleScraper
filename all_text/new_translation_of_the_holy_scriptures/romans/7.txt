Is the Law sin? + Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin + if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness + if the Law had not said: “You must * not covet.” + 8 But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, + worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead. + 9 In fact, I was once alive apart from law; + but when the commandment arrived, + sin came to life again, but I died. + 10 And the commandment which was to life, + this I found to be to death. + 11 For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced + me and killed me through it. 12 Wherefore, on its part, the Law is holy, + and the commandment is holy and righteous + and good. + 13 Did, then, what is good become death to me? Never may that happen! But sin did, that it might be shown as sin working out death for me through that which is good; + that sin might become far more sinful through the commandment. + 14 For we know that the Law is spiritual; + but I am fleshly, sold under sin. + 15 For what I am working out I do not know. For what I wish, * this I do not practice; but what I hate is what I do. 16 However, if what I do not wish is what I do, + I agree that the Law is fine. + 17 But now the one working it out is no longer I, but sin that resides in me. + 18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; + for ability to wish + is present with me, but ability to work out + what is fine is not [present]. 19 For the good that I wish I do not do, + but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice. 20 If, now, what I do not wish is what I do, the one working it out is no longer I, but the sin dwelling in me. + 21 I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, + what is bad is present with me. + 22 I really delight + in the law of God according to the man + I am within, 23 but I behold in my members + another law warring + against the law of my mind + and leading me captive to sin’s law + that is in my members. 24 Miserable * man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death? + 25 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! + So, then, with [my] mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, + but with [my] flesh to sin’s law. + Footnotes ^ Or, “woman subject to a husband.” ^ “Adulteress.” Lat., a·dulʹte·ra . ^ “Be slaves,” א AB; J 18 , “be servants to Jehovah.” ^ Or, “shall.” ^ Or, “will.” ^ Lit., “Callus-bearing.” Previous Next Print Share Share
