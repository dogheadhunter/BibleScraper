You, the one expressing abhorrence of the idols, do you rob + temples? 23 You, who take pride in law, do you by your transgressing of the Law + dishonor God? 24 For “the name of God is being blasphemed on account of YOU people among the nations”; + just as it is written. 25 Circumcision + is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; + but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision + has become uncircumcision. + 26 If, therefore, an uncircumcised + person keeps the righteous requirements + of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not? + 27 And the uncircumcised [person] that is such by nature will, by carrying out the Law, judge you + who with its written code and circumcision are a transgressor of law. 28 For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, + nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. + 29 But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, + and [his] circumcision is that of the heart + by spirit, and not by a written code. + The praise + of that one comes, not from men, but from God. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “change of mind.” ^ Or, “and test the things that differ.” ^ Lit., “form.” Gr., morʹpho·sin . ^ See 13:9 ftn.
