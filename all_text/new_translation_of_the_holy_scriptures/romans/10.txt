How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? + 15 How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent forth? + Just as it is written: “How comely are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!” + 16 Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. + For Isaiah says: “Jehovah, * who put faith in the thing heard from us?” + 17 So faith follows the thing heard. + In turn the thing heard is through the word about Christ. * + 18 Nevertheless I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, “into all the earth their sound went out, + and to the extremities * of the inhabited earth * their utterances.” + 19 Nevertheless I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? + First Moses says: “I will incite YOU people to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite YOU to violent anger through a stupid nation.” + 20 But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; + I became manifest to those who were not asking for me.” + 21 But as respects Israel he says: “All day long I have spread out my hands toward a people that is disobedient + and talks back.” + Footnotes ^ “I bear . . . witness.” Gr., mar·ty·roʹ; Lat., te·sti·moʹni·um . . . per·hiʹbe·o . ^ Or, “the accomplished (completed) end.” Gr., teʹlos . ^ Or, “we are heralding.” Gr., ke·rysʹso·men; Lat., prae·di·caʹmus .
