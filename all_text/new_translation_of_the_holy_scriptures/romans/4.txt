When he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? + Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 11 And he received a sign, + namely, circumcision, as a seal * of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, that he might be the father + of all those having faith + while in uncircumcision, in order for righteousness to be counted to them; 12 and a father of circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision, but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of that faith while in the uncircumcised state which our father + Abraham had. 13 For it was not through law that Abraham or his seed had the promise + that he should be heir of a world, but it was through the righteousness by faith. + 14 For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith has been made useless and the promise has been abolished. + 15 In reality the Law produces wrath, + but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression. + 16 On this account it was as a result of faith, that it might be according to undeserved kindness, + in order for the promise + to be sure to all his seed, + not only to that which adheres to the Law, but also to that which adheres to the faith of Abraham. (He is the father + of us all, 17 just as it is written: “I have appointed you a father of many nations.”) + This was in the sight of the One in whom he had faith, even of God, who makes the dead alive + and calls * the things that are not as though they were. + 18 Although beyond hope, yet based on hope he had faith, + that he might become the father of many nations + in accord with what had been said: “So your seed will be.” + 19 And, although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now already deadened, + as he was about one hundred years old, + also the deadness of the womb of Sarah. + 20 But because of the promise + of God he did not waver in a lack of faith, + but became powerful by his faith, + giving God glory 21 and being fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do. + 22 Hence “it was counted to him as righteousness.” + 23 That “it was counted + to him” was written, however, not for his sake only, + 24 but also for the sake of us to whom it is destined to be counted, because we believe on him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead. + 25 He was delivered up for the sake of our trespasses + and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous. + Footnotes ^ “Say about Abraham . . . flesh,” B; א ADVg, “say that Abraham our forefather according to the flesh has gained.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “is being reckoned.” Gr., lo·giʹze·tai; Lat., in·pu·taʹtur . ^ Or, “David also pronounces the felicitation.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “confirmation.” ^ Or, “summons.” Previous Next Print Share Share
