In showing honor + to one another take the lead. 11 Do not loiter at YOUR business. + Be aglow with the spirit. + Slave for Jehovah. * + 12 Rejoice in the hope. + Endure under tribulation. + Persevere in prayer. + 13 Share with the holy ones according to their needs. + Follow the course of hospitality. + 14 Keep on blessing those who persecute; + be blessing + and do not be cursing. + 15 Rejoice with people who rejoice; + weep with people who weep. 16 Be minded the same way toward others as to yourselves; + do not be minding lofty things, + but be led along with the lowly things. + Do not become discreet in YOUR own eyes. + 17 Return evil for evil + to no one. Provide fine things in the sight of all men. 18 If possible, as far as it depends upon YOU , be peaceable + with all men. 19 Do not avenge + yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; + for it is written: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.” * + 20 But, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; + for by doing this you will heap fiery coals upon his head.” + 21 Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good. + Footnotes ^ “A sacred service.” Gr., la·treiʹan; J 17 (Heb.), ʽavoh·dhath ·khemʹ, “your service ( worship ).” See Ex 12:25 ftn. ^ Or, “order of things.” Gr., ai·oʹni; Lat., saeʹcu·lo . ^ Or, “that acts as leader.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D .
