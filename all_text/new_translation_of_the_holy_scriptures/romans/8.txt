If God is for us, who will be * against us? + 32 He who did not even spare his own Son + but delivered him up for us all, + why will he not also with him kindly give us all other things? + 33 Who will file accusation against God’s chosen ones? + God is the One who declares [them] righteous. + 34 Who is he that will condemn? Christ Jesus * is the one who died, yes, rather the one who was raised up from the dead, * who is on the right hand + of God, who also pleads for us. + 35 Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? * + Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword? + 36 Just as it is written: “For your sake we are being put to death all day long, we have been accounted as sheep for slaughtering.” + 37 To the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious + through him that loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life + nor angels + nor governments + nor things now here nor things to come nor powers + 39 nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. + Footnotes ^ “Of adoption as sons.” Lit., “of placing as son.” Gr., hui·o·the·siʹas; Lat., a·do·pti·oʹnis fi·li·oʹrum . ^ “Abba.” An Aram. word meaning “the father,” or, “O Father!” ^ Or, “because.” ^ “Adoption as sons,” א ABCVgSy h,p ; P 46 D omit. ^ Or, “that cannot be uttered.” ^ Or, “mind; thought.” ^ “God,” P 46 AB; א CDVgSy p omit. ^ Or, “whom he foreknew.” ^ Lit., “he defined beforehand.” ^ Or, “is; can be.” ^ “Jesus,” א AC; BDSy p omit. ^ “From the dead,” AC; P 46 BDVgSy p omit. ^ “The Christ,” ACDItVgSy h,p ; א , “God”; B, “God that is in Christ Jesus.” Previous Next Print Share Share
