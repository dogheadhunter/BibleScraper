+ but just as it is written: “The reproaches of those who were reproaching you have fallen upon me.” + 4 For all the things that were written aforetime were written + for our instruction, + that through our endurance + and through the comfort + from the Scriptures we might have hope. * + 5 Now may the God who supplies endurance and comfort grant YOU to have among yourselves the same mental attitude + that Christ Jesus had, 6 that with one accord + YOU may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 7 Therefore welcome one another, + just as the Christ also welcomed us, + with glory to God in view. 8 For I say that Christ actually became a minister + of those who are circumcised + in behalf of God’s truthfulness, + so as to verify the promises + He made to their forefathers, 9 and that the nations + might glorify God for his mercy. + Just as it is written: “That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations * and to your name I will make melody.” + 10 And again he says: “Be glad, YOU nations, with his people.” + 11 And again: “Praise Jehovah, * all YOU nations, and let all the peoples praise him.” + 12 And again Isaiah says: “There will be the root of Jesʹse, + and there will be one arising to rule nations; + on him nations will rest their hope.” + 13 May the God who gives hope fill YOU with all joy and peace by YOUR believing, that YOU may abound in hope with power of holy spirit. + 14 Now I myself also am persuaded about YOU , my brothers, that YOU yourselves are also full of goodness, as YOU have been filled with all knowledge, + and that YOU can also admonish one another. + 15 However, I am writing YOU the more outspokenly on some points, as if reminding + YOU again, because of the undeserved kindness given to me from God + 16 for me to be a public servant * of Christ Jesus to the nations, + engaging in the holy work of the good news + of God, in order that the offering, + namely, these nations, might prove to be acceptable, + it being sanctified with holy spirit. + 17 Therefore I have cause for exulting in Christ Jesus + when it comes to things pertaining to God. + 18 For I will not venture to tell one thing if it is not of those things which Christ worked through me + for the nations to be obedient, + by [my] word + and deed, 19 with the power of signs and portents, + with the power of holy spirit; * so that from Jerusalem and in a circuit + as far as Il·lyrʹi·cum I have thoroughly preached the good news about the Christ. + 20 In this way, indeed, I made it my aim not to declare the good news where Christ had already been named, in order that I might not be building on another man’s foundation; + 21 but, just as it is written: “Those to whom no announcement has been made about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.” + 22 Therefore also I was many times hindered from getting to YOU . + 23 But now that I no longer have [untouched] territory in these regions, and for some years having had a longing to get to YOU + 24 whenever I am on my way to Spain, + I hope, above all, when I am on the journey there, to get a look at YOU and to be escorted + partway there by YOU after I have first in some measure been satisfied with your company. 25 But now I am about to journey to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones. + 26 For those in Mac·e·doʹni·a and A·chaʹia * + have been pleased to share up their things by a contribution + to the poor of the holy ones in Jerusalem. 27 True, they have been pleased to do so, and yet they were debtors to them; for if the nations have shared in their spiritual things, + they also owe it to minister publicly to these with things for the fleshly body. + 28 Hence after I have finished with this and have got this fruit + securely to them, I shall depart by way of YOU for Spain. + 29 Moreover, I know that when I do come to YOU I shall come with a full measure of blessing from Christ. + 30 Now I exhort YOU , brothers, * through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the spirit, + that YOU exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me, + 31 that I may be delivered + from the unbelievers in Ju·deʹa and that my ministry which is for Jerusalem + may prove to be acceptable to the holy ones, + 32 so that when I get to YOU with joy by God’s will I shall be refreshed + together with YOU . 33 May the God who gives peace be with all of YOU . + Amen.
