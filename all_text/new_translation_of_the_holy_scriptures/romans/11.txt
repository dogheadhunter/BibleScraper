For I also am an Israelite, + of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. + 2 God did not reject his people, whom he first recognized. * + Why, do YOU not know what the Scripture says in connection with E·liʹjah, as he pleads with God against Israel? + 3 “Jehovah, * they have killed your prophets, they have dug up your altars, and I alone am left, and they are looking for my soul.” * + 4 Yet, what does the divine pronouncement + say to him? “I have left seven thousand men over for myself, [men] who have not bent the knee to Baʹal.” + 5 In this way, therefore, at the present season also a remnant + has turned up according to a choosing + due to undeserved kindness. 6 Now if it is by undeserved kindness, + it is no longer due to works; + otherwise, the undeserved kindness no longer proves to be undeserved kindness. + 7 What, then? The very thing Israel is earnestly seeking he did not obtain, + but the ones chosen * + obtained it. The rest had their sensibilities blunted; + 8 just as it is written: “God * has given them a spirit of deep sleep, + eyes so as not to see and ears so as not to hear, down to this very day.” + 9 Also, David says: “Let their table * become for them a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and a retribution; + 10 let their eyes become darkened so as not to see, and always bow down their back.” + 11 Therefore I ask, Did they stumble so that they fell + completely? Never may that happen! But by their false step + there is salvation to people of the nations, + to incite them to jealousy. + 12 Now if their false step means riches to the world, and their decrease means riches to people of the nations, + how much more will the full number * + of them mean it! 13 Now I speak to YOU who are people of the nations. Forasmuch as I am, in reality, an apostle + to the nations, + I glorify + my ministry, + 14 if I may by any means incite [those who are] my own flesh to jealousy and save + some from among them. + 15 For if the casting of them away + means reconciliation + for the world, what will the receiving of them mean but life from the dead? 16 Further, if the [part taken as] firstfruits + is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, + the branches are also. 17 However, if some of the branches were broken off but you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them + and became a sharer of the olive’s + root of fatness, + 18 do not be exulting over the branches. If, though, you are exulting over them, + it is not you that bear the root, + but the root [bears] you. + 19 You will say, then: “Branches were broken off + that I might be grafted in.” + 20 All right! For [their] lack of faith + they were broken off, but you are standing by faith. + Quit having lofty ideas, + but be in fear. + 21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. + 22 See, therefore, God’s kindness + and severity. + Toward those who fell there is severity, + but toward you there is God’s kindness, provided you remain + in his kindness; otherwise, you also will be lopped off. + 23 They also, if they do not remain in their lack of faith, will be grafted in; + for God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut out of the olive tree that is wild by nature and were grafted + contrary to nature into the garden olive tree, how much rather will these who are natural be grafted into their own olive tree! + 25 For I do not want YOU , brothers, to be ignorant of this sacred secret, + in order for YOU not to be discreet in your own eyes: that a dulling of sensibilities + has happened in part to Israel until the full number * + of people of the nations has come in, + 26 and in this manner all Israel + will be saved. Just as it is written: “The deliverer will come out of Zion + and turn away ungodly practices from Jacob. + 27 And this is the covenant on my part with them, when I take their sins away.” + 28 True, with reference to the good news they are enemies for YOUR sakes, + but with reference to [God’s] choosing * they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. + 29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not things he will regret. + 30 For just as YOU were once disobedient + to God but have now been shown mercy + because of their disobedience, + 31 so also these now have been disobedient with mercy resulting to YOU , + that they themselves also may now be shown mercy. 32 For God has shut them all up together in disobedience, + that he might show all of them mercy. + 33 O the depth of God’s riches + and wisdom + and knowledge! + How unsearchable his judgments + [are] and past tracing out his ways [are]! 34 For “who has come to know Jehovah’s * mind, + or who has become his counselor?” + 35 Or, “Who has first given to him, so that it must be repaid to him?” + 36 Because from him and by him and for him are all things. + To him be the glory forever. + Amen.
