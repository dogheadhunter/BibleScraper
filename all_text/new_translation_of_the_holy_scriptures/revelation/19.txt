Praise Jah, + YOU people!” * 5 Also, a voice issued forth from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all YOU his slaves, + who fear him, the small ones and the great.” + 6 And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many * waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, + YOU people, * because Jehovah * our * God, the Almighty, + has begun to rule as king. + 7 Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, + because the marriage + of the Lamb has arrived + and his wife has prepared herself. + 8 Yes, it has been granted to her to be arrayed in bright, clean, fine linen, for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.” + 9 And he tells me: “Write: Happy are those invited * + to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” * + Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.” + 10 At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. + But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! + All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus. + Worship God; + for the bearing witness * to Jesus is what inspires * prophesying.” * + 11 And I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. + And the one seated upon it is called * Faithful + and True, + and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. + 12 His eyes are a fiery flame, + and upon his head are many diadems. + He has a name + written that no one knows but he himself, 13 and he is arrayed with an outer garment sprinkled with blood, + and the name he is called is The Word + of God. 14 Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. 15 And out of his mouth there protrudes a sharp long sword, + that he may strike the nations with it, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. + He treads too the winepress + of the anger of the wrath of God + the Almighty. 16 And upon his outer garment, even upon his thigh, he has a name written, King of * kings and Lord of lords. + 17 I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds + that fly in midheaven: “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God, 18 that YOU may eat the fleshy + parts of kings and the fleshy parts of military commanders * and the fleshy parts of strong men + and the fleshy parts of horses + and of those seated upon them, and the fleshy parts of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.” 19 And I saw the wild beast + and the kings + of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage the war + with the one seated on the horse + and with his army. 20 And the wild beast + was caught, and along with it the false prophet + that performed in front of it the signs + with which he misled those who received the mark + of the wild beast and those who render worship to its image. + While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulphur. + 21 But the rest were killed off with the long sword of the one seated on the horse, + which [sword] proceeded out of his mouth. + And all the birds + were filled + from the fleshy parts of them. + Footnotes ^ “Our God,” א ACVgSy h ; TR and some cursive mss, “the Lord our God”; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16,​17 , “Jehovah our God.” ^ Or, “Hallelujah.” Gr., Hal·le·lou·i·aʹ; J 22 (Heb.), ha·lelu·yahʹ .
