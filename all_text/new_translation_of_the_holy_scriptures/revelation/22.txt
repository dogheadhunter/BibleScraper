And on this side of the river and on that side [there were] trees * + of life producing twelve crops of fruit, yielding their fruits each month. + And the leaves of the trees [were] for the curing of the nations. + 3 And no more will there be any curse. + But the throne of God + and of the Lamb + will be in [the city], * and his slaves will render him sacred service; * + 4 and they will see his face, + and his name will be on their foreheads. + 5 Also, night will be no more, + and they have no need of lamplight nor [do they have] sunlight, because Jehovah * God will shed light + upon them, and they will rule as kings forever and ever. + 6 And he said to me: “These words are faithful and true; + yes, Jehovah * the God of the inspired expressions * + of the prophets + sent his angel forth to show his slaves the things that must shortly take place. + 7 And, look! I am coming quickly. + Happy is anyone observing the words of the prophecy of this scroll.” + 8 Well, I John was the one hearing and seeing these things. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship + before the feet of the angel that had been showing me these things. 9 But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who are prophets + and of those who are observing the words of this scroll. Worship God.” + 10 He also tells me: “Do not seal up * the words of the prophecy of this scroll, for the appointed time is near. + 11 He that is doing unrighteousness, let him do unrighteousness still; + and let the filthy one be made filthy still; + but let the righteous + one do righteousness still, and let the holy one be made holy still. + 12 “‘Look! I am coming quickly, + and the reward + I give is with me, to render to each one as his work is. + 13 I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, * + the first and the last, + the beginning and the end. 14 Happy are those who wash their robes, + that the authority [to go] to the trees * of life + may be theirs and that they may gain entrance into the city by its gates. + 15 Outside are the dogs + and those who practice spiritism * + and the fornicators + and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone liking and carrying on a lie.’ + 16 “‘I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to YOU people of these things for the congregations. I am the root + and the offspring + of David, and the bright morning star.’” + 17 And the spirit * + and the bride + keep on saying: “Come!” And let anyone hearing say: “Come!” + And let anyone thirsting come; + let anyone that wishes take life’s water free. + 18 “I am bearing witness to everyone that hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone makes an addition + to these things, God will add to him the plagues + that are written in this scroll; 19 and if anyone takes anything away from the words of the scroll of this prophecy, God will take his portion away from the trees of life + and out of the holy city, + things which are written about in this scroll. 20 “He that bears witness of these things says, ‘Yes; I am coming quickly.’” + “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.” 21 [May] the undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ * [be] with the holy ones. * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “tree” (generically); or, “wood.” Gr., xyʹlon . ^ Or, “it,” fem., that is, the city. ^ “Will render . . . sacred service.” Gr., la·treuʹsou·sin .
