And there occurred a hail and fire + mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned + up, and a third of the trees was burned up, and all the green vegetation + was burned up. 8 And the second angel blew his trumpet. And something like a great mountain + burning with fire was hurled into the sea. + And a third of the sea became blood; + 9 and a third of the creatures that are in the sea which have souls * died, + and a third of the boats were wrecked. 10 And the third angel blew his trumpet. And a great star burning as a lamp fell from heaven, + and it fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters. + 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood. * And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the men * died from the waters, because these had been made bitter. + 12 And the fourth angel blew his trumpet. And a third of the sun was smitten * and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened + and the day might not have illumination for a third + of it, and the night likewise. 13 And I saw, and I heard an eagle + flying in midheaven * + say with a loud voice: “Woe, woe, woe + to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!” + Footnotes ^ Or, “lives.” Gr., psy·khasʹ; Lat., aʹni·mas . ^ Or, “Absinthe.” ^ Or, “of mankind.” ^ Or, “was eclipsed.” ^ Or, “in the meridian; directly overhead.” Previous Next Print Share Share
