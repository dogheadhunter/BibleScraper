I have set before you an opened door, + which no one can shut—that you have a little power, and you kept my word and did not prove false to my name. + 9 Look! I will give those from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, + and yet they are not but are lying + —look! I will make them come and do obeisance + before your feet and make them know I have loved you. 10 Because you kept the word about my endurance, * + I will also keep + you from the hour of test, * which is to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to put a test upon those dwelling on the earth. + 11 I am coming quickly. + Keep on holding fast what you have, + that no one may take your crown. + 12 “‘The one that conquers—I will make him a pillar + in the temple * + of my God, + and he will by no means go out [from it] anymore, and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem * + which descends out of heaven from my God, and that new name of mine. + 13 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit + says to the congregations.’ 14 “And to the angel of the congregation in La·o·di·ceʹa + write: These are the things that the Amen * + says, the faithful + and true + witness, + the beginning of the creation by God, + 15 ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or else hot. 16 So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot + nor cold, + I am going to vomit * you out of my mouth. 17 Because you say: “I am rich + and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,” but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind + and naked, 18 I advise you to buy from me gold + refined by fire that you may become rich, and white outer garments that you may become dressed and that the shame of your nakedness may not become manifested, + and eyesalve to rub in your eyes + that you may see. 19 “‘All those for whom I have affection I reprove and discipline. + Therefore be zealous and repent. + 20 Look! I am standing at the door + and knocking. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, + I will come into his [house] and take the evening meal with him and he with me. 21 To the one that conquers + I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, + even as I conquered and sat down + with my Father on his throne. + 22 Let the one who has an ear hear what the spirit + says to the congregations.’” + Footnotes ^ Or, “persons.” ^ Lit., “the hour of the temptation.” ^ Or, “kept what I said about endurance.” ^ “Jerusalem,” meaning “Possession [or, Foundation] of Twofold Peace.” ^ Or, “divine habitation (dwelling).” Gr., na·oiʹ, dative, sing.; Lat., temʹplo; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), be heh·khalʹ , “in the palace ( temple ) of.” ^ “The Amen.” Gr., ho A·menʹ; Lat., Aʹmen; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha·ʼA·menʹ, “the So Be It.” ^ “I am going to vomit,” AVgSy h ; א , “keep [your mouth] still!” Previous Next Print Share Share
