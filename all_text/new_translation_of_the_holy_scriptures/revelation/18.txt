Babylon * the Great has fallen, + and she has become a dwelling place of demons and a lurking place of every unclean exhalation * + and a lurking place of every unclean and hated bird! + 3 For because of the wine of the anger of her fornication * all the nations have fallen [victim], + and the kings of the earth committed fornication + with her, and the traveling merchants + of the earth became rich due to the power of her shameless luxury.” + 4 And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, + if YOU do not want to share with her in her sins, + and if YOU do not want to receive part of her plagues. 5 For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, + and God has called her acts of injustice to mind. + 6 Render to her even as she herself rendered, + and do to her twice as much, yes, twice the number of the things she did; + in the cup + in which she put a mixture put twice + as much of the mixture for her. + 7 To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. + For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, + and I am no widow, + and I shall never see mourning.’ + 8 That is why in one day her plagues + will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, + because Jehovah * God, who judged her, is strong. + 9 “And the kings + of the earth who committed fornication with her and lived in shameless luxury will weep and beat themselves in grief over her, + when they look at the smoke + from the burning of her, 10 while they stand at a distance because of their fear of her torment and say, + ‘Too bad, too bad, you great city, + Babylon you strong city, because in one hour your judgment has arrived!’ + 11 “Also, the traveling merchants + of the earth are weeping and mourning over her, + because there is no one to buy their full stock anymore, 12 a full stock + of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet; and everything in scented wood * and every sort of ivory object and every sort of object out of most precious wood and of copper and of iron and of marble; + 13 also cinnamon and Indian spice * and incense and perfumed oil and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and horses and coaches and slaves * and human souls. * + 14 Yes, the fine fruit that your soul desired * + has departed from you, and all the dainty things and the gorgeous things have perished from you, and never again will people find them. + 15 “The traveling merchants + of these things, who became rich from her, will stand at a distance because of [their] fear of her torment and will weep and mourn, + 16 saying, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, + clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet, and richly adorned with gold ornament and precious stone and pearl, + 17 because in one hour such great riches have been devastated!’ + “And every ship captain and every man that voyages anywhere, + and sailors and all those who make a living by the sea, stood at a distance + 18 and cried out as they looked at the smoke from the burning of her and said, ‘What city is like the great city?’ + 19 And they threw dust upon their heads + and cried out, weeping and mourning, + and said, ‘Too bad, too bad—the great city, in which all those having boats at sea + became rich + by reason of her costliness, because in one hour she has been devastated!’ + 20 “Be glad over her, O heaven, + also YOU holy ones + and YOU apostles + and YOU prophets, because God has judicially exacted punishment for YOU from her!” + 21 And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone + and hurled it into the sea, + saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again. + 22 And the sound of singers who accompany themselves on the harp and of musicians and of flutists and of trumpeters will never be heard in you again, + and no craftsman of any trade * will ever be found in you again, and no sound of a millstone will ever be heard in you again, 23 and no light of a lamp will ever shine in you again, and no voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will ever be heard in you again; + because your traveling merchants + were the top-ranking men + of the earth, for by your spiritistic + practice * all the nations were misled. 24 Yes, in her was found the blood + of prophets + and of holy ones + and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.” + Footnotes ^ Gr., Ba·by·lonʹ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), Ba·velʹ . ^ Or, “spirit.” ^ Or, “For because of the passion-arousing wine of her fornication.” A omits “of the wine.” ^ “Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16-18,​22-24 ; א c CSy h (Gr.), Kyʹri·os; AVg omit.
