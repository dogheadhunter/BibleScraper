Look! The third woe is coming quickly. 15 And the seventh angel blew his trumpet. + And loud voices occurred in heaven, saying: “The kingdom of the world * did become the kingdom of our Lord + and of his Christ, + and he will rule as king * forever and ever.” + 16 And the twenty-four elders * + who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces + and worshiped God, + 17 saying: “We thank you, + Jehovah * God, the Almighty, + the One who is + and who was, because you have taken your great power + and begun ruling as king. + 18 But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give [their] reward + to your slaves the prophets + and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, + and to bring to ruin + those ruining * the earth.” + 19 And the temple [sanctuary] * of God * that is in heaven + was opened, and the ark + of his covenant was seen in his temple [sanctuary]. + And there occurred lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail.
