And she cries out in her pains + and in her agony to give birth. 3 And another sign was seen in heaven, and, look! a great fiery-colored dragon, + with seven heads and ten horns and upon its heads seven diadems; 4 and its tail + drags a third of the stars + of heaven, and it hurled them down to the earth. + And the dragon * kept standing before the woman + who was about to give birth, + that, when she did give birth, it might devour + her child. 5 And she gave birth to a son, + a male, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. + And her child was caught away to God and to his throne. + 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, + where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed + her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days. + 7 And war broke out in heaven: Miʹcha·el * + and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled 8 but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. 9 So down the great dragon + was hurled, the original serpent, + the one called Devil + and Satan, + who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; * + he was hurled down to the earth, + and his angels were hurled down with him. 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come to pass the salvation * + and the power * + and the kingdom of our God + and the authority * of his Christ, + because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! + 11 And they conquered him + because of the blood of the Lamb + and because of the word of their witnessing, + and they did not love their souls * + even in the face of death. * 12 On this account be glad, YOU heavens and YOU who reside in them! + Woe + for the earth and for the sea, + because the Devil has come down to YOU , having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” + 13 Now when the dragon saw that it was hurled down to the earth, + it persecuted the woman + that gave birth to the male child. 14 But the two wings of the great eagle + were given the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness + to her place; there is where she is fed + for a time and times and half a time * + away from the face of the serpent. + 15 And the serpent disgorged water + like a river from its mouth after the woman, to cause her to be drowned by the river. + 16 But the earth came to the woman’s help, + and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon disgorged from its mouth. 17 And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, + and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness * + to Jesus.
