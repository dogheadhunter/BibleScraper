And he set his right foot upon the sea, but his left one upon the earth, + 3 and he cried out with a loud voice just as when a lion + roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders + uttered their own voices. 4 Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was at the point of writing; but I heard a voice out of heaven + say: “Seal up * the things + the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them down.” 5 And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, + 6 and by the One who lives + forever and ever, + who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth + and the things in it and the sea and the things in it, * + he swore: “There will be no delay * + any longer; 7 but in the days of the sounding * of the seventh angel, + when he is about to blow his trumpet, + the sacred secret * + of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets + is indeed brought to a finish.” 8 And the voice + that I heard out of heaven is speaking again with me and saying: “Go, take the opened scroll that is in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth.” + 9 And I went away to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me: “Take it and eat it up, + and it will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” 10 And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel and ate it up, + and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; + but when I had eaten it up, my belly was made bitter. 11 And they say to me: “You must prophesy again with regard to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “stepping down.” ^ Lit., “little booklet.” Gr., bi·bla·riʹdi·on . ^ Or, “Keep secret.” ^ Lit., “time.” Gr., khroʹnos . ^ “And the sea and the things in it,” P 47 א c CVg; א * A omit. ^ Or, “voice.” Gr., pho·nesʹ . ^ Or, “the mystery.” Gr., to my·steʹri·on .
