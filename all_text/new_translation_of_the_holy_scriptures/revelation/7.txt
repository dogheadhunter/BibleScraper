The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power + and the strength [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen.” * + 13 And in response one of the elders + said to me: “These who are dressed in the white robes, + who are they and where did they come from?” 14 So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one that knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, + and they have washed their robes and made them white + in the blood + of the Lamb. 15 That is why they are before + the throne of God; and they are rendering him sacred service * + day and night in his temple; * and the One seated on the throne + will spread his tent + over them. 16 They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down upon them nor any scorching heat, + 17 because the Lamb, + who is in the midst of the throne, will shepherd + them, and will guide them to fountains of waters + of life. And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “quarters; extremities.” ^ Lit., “You should not treat unrighteously.” ^ Lit., “(ones) having been sealed.” ^ “Gad.” א omits. ^ “Simeon.” א omits. ^ Gr., ethʹnous, “ethnic group”; Lat., genʹti·bus, “Gentiles”; J 17,​18 (Heb.), hag· goh·yimʹ , “the nations ( goyim ).” ^ Lit., “The salvation .” Gr., He so·te·riʹa ; Lat., saʹlus ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha· yeshu·ʽahʹ . ^ Gr., pre·sby·teʹron . ^ “Amen.” C omits. ^ “They are rendering . . . sacred service.” Gr., la·treuʹou·sin; J 22 (Heb.), we ʽoh·vedhimʹ , “and they are serving ( worshiping ).” Compare Ex 3:12 ftn. ^ Or, “divine habitation (dwelling).” Gr., na·oiʹ, dative, sing.; Lat., temʹplo; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), be heh·kha·l ohʹ, “in his palace ( temple ).” Previous Next Print Share Share
