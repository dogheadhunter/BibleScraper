Babylon + the Great has fallen, + she who made all the nations drink of the wine + of the anger of her fornication!” * + 9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the wild beast + and its image, + and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand, + 10 he will also drink of the wine of the anger of God that is poured out undiluted into the cup of his wrath, + and he shall be tormented + with fire and sulphur + in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb. 11 And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever, + and day and night they have no rest, those who worship the wild beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark + of its name. 12 Here is where it means endurance for the holy ones, + those who observe the commandments of God + and the faith + of Jesus.” 13 And I heard a voice out of heaven say: “Write: Happy are the dead + who die in union with [the] Lord + from this time onward. + Yes, says the spirit, let them rest * from their labors, for the things they did * go right with them.” 14 And I saw, and, look! a white cloud, and upon the cloud someone seated like a son of man, + with a golden crown + on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 15 And another angel emerged from the temple [sanctuary], * crying with a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud: “Put your sickle in and reap, + because the hour has come to reap, for the harvest + of the earth is thoroughly ripe.” * + 16 And the one seated on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. 17 And still another angel emerged from the temple [sanctuary] * that is in heaven, + he, too, having a sharp sickle. 18 And still another angel emerged from the altar and he had authority over the fire. + And he called out with a loud voice to the one that had the sharp sickle, saying: “Put your sharp sickle in and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, + because its grapes have become ripe.” 19 And the angel + thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine + of the earth, and he hurled it into the great winepress of the anger of God. + 20 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, + and blood came out of the winepress as high up as the bridles of the horses, + for a distance of a thousand six hundred furlongs. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “great.” ^ Or, “learn fully.” ^ Gr., pre·sby·teʹron . ^ Or, “in the meridian; directly overhead.” ^ “Angel,” א c ACSy h ; P 47 א * omit. ^ See App 5A . ^ “The things they did.” Lit., “their works.” ^ Or, “that they may rest.” ^ Or, “the divine habitation (dwelling).” Gr., tou na·ouʹ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha· heh·khalʹ , “the palace ( temple ).” ^ Or, “is dried out.” ^ See vs 15 ftn, “Sanctuary.” ^ About 296 km (184 English mi).
