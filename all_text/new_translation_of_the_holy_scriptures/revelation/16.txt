And they became blood. + 5 And I heard the angel over the waters say: “You, * the One who is and who was, + the loyal + One, are righteous, because you have rendered these decisions, + 6 because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, + and you have given them blood + to drink. They deserve it.” + 7 And I heard the altar say: “Yes, Jehovah * God, the Almighty, + true and righteous are your judicial decisions.” + 8 And the fourth one + poured out his bowl upon the sun; and to [the sun] * it was granted to scorch + the men * with fire. 9 And the men were scorched with great heat, but they blasphemed the name + of God, who has the authority + over these plagues, and they did not repent so as to give glory + to him. 10 And the fifth one poured out his bowl upon the throne of the wild beast. + And its kingdom became darkened, + and they began to gnaw their tongues for [their] pain, 11 but they blasphemed + the God of heaven for their pains and for their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works. 12 And the sixth one + poured out his bowl upon the great river Eu·phraʹtes, + and its water was dried up, + that the way might be prepared for the kings + from the rising of the sun. 13 And I saw three unclean inspired expressions * + [that looked] like frogs + come out of the mouth of the dragon + and out of the mouth of the wild beast + and out of the mouth of the false prophet. * + 14 They are, in fact, expressions inspired + by * demons and perform signs, + and they go forth to the kings + of the entire inhabited earth, * + to gather them together to the war + of the great day + of God the Almighty. + 15 “Look! I am * coming as a thief. + Happy is the one that stays awake + and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness.” + 16 And they gathered them together to the place * that is called in Hebrew Har–Ma·gedʹon. * + 17 And the seventh one poured out his bowl upon the air. + At this a loud voice + issued out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying: “It has come to pass!” 18 And lightnings and voices and thunders occurred, and a great earthquake + occurred such as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth, + so extensive an earthquake, + so great. 19 And the great city + split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and Babylon * the Great + was remembered in the sight of God, to give her the cup of the wine of the anger of his wrath. + 20 Also, every island fled, and mountains were not found. + 21 And a great hail + with every stone about the weight of a talent * descended out of heaven upon the men, * and the men blasphemed + God due to the plague of hail, + because the plague of it was unusually great.
