After these things he must be let loose for a little while. + 4 And I saw thrones, + and there were those who sat down on them, and power of judging was given them. + Yes, I saw the souls of those executed with the ax for the witness they bore to Jesus and for speaking about God, * and those who had worshiped neither the wild beast + nor its image + and who had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand. + And they came to life and ruled as kings + with the Christ for a thousand years. * 5 (The rest of the dead + did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) * + This is the first + resurrection. * 6 Happy + and holy + is anyone having part in the first resurrection; over these the second death + has no authority, + but they will be priests + of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years. + 7 Now as soon as the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison, 8 and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners * of the earth, Gog and Maʹgog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea. + 9 And they advanced over the breadth of the earth and encircled the camp * of the holy ones + and the beloved city. + But fire came down out of heaven and devoured them. + 10 And the Devil + who was misleading * them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur, where both the wild beast + and the false prophet [already were]; + and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. 11 And I saw a great white throne and the one seated on it. + From before him * the earth and the heaven fled away, + and no place was found for them. 12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, + standing before the throne, and scrolls * were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. + And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds. + 13 And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Haʹdes * gave up those dead + in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds. + 14 And death + and Haʹdes were hurled into the lake of fire. * This means * the second death, + the lake of fire. + 15 Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life + was hurled into the lake of fire. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “through the witness of Jesus and through the word of the God.” ^ “Thousand years.” Gr., khiʹli·a eʹte, root for the English word “chiliasts,” believers in a literal thousand-year reign of Christ over mankind on a paradise earth; Lat., milʹle anʹnis, “a millennium.” ^ “Resurrection.” Gr., a·naʹsta·sis, “raising up; standing up” (from a·naʹ, “up,” and staʹsis, “standing”); Lat., re·sur·recʹti·o . ^ “The rest of the dead . . . were ended,” AVg; א Sy p omit. ^ Or, “quarters; extremities.” Compare 7:1 . ^ Or, “the army in battle line.” Lit., “encampment.” ^ Lit., “making to err.” ^ Or, “From the face of him.” ^ Lit., “little books.” Gr., bi·bliʹa . ^ “Hades.” Gr., haiʹdes; Vg(Lat.), inʹfe·rus; Vg c​ (Lat.), in·ferʹnus; Sy h J 7,​8,​11-14,​16-18,​22 , “Sheol.” See App 4B . ^ See App 4C . ^ Or, “is.” Previous Next Print Share Share
