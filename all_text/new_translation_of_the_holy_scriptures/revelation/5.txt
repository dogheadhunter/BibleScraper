Look! The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, + the root + of David, + has conquered + so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.” 6 And I saw standing in the midst of the throne + and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders + a lamb + as though it had been slaughtered, + having seven horns and seven eyes, which [eyes] mean * the seven * spirits + of God that * have been sent forth into the whole earth. 7 And he went and at once took [it] out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne. + 8 And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders + fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp + and golden bowls that were full of incense, and the [incense] + means * the prayers + of the holy ones. 9 And they sing a new song, + saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood + you bought + persons for God + out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, 10 and you made them to be a kingdom + and priests + to our God, + and they are to rule as kings * + over * the earth.” 11 And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads * + and thousands of thousands, + 12 saying with a loud voice: “The Lamb that was slaughtered + is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.” + 13 And every creature that is in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth + and on the sea, and all the things in them, I heard saying: “To the One sitting on the throne + and to the Lamb + be the blessing and the honor + and the glory + and the might forever and ever.” 14 And the four living creatures went saying: “Amen!” and the elders + fell down and worshiped. + Footnotes ^ Or, “great.” ^ “That,” א Vg, referring to the “seven spirits”; A, “and which,” referring to the “eyes.” ^ “Seven,” א Vg c Sy h ; AVg omit. ^ Or, “are.” ^ “The [incense] means,” א and Minuscule ms 046; A, “the [bowls] mean.” ^ “Over.” Gr., e·piʹ, with the genitive, as in 9:11; 11:6 . ^ “They are to rule as kings; they rule as kings,” ASy h and Minuscule ms 046; א Vg, “they will rule as kings.” ^ Or, “ten thousand times tens of thousands.” Previous Next Print Share Share
