And the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots + of many horses running into battle. + 10 Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; + and in their tails is their authority to hurt * the men five months. 11 They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. + In Hebrew his name is A·badʹdon, * but in Greek he has the name A·polʹlyon. * + 12 The one woe is past. Look! Two more woes + are coming after these things. * 13 And the sixth angel + blew his trumpet. + And I heard one voice + out of the horns * of the golden altar + that is before God 14 say to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet: “Untie the four angels + that are bound + at the great river Eu·phraʹtes.” + 15 And the four angels were untied, who have been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, to kill a third of the men. 16 And the number of the armies of cavalry * was two myriads of myriads: * I heard the number of them. 17 And this is how I saw the horses in the vision, and those seated on them: they had fire-red and hyacinth-blue and sulphur-yellow breastplates; and the heads of the horses were as heads of lions, + and out of their mouths fire and smoke and sulphur + issued forth. 18 By these three plagues a third of the men were killed, from the fire and the smoke and the sulphur which issued forth from their mouths. 19 For the authority of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents + and have heads, and with these they do harm. 20 But the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, + so that they should not worship the demons + and the idols of gold and silver + and copper and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk; + 21 and they did not repent of their murders + nor of their spiritistic practices * + nor of their fornication nor of their thefts.
