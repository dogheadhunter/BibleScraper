And Haʹdes * + was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword + and with food shortage * + and with deadly plague * and by the wild beasts + of the earth. 9 And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar + the souls + of those slaughtered + because of the word of God and * because of the witness + work * that they used to have. 10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying: “Until when, Sovereign + Lord * holy and true, + are you refraining from judging + and avenging our blood + upon those who dwell on the earth?” 11 And a white + robe was given to each of them; and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number was filled also of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed + as they also had been. 12 And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred; and the sun became black as sackcloth + of hair, and the entire moon became as blood, + 13 and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as when a fig tree shaken by a high wind casts its unripe figs. 14 And the heaven departed as a scroll that is being rolled up, + and every mountain and [every] island were removed from their places. + 15 And the kings of the earth and the top-ranking ones and the military commanders * and the rich and the strong ones and every slave and [every] free person hid themselves in the caves and in the rock-masses + of the mountains. 16 And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rock-masses: “Fall over us + and hide us from the face of the One seated on the throne + and from the wrath of the Lamb, + 17 because the great day + of their wrath + has come, and who is able to stand?” + Footnotes ^ Gr., Khoiʹnix .
