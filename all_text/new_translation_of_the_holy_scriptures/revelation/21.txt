The tent * + of God is with mankind, and he will reside * + with them, and they will be his peoples. + And God himself will be with them. + 4 And he will wipe out every tear + from their eyes, and death will be no more, + neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. + The former things have passed away.” + 5 And the One seated on the throne + said: “Look! I am making all things new.” + Also, he says: “Write, because these words are faithful and true.” 6 And he said to me: “They have come to pass! * I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga, * the beginning and the end. + To anyone thirsting I will give from the fountain of the water of life free. + 7 Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God + and he will be my son. + 8 But as for the cowards and those without faith + and those who are disgusting in their filth + and murderers + and fornicators + and those practicing spiritism * and idolaters + and all the liars, + their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire + and sulphur. + This means * the second death.” + 9 And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls which were full of the seven last plagues, + and he spoke with me and said: “Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb’s wife.” + 10 So he carried me away in [the power of the] spirit to a great and lofty mountain, + and he showed me the holy city + Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God + 11 and having the glory of God. + Its radiance * was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone shining crystal-clear. + 12 It had a great and lofty wall + and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. + 13 On the east were three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. + 14 The wall of the city also had twelve foundation + stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles + of the Lamb. 15 Now the one who was speaking with me was holding as a measure a golden reed, + that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall. + 16 And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city + with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; * its length and breadth and height are equal. 17 Also, he measured its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, * according to a man’s measure, at the same time an angel’s. * 18 Now the structure of its wall was jasper, + and the city was pure gold like clear glass. 19 The foundations + of the city’s wall were adorned with every sort of precious stone: + the first foundation was jasper, + the second sapphire, + the third chal·cedʹo·ny, the fourth emerald, + 20 the fifth sarʹdo·nyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysʹo·lite, + the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, + the tenth chrysʹo·prase, the eleventh hyacinth, the twelfth amethyst. + 21 Also, the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was made of one pearl. + And the broad way of the city was pure gold, as transparent glass. 22 And I did not see a temple * in it, + for Jehovah * + God the Almighty * + is its temple, + also the Lamb [is]. + 23 And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God lighted it up, + and its lamp was the Lamb. + 24 And the nations will walk by means of its light, + and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. + 25 And its gates will not be closed at all by day, + for night will not exist there. + 26 And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it. + 27 But anything not sacred and anyone that carries on a disgusting + thing and a lie + will in no way enter into it; + only those written in the Lamb’s scroll of life [will]. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “he will tent.” ^ “Tent.” Gr., ske·neʹ; Lat., ta·ber·naʹcu·lum; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), mish·kanʹ .
