And in the midst of the throne and around the throne [there are] four living creatures + that are full of eyes in front and behind. 7 And the first living creature is like a lion, + and the second living creature is like a young bull, + and the third living creature + has a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature + is like a flying eagle. + 8 And as for the four living creatures, + each one of them respectively has six wings; + round about and underneath * they are full of eyes. + And they have no rest day and night as they say: “Holy, holy, holy * is Jehovah * + God, the Almighty, * + who was and who is + and who is coming.” 9 And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving + to the one seated upon the throne, + the one that lives forever and ever, + 10 the twenty-four elders * + fall down before the One seated upon the throne and worship + the One that lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 “You are worthy, Jehovah, * even our God, to receive the glory + and the honor + and the power, + because you created all things, + and because of your will + they existed and were created.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Step up.” ^ Or, “a sardius [or, sardian stone].” ^ “Elders.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹrous . ^ Lit., “are.” ^ Or, “within.” ^ “Holy, holy, holy,” AVgSy h ; א * reads “holy” eight times.
