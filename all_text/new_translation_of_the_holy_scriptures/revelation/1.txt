He is coming with the clouds, + and every eye will see him, + and those who pierced him; + and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him. + Yes, Amen. 8 “I am the Alʹpha and the O·meʹga,” * + says Jehovah * God, “the One who is and who was and who is coming, + the Almighty.” * + 9 I John, YOUR brother and a sharer with YOU in the tribulation + and kingdom + and endurance + in company with Jesus, + came to be in the isle that is called Patʹmos for speaking about God and bearing witness * to Jesus. * + 10 By inspiration * + I came to be + in the Lord’s day, * + and I heard behind me a strong voice + like that of a trumpet, 11 saying: “What you see write + in a scroll and send it to the seven congregations, + in Ephʹe·sus + and in Smyrʹna + and in Perʹga·mum + and in Thy·a·tiʹra + and in Sarʹdis + and in Philadelphia + and in La·o·di·ceʹa.” + 12 And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me, and, having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, + 13 and in the midst of the lampstands someone like a son of man, + clothed with a garment that reached down to the feet, and girded at the breasts with a golden girdle. 14 Moreover, his head and his hair were white + as white wool, as snow, and his eyes as a fiery flame; + 15 and his feet were like fine copper + when glowing in a furnace; and his voice + was as the sound of many waters. 16 And he had in his right hand seven stars, + and out of his mouth a sharp, long two-edged sword + was protruding, and his countenance was as the sun when it shines in its power. + 17 And when I saw him, I fell as dead at his feet. And he laid his right hand upon me and said: “Do not be fearful. + I am the First * + and the Last, + 18 and the living one; + and I became dead, + but, look! I am living forever and ever, + and I have the keys of death + and of Haʹdes. * + 19 Therefore write down the things you saw, and the things that are and the things that will take place after these. + 20 As for the sacred secret of the seven stars + that you saw upon my right hand, and [of] the seven golden lampstands: + The seven stars mean * [the] angels of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands mean seven congregations. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “in quickness.” ^ Lit., “uncovering; disclosure.” Gr., A·po·kaʹly·psis; Lat., A·po·ca·lyʹpsis . ^ Lit., “The Being; The Existing One.” Gr., ho on .
