This is what we said to them: ‘Who put an order through to YOU to build this house and to finish this beam structure?’ + 10 And we also asked them their names, so as to let you know, that we might write the names of the able-bodied men that are at their head. + 11 “And this is the word that they gave back to us, saying: ‘We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth, + and we are rebuilding the house that had been built many years before this, which a great king of Israel built and finished. + 12 However, because our fathers irritated + the God of the heavens, he gave + them into the hand of Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar + the king of Babylon, the Chal·deʹan, + and he demolished this house + and took the people into exile at Babylon. + 13 Nevertheless, in the first year of Cyrus + the king of Babylon, * Cyrus the king put an order through to rebuild this house of God. + 14 And also the gold and silver vessels + of the house of God that Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar had taken out of the temple, which was in Jerusalem, and brought to the temple of Babylon, * + these Cyrus the king + took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were given to Shesh·bazʹzar, * + the name of the one whom he made governor. + 15 And he said to him: “Take these vessels. + Go, deposit them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt upon its place.” + 16 When that Shesh·bazʹzar came he laid the foundations of the house of God, + which is in Jerusalem; and from then until now it is being rebuilt but it has not been completed.’ + 17 “And now if to the king it seems good, let there be an investigation + in the king’s house of treasures that is there in Babylon, whether it is so that from Cyrus the king an order + was put through to rebuild that house of God in Jerusalem; and the decision of the king concerning this let him send to us.” Footnotes ^ “The son of Shealtiel.” Aram., bar- Sheʼal·ti·ʼelʹ .
