For we have left your commandments, + 11 which you commanded by means of your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that YOU people are going in to take possession of is an impure land because of the impurity of the peoples of the lands, + because of their detestable things + with which they have filled it from end + to end by their uncleanness. + 12 And now YOUR daughters do not YOU people give to their sons, + neither their daughters do YOU accept for YOUR sons; and to time indefinite YOU must not work for their peace + and their prosperity, * in order that YOU may grow strong + and certainly eat the good of the land and indeed take possession [of it] for YOUR sons to time indefinite.’ + 13 And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds + and our great guiltiness—for you yourself, O our God, have underestimated our error, + and you have given us those who have escaped such as these + — 14 shall we go breaking your commandments again and forming marriage alliances + with the peoples of these detestable things? + Will you not get incensed at us to the limit + so that there will be none remaining + and none escaping? 15 O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, + because we have been left over as an escaped people as at this day. Here we are before you in our guiltiness, + for it is impossible to stand before you on account of this.” + Footnotes ^ Likely, “a remnant,” one Heb. ms and by a slight correction of M (from ya·thedhʹ to yeʹther ). ^ Lit., “their good.” Previous Next Print Share Share
