And the people began to gather themselves as one + man to Jerusalem. + 2 And Jeshʹu·a * + the son of Je·hozʹa·dak * and his brothers the priests and Ze·rubʹba·bel + the son of She·alʹti·el + and his brothers proceeded to rise up and build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt sacrifices upon it, according to what is written + in the law of Moses the man of the [true] God. * 3 So they established the altar firmly upon its own site, + for fright [came] upon them * because of the peoples of the lands, * + and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah upon it, the burnt sacrifices of the morning and of the evening. + 4 Then they held the festival of booths + according to what is written, + with the burnt sacrifices day by day in number according to the rule of what was due each day. + 5 And afterward there was the constant burnt offering + and that for the new moons + and for all the sanctified festival + seasons of Jehovah and for everyone that willingly offered a voluntary + offering to Jehovah. 6 From the first day of the seventh month + on they started to offer up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah, when the foundation of Jehovah’s temple * itself had not yet been laid. 7 And they proceeded to give money + to the cutters + and to the craftsmen, + and eatables + and drink and oil + to the Si·doʹni·ans + and the Tyrʹi·ans, + to bring cedar timbers from Lebʹa·non + to the sea at Jopʹpa, + according to the permission granted by Cyrus + the king of Persia to them. 8 And in the second year of their coming to the house of the [true] God at Jerusalem, in the second month, + Ze·rubʹba·bel + the son of She·alʹti·el + and Jeshʹu·a + the son of Je·hozʹa·dak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity + to Jerusalem started; and they now put in positions the Levites + from twenty years of age upward to act as supervisors over the work of the house of Jehovah. + 9 Accordingly Jeshʹu·a, + his sons and his brothers, [and] Kadʹmi·el and his sons, the sons of Judah, * stood up as one group to act as supervisors over the doers of the work in the house of the [true] God, [also] the sons of Henʹa·dad, + their sons and their brothers, the Levites. 10 When the builders laid the foundation + of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, + with the trumpets, + and the Levites the sons of Aʹsaph, + with the cymbals, + stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction + of David the king of Israel. 11 And they began to respond by praising + and giving thanks to Jehovah, “for he is good, + for his loving-kindness * toward Israel is to time indefinite.” + As for all the people, they shouted with a loud shout + in praising Jehovah over the laying of the foundation of the house of Jehovah. 12 And many of the priests + and the Levites and the heads of the paternal + houses, the old men that had seen the former house, + were weeping + with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation + of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy. + 13 Hence the people were not distinguishing the sound of the shout of rejoicing + from the sound of the weeping of the people, for the people were shouting with a loud shout, and the sound itself was heard even to a great distance.
