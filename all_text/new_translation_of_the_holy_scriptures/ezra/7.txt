and he was a skilled copyist + in the law of Moses, + which Jehovah the God of Israel had given, so that the king granted him, according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him, all his request. + 7 Consequently some of the sons of Israel and of the priests + and the Levites + and the singers + and the gatekeepers + and the Nethʹi·nim + went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Ar·ta·xerxʹes + the king. 8 At length he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, that is, in the seventh year of the king. 9 For on the first [day] of the first month he himself appointed the going up from Babylon, and on the first [day] of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. + 10 For Ezʹra himself had prepared + his heart to consult the law of Jehovah + and to do [it] + and to teach + in Israel regulation + and justice. + 11 And this is a copy of the letter that King Ar·ta·xerxʹes gave Ezʹra the priest the copyist, + a copyist of the words of the commandments of Jehovah and of his regulations toward Israel: 12 * “Ar·ta·xerxʹes, + the king of kings, + to Ezʹra the priest, the copyist of the law of the God of the heavens: + [Peace] be perfected. + And now 13 by me an order + has been put through that everyone in my realm + of the people of Israel and their priests and Levites that is willing to go to Jerusalem with you should go. + 14 Inasmuch as from before the king and his seven counselors + [an order] was sent to investigate + concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the law + of your God + that is in your hand, 15 and to bring the silver and the gold that the king and his counselors have voluntarily given + to the God of Israel, whose residence is in Jerusalem, + 16 with all the silver and the gold that you find in all the jurisdictional district of Babylon along with the gift of the people + and the priests who are voluntarily giving to the house of their God, + which is in Jerusalem; 17 accordingly you will promptly buy with this money bulls, + rams, + lambs + and their grain offerings + and their drink offerings + and you will present them upon the altar of the house of YOUR God, + which is in Jerusalem. + 18 “And whatever it seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, + according to the will + of YOUR God, YOU men will do. + 19 And the vessels + that are being given to you for the service of the house of your God deliver in full before God at Jerusalem. + 20 And the rest of the necessities of the house of your God that it devolves upon you to give, you will give out of the king’s house of treasures. + 21 “And by me myself, Ar·ta·xerxʹes the king, an order + has been put through to all the treasurers + that are beyond the River, + that everything that Ezʹra + the priest, the copyist of the law of the God of the heavens, requests of YOU men it will be done promptly, 22 even to a hundred talents * + of silver and a hundred cor * + measures of wheat and a hundred bath * + measures of wine + and a hundred bath measures of oil, + and salt + without limit. 23 Let all that is by the order + of the God of the heavens be done with zeal + for the house of the God of the heavens, + that there may occur no wrath against the king’s realm and his sons. + 24 And to YOU men it is being made known that, as respects any of the priests + and the Levites, + the musicians, * + the doorkeepers, + the Nethʹi·nim, + and the workers of this house of God, no tax, tribute + or toll + is allowed to be imposed upon them. 25 “And you, Ezʹra, according to the wisdom + of your God that is in your hand appoint magistrates and judges that they may continually judge + all the people that are beyond the River, even all those knowing the laws of your God; and anyone that has not known [them] YOU men will instruct. + 26 And as for everyone that does not become a doer of the law of your God + and the law of the king, let judgment be promptly executed upon him, whether for death + or for banishment, + or for money fine + or for imprisonment.” * 27 Blessed be Jehovah the God of our forefathers, + who has put such a thing into the heart + of the king, to beautify + the house of Jehovah, which is in Jerusalem! 28 And toward me he has extended loving-kindness * + before the king and his counselors + and as respects all the mighty princes of the king. And I, for my part, strengthened myself according to the hand + of Jehovah my God upon me, and I proceeded to collect out of Israel the head ones to go up with me.
