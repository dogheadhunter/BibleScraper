I, Da·riʹus, do put through an order. Let it be done promptly.” 13 Then Tatʹte·nai the governor beyond the River, + Sheʹthar-bozʹe·nai + and their colleagues, just as Da·riʹus the king had sent [word], so they did promptly. 14 And the older men + of the Jews were building + and making progress under the prophesying of Hagʹgai + the prophet and Zech·a·riʹah + the grandson of Idʹdo, + and they built and finished [it] due to the order of the God of Israel + and due to the order of Cyrus + and Da·riʹus + and Ar·ta·xerxʹes + the king of Persia. 15 And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Aʹdar, + that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Da·riʹus the king. 16 And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites + and the rest of the former exiles * + held the inauguration + of this house of God with joy. 17 And they presented for the inauguration of this house of God a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. + 18 And they appointed the priests in their classes and the Levites in their divisions, + for the service of God which is in Jerusalem, according to the prescription of the book of Moses. * + 19 And the former exiles proceeded to hold the passover + on the fourteenth [day] of the first month. + 20 As the priests and the Levites had cleansed + themselves as one group, they were all of them clean, and so they slaughtered the passover victim + for all the former exiles and for their brothers the priests and for themselves. 21 Then the sons of Israel that had returned from the Exile ate, + and everyone that had separated himself to them from the uncleanness + of the nations of the land, to search for Jehovah the God of Israel. + 22 And they went on to hold the festival of unfermented cakes + seven days with rejoicing; for Jehovah caused them to rejoice, and he had turned + the heart of the king of As·syrʹi·a around toward them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of the [true] God, the God of Israel.
