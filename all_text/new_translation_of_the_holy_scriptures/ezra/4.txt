They are building the rebellious and bad city, and they proceed to finish the walls + and to repair the foundations. 13 Now let it become known to the king that, if this city should be rebuilt and its walls be finished, neither tax + nor tribute + nor toll + will they give, and it will cause loss to the treasuries + of the kings. 14 Now inasmuch as we do eat the salt * of the palace, and it is not proper for us to see the denuding of the king, on this account we have sent and made [it] known to the king, 15 that there may be an investigation of the book of records + of your ancestors. Then you will find in the book of records and learn that that city is a city rebellious and causing loss to kings and jurisdictional districts, and within it there were movers of revolt from the days of old. For this reason that city has been laid waste. + 16 We are making known to the king that, if that city should be rebuilt and its walls be finished, you also will certainly have no share beyond the River.” * + 17 The king sent word to Reʹhum + the chief government official and Shimʹshai the scribe and the rest of their colleagues + who were dwelling in Sa·marʹi·a and the rest beyond the River: “Greetings! * + And now 18 the official document that YOU have sent us * has been distinctly read before me. 19 So an order has been put through by me, and they have investigated + and found that that city has from the days of old been one rising up against kings and one in which rebellion and revolt have been carried on. + 20 And there proved to be strong kings + over Jerusalem and governing all beyond the River, + and tax, tribute and toll were being given to them. + 21 Now PUT an order through for these able-bodied men to stop, that that city may not be rebuilt until the order is put through by me. 22 So be careful that there be no negligence about acting in this regard, that the harm may not increase to the injury of kings.” + 23 Now after the copy of the official document of Ar·ta·xerxʹes the king had been read before Reʹhum + and Shimʹshai + the scribe and their colleagues, + they went in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms. * + 24 It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Da·riʹus + the king of Persia. Footnotes ^ Lit., “[There is] nothing to you and to us.” A Heb. idiom. See App 7B . ^ Ezra is written in Aram. from this vs through 6:18 . ^ Or, “the transriverine (transfluvial) lesser governors.” ^ Or, “Shushan.” ^ In M the verb is evidently omitted here. LXX inserts “judged,” transposing this verb to the beginning of vs 9. ^ Or, “Osnappar.” This is a clipped rendering of the name of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal; Aram., like the Persian, which has no l, substitutes an r for the final l . ^ “Eat the salt.” An ancient expression meaning to receive a salary in payment for service. ^ That is, the Euphrates. ^ Lit., “Peace!” Aram., shelamʹ . ^ “Us,” pl. to denote excellence, and it is used like the present-day editorial “we.” ^ Or, “by an army.” Lit., “with arm and strength.” Previous Next Print Share Share
