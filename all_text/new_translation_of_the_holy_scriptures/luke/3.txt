Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way of Jehovah, * YOU people, make his roads straight. + 5 Every gully must be filled up, and every mountain and hill leveled down, and the curves must become straight ways and the rough places smooth ways; + 6 and all flesh will see the saving means of God.’” + 7 Therefore he began to say to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him: “Y OU offspring of vipers, + who has intimated to YOU to flee from the coming wrath? + 8 Therefore produce fruits that befit repentance. * + And do not start saying within yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ For I say to YOU that God has power to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. 9 Indeed, the ax is already in position at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, not producing fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire.” + 10 And the crowds would ask him: “What, then, shall we do?” + 11 In reply he would say to them: “Let the man that has two undergarments share with the man that has none, and let him that has things to eat do the same.” + 12 But even tax collectors came to be baptized, and they said to him: “Teacher, what shall we do?” + 13 He said to them: “Do not demand anything more than the tax rate.” + 14 Also, those in military service would ask him: “What shall we also do?” And he said to them: “Do not harass anybody or accuse + anybody falsely, but be satisfied with YOUR provisions.” * + 15 Now as the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John: “May he perhaps be the Christ?” + 16 John gave the answer, saying to all: “I, for my part, baptize YOU with water; but the one stronger than I am is coming, the lace of whose sandals I am not fit to untie. + He will baptize YOU people with holy spirit and fire. + 17 His winnowing shovel is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor completely and to gather + the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff + he will burn up with fire + that cannot be put out.” 18 Therefore he also gave many other exhortations and continued declaring good news to the people. 19 But Herod the district ruler, * for being reproved by him concerning He·roʹdi·as the wife of his brother and concerning all the wicked deeds that Herod did, + 20 added also this to all those [deeds]: he locked John up in prison. + 21 Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus + also was baptized * and, as he was praying, the heaven + was opened up 22 and the holy spirit in bodily shape like a dove came down upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.” + 23 Furthermore, Jesus himself, when he commenced [his work], * + was about thirty + years old, being the son, + as the opinion was, * of Joseph, + [son] of Heʹli, 24 [son] of Matʹthat, [son] of Leʹvi, [son] of Melʹchi, [son] of Janʹna·i, [son] of Joseph, 25 [son] of Mat·ta·thiʹas, [son] of Aʹmos, [son] of Naʹhum, [son] of Esʹli, [son] of Nagʹga·i, 26 [son] of Maʹath, [son] of Mat·ta·thiʹas, [son] of Semʹe·in, [son] of Joʹsech, [son] of Joʹda, 27 [son] of Jo·anʹan, [son] of Rheʹsa, [son] of Ze·rubʹba·bel, + [son] of She·alʹti·el, * + [son] of Neʹri, 28 [son] of Melʹchi, [son] of Adʹdi, [son] of Coʹsam, [son] of El·maʹdam, [son] of Er, 29 [son] of Jesus, * [son] of E·li·eʹzer, [son] of Joʹrim, [son] of Matʹthat, [son] of Leʹvi, 30 [son] of Symʹe·on, [son] of Judas, [son] of Joseph, [son] of Joʹnam, [son] of E·liʹa·kim, 31 [son] of Meʹle·a, [son] of Menʹna, [son] of Matʹta·tha, [son] of Nathan, + [son] of David, + 32 [son] of Jesʹse, + [son] of Oʹbed, * + [son] of Boʹaz, + [son] of Salʹmon, * + [son] of Nahʹshon, + 33 [son] of Am·minʹa·dab, * + [son] of Arʹni, * + [son] of Hezʹron, + [son] of Peʹrez, + [son] of Judah, + 34 [son] of Jacob, + [son] of Isaac, + [son] of Abraham, + [son] of Teʹrah, + [son] of Naʹhor, + 35 [son] of Seʹrug, + [son] of Reʹu, + [son] of Peʹleg, + [son] of Eʹber, + [son] of Sheʹlah, + 36 [son] of Ca·iʹnan, * [son] of Ar·pachʹshad, + [son] of Shem, + [son] of Noah, + [son] of Laʹmech, + 37 [son] of Me·thuʹse·lah, + [son] of Eʹnoch, + [son] of Jaʹred, + [son] of Ma·haʹla·le·el, + [son] of Ca·iʹnan, + 38 [son] of Eʹnosh, + [son] of Seth, + [son] of Adam, + [son] of God.
