For the kingdom of God belongs to suchlike ones. + 17 Truly I say to YOU , Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a young child will by no means get into it.” + 18 And a certain ruler questioned him, saying: “Good Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?” + 19 Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God. + 20 You know the commandments, + ‘Do not commit adultery, + Do not murder, + Do not steal, + Do not bear false witness, + Honor your father and mother.’” + 21 Then he said: “All these I have kept from youth on.” + 22 After hearing that, Jesus said to him: “There is yet one thing lacking about you: Sell all the things you have and distribute to poor people, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come be my follower.” + 23 When he heard this, he became deeply grieved, for he was very rich. + 24 Jesus looked at him and said: “How difficult a thing it will be for those having money to make their way into the kingdom of God! + 25 It is easier, in fact, for a camel to get through the eye of a sewing needle than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” + 26 Those who heard this said: “Who possibly can be saved?” 27 He said: “The things impossible with men are possible with God.” + 28 But Peter said: “Look! We have left our own things and followed you.” + 29 He said to them: “Truly I say to YOU , There is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God + 30 who will not in any way get many times more in this period of time, and in the coming system of things * everlasting life.” + 31 Then he took the twelve aside and said to them: “Look! We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things written by means of the prophets + as to the Son of man will be completed. + 32 For instance, he will be delivered up to [men of] the nations and will be made fun + of and be treated insolently + and spit + upon; 33 and after scourging + him they will kill + him, but on the third day he will rise.” + 34 However, they did not get the meaning of any of these things; but this utterance was hidden from them, and they were not knowing the things said. + 35 Now as he was getting near to Jerʹi·cho a certain blind man was sitting beside the road begging. + 36 Because he heard a crowd moving through he began to inquire what this might mean. 37 They reported to him: “Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ is passing by!” + 38 At that he cried out, saying: “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” + 39 And those going in advance began to tell him sternly to keep quiet, but that much more he kept shouting: “Son of David, have mercy on me.” + 40 Then Jesus stood still and commanded the [man] to be led to him. + After he got near, [Jesus] * asked him: 41 “What do you want me to do for you?” + He said: “Lord, * let me recover sight.” + 42 So Jesus said to him: “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” * + 43 And instantly he recovered sight, + and he began to follow him, glorifying God. + Also, all the people, at seeing [it], gave praise to God.
