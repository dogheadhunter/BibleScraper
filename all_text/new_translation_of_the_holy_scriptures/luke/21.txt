+ For there will be great necessity upon the land * and wrath on this people; 24 and they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the nations; + and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, * until the appointed times + of the nations are fulfilled. * 25 “Also, there will be signs in sun + and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea + and [its] agitation, + 26 while men become faint out of fear + and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth; * + for the powers * of the heavens will be shaken. + 27 And then they will see the Son of man + coming * in a cloud with power and great glory. + 28 But as these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift YOUR heads up, because YOUR deliverance is getting near.” 29 With that he spoke an illustration to them: “Note the fig tree and all the other trees: + 30 When they are already in the bud, by observing it YOU know for yourselves that now the summer is near. + 31 In this way YOU also, when YOU see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near. + 32 Truly I say to YOU , This generation * will by no means pass away until all things occur. + 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, + but my words will by no means pass away. + 34 “But pay attention to yourselves that YOUR hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy + drinking and anxieties + of life, * and suddenly that day be instantly upon YOU + 35 as a snare. + For it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth. + 36 Keep awake, + then, all the time making supplication + that YOU may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.” + 37 So by day he would be teaching in the temple, + but by night he would go out and lodge on the mountain called the Mount of Olives. + 38 And all the people + would come early in the day to him in the temple to hear him.
