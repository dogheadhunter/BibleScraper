That one also they beat up and dishonored and sent away empty. + 12 Yet again he sent a third; + this one also they wounded and threw out. 13 At this the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son the beloved. + Likely they will respect this one.’ 14 When the cultivators caught sight of him they went reasoning with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.’ + 15 With that they threw him outside + the vineyard and killed + him. What, therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do to them? + 16 He will come and destroy these cultivators and will give the vineyard to others.” + On hearing [this] they said: “Never may that happen!” 17 But he looked upon them and said: “What, then, does this that is written mean, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, + this has become the chief cornerstone’? + 18 Everyone falling upon that stone will be shattered. + As for anyone upon whom it falls, + it will pulverize him.” + 19 The scribes and the chief priests now sought to get their hands on him in that very hour, but they feared the people; for they perceived that he spoke this illustration with them in mind. + 20 And, after observing him closely, they sent out men secretly hired to pretend that they were righteous, in order that they might catch + him in speech, so as to turn him over to the government and to the authority of the governor. + 21 And they questioned him, saying: “Teacher, we know you speak and teach correctly and show no partiality, but you teach the way of God in line with truth: + 22 Is it lawful for us to pay tax to Caesar * or not?” + 23 But he detected their cunning and said to them: + 24 “Show me a de·narʹi·us. * Whose image and inscription does it have?” They said: “Caesar’s.” + 25 He said to them: “By all means, then, pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, + but God’s things to God.” + 26 Well, they were not able to catch him in this saying before the people, but, in amazement at his answer, they said nothing. + 27 However, some of the Sadducees, those who say there is no resurrection, came up + and questioned him, 28 saying: “Teacher, Moses + wrote us, ‘If a man’s brother dies having a wife, but this one remained childless, his brother + should take the wife and raise up offspring from her for his brother.’ + 29 Accordingly there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife and died childless. + 30 So the second, 31 and the third took her. Likewise even the seven: they did not leave children behind, but died off. + 32 Lastly, the woman also died. + 33 Consequently, in the resurrection, * of which one of them does she become [the] wife? For the seven got her as wife.” + 34 Jesus said to them: “The children of this system of things * marry + and are given in marriage, 35 but those who have been counted worthy + of gaining that system of things + and the resurrection from the dead + neither marry nor are given in marriage. 36 In fact, neither can they die + anymore, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children * by being children of the resurrection. + 37 But that the dead are raised up even Moses disclosed, in the account about the thornbush, + when he calls Jehovah * ‘the God of Abraham * and God of Isaac and God of Jacob.’ + 38 He is a God, not of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him.” * + 39 In response some of the scribes said: “Teacher, you spoke well.” 40 For no longer did they have the courage to ask him a single question. 41 In turn he said to them: “How is it they say that the Christ is David’s son? + 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘Jehovah * said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand 43 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ + 44 David, therefore, calls him ‘Lord’; so how is he his son?” 45 Then, while all the people were listening he said to the disciples: + 46 “Look out for the scribes who desire to walk around in robes and like greetings in the marketplaces * and front seats in the synagogues and most prominent places at evening meals, + 47 and who devour the houses of the widows + and for a pretext make long prayers. These will receive a heavier judgment.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “immersion; dipping.” Gr., baʹpti·sma . ^ Or, “to the emperor.” Gr., Kaiʹsa·ri; Lat., Caeʹsa·ri . ^ A Roman silver coin that weighed 3.85 g (0.124 oz t). ^ “Resurrection.” Gr., a·na·staʹsei, “raising up; standing up” (from a·naʹ, “up,” and staʹsis, “standing”); Lat., re·sur·rec·ti·oʹne . ^ Or, “order of things.” Gr., ai·oʹnos; Lat., saeʹcu·li; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha· ʽoh·lamʹ , “the order of things .” ^ “Children.” Or, “sons.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “when he says: ‘Jehovah the God of Abraham.’ ” ^ Or, “living from his standpoint.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See 11:43 ftn.
