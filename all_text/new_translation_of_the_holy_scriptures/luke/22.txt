When YOU enter into the city a man carrying an earthenware vessel of water will meet YOU . Follow him into the house into which he enters. + 11 And YOU must say to the landlord of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you: “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?”’ + 12 And that [man] will show YOU a large upper room furnished. Get [it] ready there.” + 13 So they departed and found it just as he had said to them, and they got the passover ready. + 14 At length when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him. + 15 And he said to them: “I have greatly desired to eat this passover with YOU before I suffer; 16 for I tell YOU , I will not eat it again until it becomes fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” + 17 And, accepting a cup, + he gave thanks and said: “Take this and pass it from one to the other among yourselves; 18 for I tell YOU , From now on I will not drink again from the product of the vine until the kingdom of God arrives.” + 19 Also, he took a loaf, + gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying: “This means * my body + which is to be given in YOUR behalf. + Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” + 20 Also, the cup + in the same way after they had the evening meal, he saying: “This cup means the new covenant + by virtue of my blood, + which is to be poured out in YOUR behalf. * + 21 “But, look! the hand of my betrayer + is with me at the table. + 22 Because the Son of man is going his way according to what is marked out; + all the same, woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!” + 23 So they started to discuss among themselves the question of which of them would really be the one that was about to do this. + 24 However, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them seemed to be greatest. + 25 But he said to them: “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those having authority over them are called Benefactors. + 26 Y OU , though, are not to be that way. + But let him that is the greatest among YOU become as the youngest, + and the one acting as chief as the one ministering. * + 27 For which one is greater, the one reclining at the table or the one ministering? Is it not the one reclining at the table? But I am in YOUR midst as the one ministering. + 28 “However, YOU are the ones that have stuck + with me in my trials; + 29 and I make a covenant with YOU , just as my Father has made a covenant + with me, for a kingdom, + 30 that YOU may eat + and drink at my table in my kingdom, + and sit on thrones + to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. 31 “Simon, Simon, look! Satan + has demanded to have YOU men to sift YOU as wheat. + 32 But I have made supplication + for you that your faith may not give out; and you, when once you have returned, strengthen + your brothers.” 33 Then he said to him: “Lord, * I am ready to go with you both into prison and into death.” + 34 But he said: “I tell you, Peter, A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me.” + 35 He also said to them: “When I sent + YOU forth without purse and food pouch and sandals, YOU did not want for anything, did YOU ?” They said: “No!” * 36 Then he said to them: “But now let the one that has a purse take it up, likewise also a food pouch; and let the one having no sword sell his outer garment and buy one. 37 For I tell YOU that this which is written must be accomplished in me, namely, ‘And he was reckoned with lawless ones.’ + For that which concerns me is having an accomplishment.” + 38 Then they said: “Lord, * look! here are two swords.” He said to them: “It is enough.” 39 On going out he went as customarily to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him. + 40 Having come to the place he said to them: “Carry on prayer, that YOU do not enter into temptation.” + 41 And he himself drew away from them about a stone’s throw, and bent his knees and began to pray, 42 saying: “Father, if you wish, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, let, not my will, + but yours take place.” + 43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. + 44 But getting into an agony he continued praying more earnestly; + and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground. * + 45 And he rose from prayer, went to the disciples and found them slumbering from grief; + 46 and he said to them: “Why are YOU sleeping? Rise and carry on prayer, that YOU do not enter into temptation.” + 47 While he was yet speaking, look! a crowd, and the [man] called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them; + and he approached Jesus to kiss him. + 48 But Jesus said to him: “Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?” + 49 When those about him saw what was going to happen, they said: “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” + 50 A certain one of them even did strike the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear. + 51 But in reply Jesus said: “L ET it go as far as this.” And he touched the ear and healed him. + 52 Jesus then said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and older men that had come there for him: “Did YOU come out with swords and clubs as against a robber? + 53 While I was with YOU in the temple + day after day YOU did not stretch out YOUR hands against me. + But this is YOUR hour + and the authority + of darkness.” + 54 Then they arrested him and led + him off and brought him into the house of the high priest; + but Peter was following at a distance. + 55 When they lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting in among them. + 56 But a certain servant girl saw him sitting by the bright fire and looked him over and said: “This man also was with him.” + 57 But he denied + it, * saying: “I do not know him, woman.” + 58 And after a short time another person seeing him said: “You also are one of them.” But Peter said: “Man, I am not.” + 59 And after about an hour intervened a certain other [man] began insisting strongly: “For a certainty this [man] also was with him; for, in fact, he is a Gal·i·leʹan!” + 60 But Peter said: “Man, I do not know what you are saying.” And instantly, while he was yet speaking, a cock crowed. + 61 And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter, and Peter recalled the utterance of the Lord when he said to him: “Before a cock crows today you will disown me three times.” + 62 And he went outside and wept bitterly. + 63 Now the men that had him * in custody began to make fun + of him, hitting + him; + 64 and after covering him over they would ask and say: “Prophesy. Who is it that struck you?” + 65 And they went on saying many other things in blasphemy + against him. 66 At length when it became day, the assembly of older men of the people, both chief priests and scribes, gathered together, + and they haled him into their Sanʹhe·drin hall, * saying: + 67 “If you are the Christ, + tell us.” But he said to them: “Even if I told YOU , YOU would not believe it at all. + 68 Moreover, if I questioned YOU , YOU would not answer at all. + 69 However, from now on the Son of man + will be sitting at the powerful right + hand * of God.” + 70 At this they all said: “Are you, therefore, the Son of God?” He said to them: “Y OU yourselves are saying + that I am.” 71 They said: “Why do we need further witness? + For we ourselves have heard [it] out of his own mouth.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “is,” in the sense of signifying, importing, representing.
