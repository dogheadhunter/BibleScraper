Make me as one of your hired men.”’ 20 So he rose and went to his father. While he was yet a long way off, his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity, and he ran and fell upon his neck and tenderly kissed him. 21 Then the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. * + I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Make me as one of your hired men.’ * + 22 But the father said to his slaves, ‘Quick! bring out a robe, the best one, and clothe + him with it, and put a ring + on his hand and sandals on his feet. 23 And bring the fattened + young bull, slaughter * it and let us eat and enjoy ourselves, 24 because this my son was dead and came to life + again; he was lost and was found.’ And they started to enjoy themselves. 25 “Now his older son + was in the field; and as he came and got near the house he heard a music concert and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants to him and inquired what these things meant. 27 He said to him, ‘Your brother + has come, and your father + slaughtered the fattened young bull, because he got him back in good health.’ 28 But he became wrathful and was unwilling to go in. Then his father came out and began to entreat him. + 29 In reply he said to his father, ‘Here it is so many years I have slaved for you and never once did I transgress your commandment, and yet to me you never once gave a kid for me to enjoy myself with my friends. + 30 But as soon as this your son + who ate up your means of living with harlots + arrived, you slaughtered the fattened young bull for him.’ + 31 Then he said to him, ‘Child, you have always been with me, and all the things that are mine are yours; + 32 but we just had to enjoy ourselves and rejoice, because this your brother was dead and came to life, and he was lost and was found.’” + Footnotes ^ A drachma was a Gr. silver coin that weighed 3.40 g (0.109 oz t). ^ Or, “in your sight”; as in 1Sa 20:1 in LXX. ^ “Make me as one of your hired men,” א BDSy h ; P 75 AWVgSy p,s omit. ^ See vs 18 ftn. ^ Or, “sacrifice.” Previous Next Print Share Share
