In his days the land had no disturbance + for ten years. * 2 And Aʹsa proceeded to do what was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God. 3 So he removed the foreign altars * + and the high places + and broke up the sacred pillars + and cut down the sacred poles. * + 4 Further, he said to Judah to search + for Jehovah the God of their forefathers and to do the law + and the commandment. + 5 Accordingly he removed from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense stands; + and the kingdom continued without disturbance + before him. 6 And he went on to build fortified cities in Judah, + for the land had no disturbance; and there was no war against him during these years, for Jehovah gave him rest. + 7 So he said to Judah: “Let us build these cities and make walls + around and towers, + double doors and bars. + For us the land is yet available, because we have searched for Jehovah our God. + We have searched, and he gives us rest all around.” + And they went building and proving successful. + 8 And Aʹsa came to have a military force bearing the large shield + and lance, + three hundred thousand out of Judah. + And out of Benjamin those bearing the buckler and bending the bow + were two hundred and eighty thousand. + All these were valiant, mighty men. 9 Later Zeʹrah the E·thi·oʹpi·an * + went out against them with a military force of a million * men + and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Ma·reʹshah. + 10 Then Aʹsa went out against him * and they drew up in battle formation in the valley of Zephʹa·thah at Ma·reʹshah. 11 And Aʹsa began to call to Jehovah his God + and say: “O Jehovah, as to helping, it does not matter with you whether there are many or [those with] no power. + Help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon you we do lean, + and in your name + we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. + Do not let mortal man * retain strength against you.” + 12 At that Jehovah defeated + the E·thi·oʹpi·ans before Aʹsa and before Judah, and the E·thi·oʹpi·ans took to flight. 13 And Aʹsa and the people that were with him kept pursuing them as far as Geʹrar, + and those of the E·thi·oʹpi·ans continued falling down till there was no one alive of them; for they were broken to pieces before Jehovah + and before his camp. + Afterward they carried off a very great deal of spoil. + 14 Further, they struck all the cities round about Geʹrar, for the dread + of Jehovah had come to be upon them; and they went plundering all the cities, for there happened to be much to plunder in them. + 15 And even the tents + with livestock they struck so that they took captive + flocks in great number and camels, + after which they returned to Jerusalem.
