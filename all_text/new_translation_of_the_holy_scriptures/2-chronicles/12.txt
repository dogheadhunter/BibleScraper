I shall not bring them to ruin, and in a little while I shall certainly give them an escape, and my rage + will not pour forth upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shiʹshak. + 8 But they will become servants of his, + that they may know the difference between my service + and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.” + 9 So Shiʹshak + the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures of the house of Jehovah + and the treasures of the king’s house. + Everything he took; and so he took the gold shields that Solʹo·mon had made. + 10 Consequently King Re·ho·boʹam made in their place copper shields, and he committed them to the control of the chiefs of the runners, + the guards + of the entrance of the king’s house. + 11 And it would occur that as often as the king came to the house of Jehovah, the runners came in and carried them and returned them to the guard chamber of the runners. + 12 And because he humbled himself, Jehovah’s anger turned back from him, + and he [did] not [think] of bringing them to ruin completely. + And, besides, there happened to be good things in Judah. + 13 And King Re·ho·boʹam continued to make his position strong in Jerusalem and kept reigning; for Re·ho·boʹam + was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and for seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city + that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. + And his mother’s name was Naʹa·mah + the Amʹmon·it·ess. + 14 But he did what was bad, + for he had not firmly established his heart to search for Jehovah. + 15 As for Re·ho·boʹam’s affairs, the first and the last, + are they not written among the words of She·maiʹah + the prophet and of Idʹdo + the visionary by genealogical enrollment? And there were wars between Re·ho·boʹam + and Jer·o·boʹam + all the time. 16 Finally Re·ho·boʹam lay down with his forefathers + and was buried in the City of David; + and A·biʹjah * + his son began to reign in place of him.
