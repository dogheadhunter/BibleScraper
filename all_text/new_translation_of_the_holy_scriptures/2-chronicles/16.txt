Here I do send you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baʹa·sha + the king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.” + 4 So Ben-haʹdad listened to King Aʹsa and sent the chiefs of the military forces that were his against the cities of Israel, so that they struck Iʹjon + and Dan + and Aʹbel-maʹim + and all the storage places + of the cities of Naphʹta·li. + 5 And it came about that as soon as Baʹa·sha heard of it, he immediately quit building Raʹmah and stopped his work. + 6 As for Aʹsa the king, he took all Judah, + and they proceeded to carry away the stones of Raʹmah + and its timbers with which Baʹa·sha had built, + and he began to build with them Geʹba + and Mizʹpah. + 7 And at that time Ha·naʹni + the seer came to Aʹsa the king of Judah and then said to him: “Because you leaned upon the king of Syria + and did not lean upon Jehovah your God, + for that reason the military force of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand. 8 Did not the E·thi·oʹpi·ans + and the Libʹy·ans + themselves happen to be a very great military force in multitude, in chariots and in horsemen; + and because of your leaning upon Jehovah did he not give them into your hand? + 9 For, as regards Jehovah, his eyes + are roving about through all the earth + to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart + is complete toward him. You have acted foolishly + respecting this, for from now on there will exist wars against you.” + 10 However, Aʹsa became offended at the seer and put him in the house of the stocks, + because he was in a rage at him over this. + And Aʹsa began to crush + some others of the people at that same time. 11 And, look! the affairs of Aʹsa, the first and the last, there they are written in the Book + of the Kings of Judah and of Israel. 12 And Aʹsa in the thirty-ninth year of his reign developed an ailment in his feet until he was very sick; + and even in his sickness he searched not for Jehovah + but for the healers. + 13 Finally Aʹsa lay down with his forefathers + and died in the forty-first year of his reigning. 14 So they buried him in his grand burial place * + that he had excavated for himself in the City of David; + and they laid him in the bed that had been filled with balsam oil + and different sorts of ointment + mixed in an ointment of special make. + Further, they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning + for him. * Footnotes ^ “In his grand burial place .” Lit., “in his burial places .” Heb., ve qiv·ro·th avʹ, pl. to denote excellence; LXX, “tomb”; Vg, “sepulcher.” ^ Not a cremation of Asa but a burning of spices.
