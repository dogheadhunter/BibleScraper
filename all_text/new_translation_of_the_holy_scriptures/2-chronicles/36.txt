He did not humble + himself on account of Jeremiah + the prophet + at the order of Jehovah. 13 And even against King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar he rebelled, + who had made him swear by God; + and he kept stiffening + his neck and hardening + his heart so as not to return to Jehovah the God of Israel. 14 Even all the chiefs of the priests + and the people themselves committed unfaithfulness on a large scale, according to all the detestable + things of the nations, so that they defiled the house of Jehovah which he had sanctified in Jerusalem. + 15 And Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept sending against them by means of his messengers, + sending again and again, * because he felt compassion for his people + and for his dwelling. + 16 But they were continually making jest + at the messengers of the [true] God and despising his words + and mocking + at his prophets, until the rage + of Jehovah came up against his people, until there was no healing. + 17 So he brought up against them the king of the Chal·deʹans, + who proceeded to kill their young men with the sword + in the house of their sanctuary, + neither did he feel compassion for young man or virgin, old or decrepit. + Everything He gave into his hand. 18 And all the utensils, + great + and small, of the house of the [true] God and the treasures + of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king + and of his princes, everything he brought to Babylon. 19 And he proceeded to burn the house of the [true] God + and pull down the wall + of Jerusalem; and all its dwelling towers they burned with fire and also all its desirable articles, + so as to cause ruin. + 20 Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, + and they came to be servants to him + and his sons until the royalty of Persia + began to reign; 21 to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, + until the land had paid off its sabbaths. + All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years. + 22 And in the first year of Cyrus * + the king of Persia, + that Jehovah’s word + by the mouth of Jeremiah + might be accomplished, Jehovah roused the spirit + of Cyrus + the king of Persia, so that he caused a cry to pass through all his kingdom, and also in writing, + saying: 23 “This is what Cyrus the king of Persia + has said, ‘All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens * has given me, + and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. + Whoever there is among YOU of all his people, + Jehovah his God be with him. + So let him go up.’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Joahaz.” Heb., Yoh·ʼa·chazʹ .
