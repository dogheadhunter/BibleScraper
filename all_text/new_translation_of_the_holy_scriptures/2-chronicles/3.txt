See Eze 40:5 ftn, “Handbreadth.” ^ “A hundred and twenty,” MLXX B ; LXX A Sy, “twenty cubits.” By a transposition of the letters of the Heb. word for “a hundred” it would read “cubits,” to produce the expression “twenty cubits.” ^ Or, “studded the house with precious stones.” ^ “Gold country.” Heb., par·waʹyim; LXX Bagster (Gr.), pha·rou·imʹ . ^ See App 8A . ^ “Length,” MSy; LXX, “height.” ^ “In necklace style,” by a slight correction; M, “in the innermost room.” ^ Meaning “He Will Firmly Establish.” ^ Possibly meaning “In Strength.” Previous Next Print Share Share
