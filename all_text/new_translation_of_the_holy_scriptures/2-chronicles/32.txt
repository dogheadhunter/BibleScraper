How much less, then, will YOUR own God deliver * YOU out of my hand?’” + 16 And his servants spoke yet further against Jehovah the [true] God + and against Hez·e·kiʹah his servant. 17 Even letters he wrote + to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel + and to talk against him, saying: “Like the gods + of the nations of the lands who did not deliver their people out of my hand, + so the God of Hez·e·kiʹah will not deliver his people out of my hand.” 18 And they + kept calling with a loud voice + in the Jews’ + language to the people of Jerusalem that were upon the wall, to make them afraid + and to disturb them, in order that they might capture the city. 19 And they went on speaking against + the God of Jerusalem + the same way as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of man’s hands. + 20 But Hez·e·kiʹah + the king and Isaiah * + the son of Aʹmoz, + the prophet, + kept praying over this + and crying to the heavens for aid. + 21 And Jehovah proceeded to send an angel + and efface every valiant, mighty man + and leader and chief in the camp of the king of As·syrʹi·a, + so that he went back with shame of face to his own land. Later on he entered the house of his god * and there certain ones that had come out of his own inward parts felled him with the sword. + 22 Thus Jehovah saved Hez·e·kiʹah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem out of the hand of Sen·nachʹer·ib the king of As·syrʹi·a + and out of the hand of all others and gave them rest all around. + 23 And there were many bringing gifts + to Jehovah at Jerusalem and choice things to Hez·e·kiʹah the king of Judah, + and he came to be exalted + in the eyes of all the nations after that. 24 In those days Hez·e·kiʹah fell sick to the point of dying, + and he began to pray + to Jehovah. So He talked to him, + and a portent + He gave him. 25 But according to the benefit rendered him Hez·e·kiʹah made no return, + for his heart became haughty + and there came to be indignation + against him and against Judah and Jerusalem. 26 However, Hez·e·kiʹah humbled + himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and Jehovah’s indignation did not come upon them in the days + of Hez·e·kiʹah. 27 And Hez·e·kiʹah came to have riches and glory to a very great amount; + and storehouses he made for himself for silver and for gold + and for precious stones + and for balsam oil + and for shields + and for all the desirable articles; + 28 and also storage + places for the produce of grain and new wine + and oil, and also stalls + for all the different sorts of beasts and stalls for the droves. 29 And cities he acquired for himself, and also livestock of the flock + and of the herd + in abundance; for God gave him very many goods. + 30 And Hez·e·kiʹah was the one that stopped up + the upper source of the waters + of Giʹhon + and kept them directed straight along down to the west to the City of David, + and Hez·e·kiʹah continued to prove successful in every work of his. + 31 And thus it was that by the spokesmen of the princes of Babylon * + that were sent to him + to inquire about the portent + that had happened in the land, the [true] God left him + to put him to the test, + to get to know everything in his heart. + 32 As for the rest of the affairs + of Hez·e·kiʹah and his acts of loving-kindness, * + there they are written in the vision of Isaiah * the prophet, the son of Aʹmoz, + in the Book + of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 33 Finally Hez·e·kiʹah lay down with his forefathers, + and they buried him in the ascent to the burial places of the sons of David; + and honor was what all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem rendered to him at his death. + And Ma·nasʹseh + his son began to reign in place of him.
