Here is what Jehovah has said to YOU , ‘Do not YOU be afraid + or be terrified because of this large crowd; for the battle is not YOURS , but God’s. + 16 Tomorrow go down against them. There they are coming up by the pass of Ziz; and YOU will be certain to find them at the end of the torrent valley in front of the wilderness of Je·ruʹel. 17 Y OU will not need to fight + in this instance. Take YOUR position, stand still + and see the salvation + of Jehovah in YOUR behalf. O Judah and Jerusalem, do not be afraid or be terrified. + Tomorrow go out against * them, and Jehovah will be with YOU .’” + 18 At once Je·hoshʹa·phat bowed low with his face to the earth, + and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem themselves fell down before Jehovah to do obeisance to Jehovah. + 19 Then the Levites + of the sons of the Koʹhath·ites + and of the sons of the Koʹrah·ites + rose up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with an extraordinarily loud voice. + 20 And they proceeded to rise early in the morning and go out to the wilderness + of Te·koʹa. + And as they went out, Je·hoshʹa·phat stood up and then said: “Hear me, O Judah and YOU inhabitants of Jerusalem! + Put faith + in Jehovah YOUR God that YOU may prove yourselves of long duration. Put faith in his prophets + and so prove successful.” 21 Further, he took counsel + with the people and stationed singers + to Jehovah and those offering praise + in holy adornment + as they went out ahead of the armed men, + and saying: “G IVE praise to Jehovah, + for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness.” * + 22 And at the time that they started off with the joyful cry and praise, Jehovah set men in ambush + against the sons of Amʹmon, Moʹab and the mountainous region of Seʹir who were coming into Judah, and they went smiting one another. + 23 And the sons of Amʹmon and Moʹab proceeded to stand up against the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seʹir + to devote them to destruction and annihilate them; and as soon as they finished with the inhabitants of Seʹir, they helped each one to bring his own fellow to ruin. + 24 But as for Judah, it came to the watchtower of the wilderness. + When they turned their faces toward the crowd, why, there they were, their carcasses fallen to the earth + without anyone escaping. 25 So Je·hoshʹa·phat and his people came to plunder the spoil + on them, and they got to find among them in abundance both goods and clothing * and desirable articles; and they went stripping them off for themselves until they could carry no more. + And it came to be three days that they were plundering the spoil, for it was abundant. 26 And on the fourth day they congregated together at the low plain of Berʹa·cah, for there they blessed Jehovah. + That is why they called the name + of that place Low Plain of Berʹa·cah * —until today. 27 Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with Je·hoshʹa·phat at their head, to return to Jerusalem with rejoicing, for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies. + 28 So they came to Jerusalem with stringed instruments + and with harps + and with trumpets + to the house of Jehovah. + 29 And the dread + of God came to be upon all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel. + 30 Thus the royal realm of Je·hoshʹa·phat had no disturbance, and his God continued to give him rest all around. + 31 And Je·hoshʹa·phat + went on reigning over Judah. Thirty-five years old he was when he began to reign, and for twenty-five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was A·zuʹbah + the daughter of Shilʹhi. 32 And he kept walking in the way of his father Aʹsa, + and he did not turn aside from it, by doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes. + 33 Only the high places + themselves did not disappear; and the people themselves had not yet prepared their heart for the God of their forefathers. + 34 As for the rest of the affairs of Je·hoshʹa·phat, the first and the last, there they are written among the words of Jeʹhu + the son of Ha·naʹni, + which were inserted in the Book + of the Kings of Israel. 35 And after this Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah had partnership with A·ha·ziʹah + the king of Israel, who acted wickedly. + 36 So he made him a partner with himself in making ships to go to Tarʹshish + and they made ships in Eʹzi·on-geʹber. + 37 However, E·li·eʹzer the son of Dod·avʹa·hu of Ma·reʹsha spoke prophetically against Je·hoshʹa·phat, saying: “Inasmuch as you have had partnership with A·ha·ziʹah, + Jehovah will certainly break down your works.” + Accordingly the ships were wrecked, + and they did not retain strength to go to Tarʹshish. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “from the Ammonim.” Heb., me·ha·ʽAm·moh·nimʹ; by a transposition of letters in M, “the Meunim; Meunites”; LXX, “the Minaians”; Vg c , “the Ammonites.” ^ That is, the Red Sea. ^ “From Edom,” one Heb. ms; Heb., me· ʼAramʹ , “from Syria ”; Gr., Sy·riʹas ; Lat., Syʹri·a ; Sy, “the Red Sea.” ^ “In the congregation of.” Heb., bi q·halʹ ; Gr., ek·kle·siʹai . ^ Or, “friend.” Lat., a·miʹci . ^ Or, “before.” See Ge 10:9 ftn, “Opposition to.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Clothing,” Vg and seven Heb. mss; M, “carcasses.” ^ Meaning “Blessing.” Previous Next Print Share Share
