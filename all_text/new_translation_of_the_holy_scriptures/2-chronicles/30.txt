Give place * to Jehovah + and come to his sanctuary + that he has sanctified + to time indefinite and serve + Jehovah YOUR God, that his burning anger + may turn back from YOU . 9 For when YOU return + to Jehovah, YOUR brothers and YOUR sons will be objects of mercy + before those holding them captive, and be allowed to return to this land; + for Jehovah YOUR God is gracious + and merciful, + and he will not turn away the face from YOU if YOU return to him.” + 10 So the runners + continued on, passing along from city to city throughout the land of Eʹphra·im + and Ma·nasʹseh, even to Zebʹu·lun; but they were continually speaking in mockery of them and deriding them. + 11 Only individuals + from Ashʹer and Ma·nasʹseh and from Zebʹu·lun humbled + themselves so that they came to Jerusalem. 12 The hand of the [true] God proved to be also in Judah to give them one heart + to perform the commandment + of the king and the princes in the matter of Jehovah. + 13 And they proceeded to gather themselves together at Jerusalem, + a numerous people, to hold the festival + of the unfermented cakes in the second + month, a congregation very multitudinous. 14 Then they rose up and removed the altars + that were in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars + they removed and then threw [them] into the torrent valley of Kidʹron. + 15 After that they slaughtered the passover + victim on the fourteenth [day] of the second month; and the priests and the Levites themselves had been humiliated, so that they sanctified + themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah. 16 And they kept standing + at their place according to their rule, according to the law of Moses the man of the [true] God, * the priests + sprinkling the blood received from the hand of the Levites. 17 For there were many in the congregation that had not sanctified themselves; and the Levites + were in charge of slaughtering the passover victims + for all that were not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah. 18 For there was a great number of the people, many from Eʹphra·im + and Ma·nasʹseh, + Isʹsa·char and Zebʹu·lun, + that had not cleansed + themselves, for they did not eat the passover according to what is written; + but Hez·e·kiʹah prayed for them, + saying: “May the good + Jehovah himself make allowance for 19 every one that has prepared his heart + to search for the [true] God, Jehovah, the God of his forefathers, though without the purification for what is holy.” + 20 Accordingly Jehovah listened to Hez·e·kiʹah and healed the people. + 21 So the sons of Israel that were found in Jerusalem held the festival + of the unfermented cakes seven days with great rejoicing; + and the Levites + and the priests + were offering praise to Jehovah day by day with loud instruments, even to Jehovah. + 22 Moreover, Hez·e·kiʹah spoke to the heart + of all the Levites who were acting with fine discretion toward Jehovah. + And they proceeded to eat the appointed feast for seven days, + sacrificing communion sacrifices + and making confession + to Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 23 Then all the congregation decided + to hold it for seven more days, + and so they held it for seven days with rejoicing. 24 For Hez·e·kiʹah the king of Judah himself contributed + for the congregation a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes + themselves contributed for the congregation a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and priests + kept sanctifying themselves in great number. 25 And all the congregation of Judah + and the priests and the Levites + and all the congregation that came from Israel + and the alien residents * + that came from the land of Israel + and those dwelling in Judah continued rejoicing. + 26 And there came to be great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solʹo·mon + the son of David the king of Israel there was none like this in Jerusalem. + 27 Finally the priests, the Levites, stood up and blessed + the people; and a hearing was granted to their voice, so that their prayer came to his holy dwelling, the heavens. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “voice.” Heb., qohl; Gr., keʹryg·ma, “proclamation; preaching.” Compare Mt 12:41 ftn. ^ Lit., “hand.” ^ “The man of the [true] God .” Heb., ʼish- ha· ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “and the temporary residents .” Heb., wehag· ge·rimʹ ; LXXVg, “proselytes.” Previous Next Print Share Share
