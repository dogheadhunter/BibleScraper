But the sea was for the priests to wash in it. + 7 He then made lampstands + of gold, ten of them of the same plan, + and put them in the temple, five to the right and five to the left. + 8 Further, he made ten tables, and stationed them in the temple, five to the right and five to the left, + and made a hundred bowls of gold. 9 Then he made the courtyard + of the priests + and the great enclosure + and the doors belonging to the enclosure, and their doors he overlaid with copper. 10 And the sea he placed at the right side, to the east, toward the south. + 11 Finally Hiʹram * made the cans + and the shovels + and the bowls. + So Hiʹram finished doing the work that he did for King Solʹo·mon on the house of the [true] God. 12 The two pillars + and the round capitals + upon the top of the two pillars and the two networks + to cover the two round capitals that were upon the top of the pillars 13 and the four hundred pomegranates + for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two round capitals that were upon the pillars, * + 14 and the ten carriages + and the ten basins + upon the carriages; 15 the one sea + and the twelve bulls under it, + 16 and the cans and the shovels + and the forks + and all their utensils + Hiʹram-aʹbiv * + made for King Solʹo·mon for the house of Jehovah, of polished copper. 17 In the District of the Jordan the king cast them in the thick ground * between Sucʹcoth + and Zerʹe·dah. + 18 Thus Solʹo·mon made all these utensils in very great quantity, for the weight of the copper was not ascertained. + 19 And Solʹo·mon proceeded to make all the utensils + that were at the house of the [true] God and the golden altar + and the tables + with the showbread * upon them, 20 and the lampstands + and their lamps + of pure gold, to light them up before the innermost room + according to the rule; 21 and the blossoms and the lamps and the snuffers, + of gold, (it was the purest gold,) 22 and the extinguishers and the bowls and the cups and the fire holders, of pure gold, + and the entrance of the house, + its inner doors for the Most Holy and the doors + of the house of the temple, of gold.
