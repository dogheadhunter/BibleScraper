What shall I give you?” + 8 At that Solʹo·mon said to God: “You are the One that exercised great loving-kindness * toward David my father + and that have made me king in place of him. + 9 Now, O Jehovah God, let your promise with David my father prove faithful, + for you yourself have made me king + over a people as numerous as the dust particles of the earth. + 10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge + that I may go out before this people and that I may come in, + for who could judge this great people of yours?” + 11 Then God said to Solʹo·mon: “For the reason that this has proved to be close to your heart + and you have not asked for wealth, riches and honor or for the soul * of those hating you, neither is it even many days that you have asked for, + but you ask for wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may judge my people over whom I have made you king, + 12 the wisdom and the knowledge are being given you; + also wealth and riches and honor I shall give you such as no kings that were prior to you happened to have, + and such as no one after you will come to have.” + 13 So Solʹo·mon came [from] * the high place that was at Gibʹe·on, + from before the tent of meeting, + to Jerusalem and continued to reign over Israel. + 14 And Solʹo·mon kept gathering chariots and steeds * so that he came to have a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand steeds, + and he kept them stationed in chariot cities + and close by the king at Jerusalem. 15 And the king came to make the silver and the gold in Jerusalem like the stones; + and cedarwood he made like the sycamore trees + that are in the She·pheʹlah * + for great quantity. 16 And there was the export of the horses that Solʹo·mon had from Egypt, + and the company of the king’s merchants would themselves take the horse drove for a price. + 17 And they customarily brought up and exported from Egypt a chariot for six hundred silver pieces and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and that was the way it was for all the kings of the Hitʹtites and the kings of Syria. + It was by means of them that they did the exporting.
