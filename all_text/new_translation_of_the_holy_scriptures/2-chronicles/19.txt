This is how YOU should do that YOU may not incur guilt. 11 And here is Am·a·riʹah the chief priest * over YOU for every matter of Jehovah; + and Zeb·a·diʹah the son of Ishʹma·el the leader of the house of Judah for every matter of the king; and as officers the Levites are available for YOU . Be strong + and act, and let Jehovah + prove to be with what is good.” + Footnotes ^ “The legal cases of the inhabitants of Jerusalem,” by a correction of M and in agreement with LXXVg; M, “the legal case.
