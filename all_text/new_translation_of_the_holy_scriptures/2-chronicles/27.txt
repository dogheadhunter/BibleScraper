And his mother’s name was Je·ruʹshah + the daughter of Zaʹdok. 2 And he kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, + according to all that Uz·ziʹah * his father had done. + Only he did not invade the temple of Jehovah. + However, the people were yet acting ruinously. + 3 He himself built the upper gate + of Jehovah’s house, and on the wall of Oʹphel + he did a great deal of building. 4 And cities + he built in the mountainous region of Judah, + and in the woodlands + he built fortified places + and towers. + 5 And he himself warred against the king of the sons of Amʹmon + and eventually proved stronger than they were, so that the sons of Amʹmon gave him in that year a hundred silver talents * and ten thousand cor * + measures of wheat + and ten thousand of barley. + This was what the sons of Amʹmon paid to him, also in the second year and the third. + 6 So Joʹtham kept strengthening himself, for he prepared his ways before Jehovah his God. + 7 As for the rest of the affairs of Joʹtham + and all his wars and his ways, there they are written in the Book + of the Kings of Israel and of Judah. 8 Twenty-five years old he happened to be when he began to reign, and for sixteen years he reigned in Jerusalem. + 9 Finally Joʹtham lay down with his forefathers, + and they buried him in the City of David. + And Aʹhaz + his son began to reign in place of him.
