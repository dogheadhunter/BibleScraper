And it came about that he rose up by night and went striking down the Eʹdom·ites that were surrounding him and also the chiefs of the chariots. 10 But Eʹdom kept up its revolt from under the hand of Judah down to this day. It was then that Libʹnah + began to revolt at the same time from under his hand, because he had left Jehovah the God of his forefathers. + 11 He himself also had made high places + on the mountains of Judah, that he might cause the inhabitants of Jerusalem to have immoral intercourse, + and that he might drive Judah away. + 12 Eventually there came a writing + to him from E·liʹjah * + the prophet, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather has said, ‘Due to the fact that you have not walked in the ways of Je·hoshʹa·phat + your father or in the ways of Aʹsa + the king of Judah, 13 but you walk in the way of the kings of Israel + and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to have immoral intercourse + the same way that the house of Aʹhab caused the having of immoral intercourse, + and even your own brothers, the household of your father, who were better than you, you have killed; + 14 look! Jehovah is dealing a great blow + to your people + and to your sons + and to your wives and to all your goods. 15 And you will be with many sicknesses, + with a malady of your intestines, until your intestines have come out because of the sickness day by day.’” + 16 Accordingly Jehovah aroused against Je·hoʹram the spirit + of the Phi·lisʹtines + and the Arabs + that were by the side * of the E·thi·oʹpi·ans. * + 17 So they came up into Judah and forced it open and took captive all the goods that were to be found in the king’s house and also his sons + and his wives, + and there was not left to him a son but Je·hoʹa·haz, + his youngest son. 18 And after all this Jehovah plagued him in his intestines with a sickness for which there was no healing. + 19 And it came about that in the days to come, even when the term of two full years had expired, his intestines + came out during his sickness, and he gradually died in his bad maladies; and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning + for his forefathers. 20 Thirty-two years old he happened to be when he began to reign, and for eight years he reigned in Jerusalem. Finally he went away without being desired. + So they buried him in the City of David, + but not in the burial places of the kings. + Footnotes ^ “Azariah.” Heb., ʽAzar·yahʹ . ^ “And Azariah.” Heb., wa·ʽAzar·yaʹhu . ^ “Israel,” M(Heb., Yis·ra·ʼelʹ )Vg; LXXSyVg c and about 40 Heb. mss, “Judah.” ^ “From Elijah.” Heb., me·ʼE·li·yaʹhu; the only mention of Elijah in Chronicles.
