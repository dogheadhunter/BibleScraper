and the priests were loudly sounding the trumpets + in front of them, while all the Israelites were standing. 7 Then Solʹo·mon sanctified + the middle of the courtyard that was before the house of Jehovah, because there he rendered up the burnt offerings + and the fat pieces of the communion sacrifices, for the copper altar + that Solʹo·mon had made was itself not able to contain the burnt offering and the grain offering + and the fat pieces. + 8 And Solʹo·mon proceeded to hold the festival + at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him, + a very great congregation * + from the entering in of Haʹmath + down to the torrent valley of Egypt. + 9 But on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, + because the inauguration of the altar they had held for seven days and the festival for seven days. 10 And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their homes, joyful + and feeling good at heart over the goodness + that Jehovah had performed toward David and toward Solʹo·mon and toward Israel his people. + 11 Thus Solʹo·mon finished the house of Jehovah + and the house of the king; + and in everything that had come into Solʹo·mon’s heart to do regarding the house of Jehovah and his own house he proved successful. 12 Jehovah now appeared + to Solʹo·mon during the night and said to him: “I have heard your prayer, + and I have chosen + this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. + 13 When I shut up the heavens that no rain may occur + and when I command the grasshoppers to eat up the land + and if I send a pestilence among my people, + 14 and my people + upon whom my name + has been called humble + themselves and pray + and seek my face + and turn back from their bad ways, + then I myself shall hear from the heavens + and forgive their sin, + and I shall heal their land. + 15 Now my own eyes + will prove to be opened and my ears + attentive to prayer at this place. 16 And now I do choose + and sanctify this house that my name + may prove to be there to time indefinite, + and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always. + 17 “And if you yourself will walk before me, just as David + your father walked, even by doing according to all that I have commanded you, + and you will keep my regulations + and my judicial decisions, + 18 I will also establish the throne of your kingship, + just as I covenanted with David your father, + saying, ‘There will not a man of yours be cut off from ruling over Israel.’ + 19 But if YOU yourselves turn back + and actually leave my statutes + and my commandments + that I have put before YOU , and YOU actually go and serve other gods + and bow down to them, + 20 I will also uproot them from off my ground that I have given them; + and this house that I have sanctified + for my name, I shall throw away from before my face, + and I shall make it a proverbial saying + and a taunt among all the peoples. + 21 As for this house that had become heaps of ruins, * + everyone passing by it will stare in amazement + and be certain to say, ‘For what reason did Jehovah do like that to this land and to this house?’ + 22 And they will have to say, ‘It was for the reason that they left Jehovah + the God of their forefathers who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, + and they proceeded to take hold of other gods + and bow down to them and serve them. + That is why he brought upon them all this calamity.’” + Footnotes ^ “Congregation.” Heb., qa·halʹ;
