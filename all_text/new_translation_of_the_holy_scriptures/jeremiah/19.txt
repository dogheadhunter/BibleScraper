See App 4C . ^ “Gate of the Potsherds.” Because this gate opened upon the most easterly section of the valley of Hinnom, it is likely identical with the Gate of the Ash-heaps, or the Dung Gate. In Jerusalem in the Old Testament, p. 230, ftn 1, Dr. J. Simons says: “Instead of ‘Gate of the Potsherds’ it is possible to translate ‘Gate of the Potters’, or, better perhaps, ‘Gate of the Earthenware Pots.’ ” ^ “The God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ “To . . . gods .” Heb., l eʼ·lo·himʹ . ^ Lit., “because of there being no place.” ^ See vs 4 ftn. ^ See vs 3 ftn.
