As manure upon the face of the ground they will become.” + 3 “And death will certainly be chosen rather than life + on the part of all the remnant of those remaining out of this bad family in all the places of the remaining ones, where I will have dispersed them,” + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. 4 “And you must say to them, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Will they fall and not get up again? + If one would turn back, will the other not also turn back? + 5 Why is it that this people, Jerusalem, is unfaithful with an enduring unfaithfulness? They have taken hold of trickiness; + they have refused to turn back. + 6 I have paid attention, + and I kept listening. + It was not right the way they kept speaking. There was not a man repenting over his badness, + saying, ‘What have I done?’ Each one is going back into the popular course, + like a horse that is dashing into the battle. 7 Even the stork in the heavens—it well knows its appointed times; + and the turtledove + and the swift and the bulbul—they observe well the time of each one’s coming in. But as for my people, they have not come to know the judgment of Jehovah.”’ + 8 “‘How can YOU men say: “We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with us”? + Surely, now, the false stylus + of the secretaries has worked in sheer falsehood. 9 The wise ones have become ashamed. + They have become terrified and will be caught. Look! They have rejected the very word of Jehovah, and what wisdom do they have? + 10 Therefore I shall give their wives to other men, their fields to those taking possession; + for, from the least one even to the greatest one, each one is making unjust gain; + from the prophet even to the priest, each one is acting falsely. + 11 And they try to heal the breakdown * of the daughter of my people lightly, * + saying: “There is peace! There is peace!” * when there is no peace. + 12 Did they feel shame because they had done even what was detestable? + For one thing, they positively could not feel ashamed; for another thing, they did not know even how to feel humiliated. + “‘Therefore they will fall among those who are falling. In the time of their being given attention, + they will stumble,’ Jehovah has said. + 13 “‘When doing the gathering, I shall bring them to their finish,’ * is the utterance of Jehovah. + ‘There will be no grapes on the vine, + and there will be no figs on the fig tree, and the foliage itself will certainly wither. And things that I give to them will pass by them.’” 14 “Why are we sitting still? Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities + and be silent there. For Jehovah our God * has himself put us to silence, * + and he gives us poisoned water to drink, + because we have sinned against Jehovah. 15 There was a hoping for peace, but no good [came]; + for a time of healing, but, look! terror! + 16 From Dan + has been heard the snorting of his horses. Due to the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land has begun to rock. + And they come in and eat up the land * and what fills it, the city and its inhabitants.” 17 “For here I am sending in among YOU serpents, poisonous snakes, + for which there is no charming, + and they will certainly bite YOU ,” is the utterance of Jehovah. 18 A grief that is beyond curing has come up into me. + My heart is ill. 19 Here there is the sound of the cry for help of the daughter of my people from a land far away: + “Is Jehovah not in Zion? + Or is her king not in her?” + “Why is it that they have offended me with their graven images, with their vain foreign gods?” + 20 “The harvest has passed, the summer has come to an end; but as for us, we have not been saved!” + 21 Over the breakdown + of the daughter of my people I have become shattered. + I have grown sad. Outright astonishment has seized hold of me. + 22 Is there no balsam in Gilʹe·ad? + Or is there no healer there? + Why is it, then, that the recuperation + of the daughter of my people has not come up? + Footnotes ^ Or, “fracture.” ^ Or, “superficially.” ^ See 6:14 ftn, “Peace.” ^ “[When] I shall [or, would] without fail gather them,” by a change of vowel pointing. ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ Or, “put us out of action,” that is, caused us to perish. ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets .
