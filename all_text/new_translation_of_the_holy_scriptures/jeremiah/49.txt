Why is it that Malʹcam * + has taken possession of Gad, * + and his own people have taken up dwelling in [Israel’s] * very cities?” + 2 “‘Therefore, look! there are days coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I will cause the alarm signal of war + to be heard even against Rabʹbah + of the sons of Amʹmon; and she will certainly become a mound of a desolate waste, + and her dependent towns * + themselves will be set aflame in the very fire.’ + “‘And Israel will actually take possession of those in possession of him,’ + Jehovah has said. 3 “‘Howl, + O Heshʹbon, + for Aʹi has been despoiled! Cry out, O dependent towns of Rabʹbah. Gird sackcloth on yourselves. + Wail, and rove about among the stone pens, for Malʹcam himself will go even into exile, + his priests and his princes, all together. + 4 Why do you brag about the low plains, your flowing low plain, + O daughter unfaithful, you the one trusting in her treasures, + [saying:] “Who will come to me?”’” + 5 “‘Here I am bringing in upon you * a dreadful thing,’ + is the utterance of the Sovereign + Lord, Jehovah of armies, ‘from all those round about you. And YOU people will certainly be dispersed, each one in his own direction, + and there will be no one collecting together those running away.’” 6 “‘But afterward I shall gather the captive ones of the sons of Amʹmon,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” 7 For Eʹdom this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Is there no longer any wisdom + in Teʹman? + Has counsel perished from those having understanding? * Has their wisdom gone to putrefying? + 8 Flee! + Let yourselves give way! Go down deep in order to dwell, + O inhabitants of Deʹdan! + For the disaster of Eʹsau I will bring in upon him, the time that I must turn my attention to him. + 9 If grape gatherers themselves actually came in to you, would they not let some gleanings remain? If thieves [came in] by night, they would certainly cause only as much ruin as they wanted. + 10 But as for me, I will strip Eʹsau bare. + I will uncover his places of concealment, + and one will not be able to hide oneself. + His offspring and his brothers and his neighbors will certainly be despoiled, + and he will not be. + 11 Do leave your fatherless boys. + I myself shall preserve [them] alive, and your own widows will trust even in me.” + 12 For this is what Jehovah has said: “Look! Although it is not their custom to drink the cup, they will drink without fail. + And you yourself, will you be absolutely left unpunished? You will not be left unpunished, for you will drink without fail.” + 13 “For by my own self I have sworn,” + is the utterance of Jehovah, “that nothing but an object of astonishment, + a reproach, a devastation and a malediction will Bozʹrah + become; and all her own cities will become devastated places to time indefinite.” + 14 There is a report that I have heard from Jehovah, and there is an envoy that is sent among the nations, [saying:] “Collect yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to battle.” + 15 “For, look! I have made you small indeed among the nations, despised among mankind. * + 16 The shuddering you caused has deceived you, the presumptuousness of your heart, + O you who are residing in the retreats of the crag, holding the height of the hill. Although you build your nest high up just like an eagle, + down from there I shall bring you,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 17 “And Eʹdom must become an object of astonishment. + Everyone passing along by her will stare in astonishment and whistle on account of all her plagues. + 18 Just as in the overthrow of Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah and her neighbor [towns],” + Jehovah has said, “no man will dwell there, and no son of mankind * will reside in her as an alien. + 19 “Look! Someone will come up just like a lion + from the proud [thickets] along the Jordan to the durable abiding place, + but in a moment I will make him run away from her. + And the one who is chosen I shall appoint over her. For who is like me, + and who will challenge me, + and who, now, is the shepherd that can stand before me? + 20 Therefore hear, O men, the counsel of Jehovah that he has formulated against Eʹdom, + and his thoughts that he has thought out against the inhabitants of Teʹman: + Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged about. Surely on account of them he will make their dwelling place become desolate. + 21 At the sound of their falling the earth has begun to rock. + There is an outcry! + The sound of it has been heard even at the Red Sea. + 22 Look! Just like an eagle someone will ascend and pounce down, + and he will spread out his wings over Bozʹrah; + and the heart of the mighty men of Eʹdom will actually become in that day like the heart of the wife having distress in childbirth.” + 23 For Damascus: + “Haʹmath + and Arʹpad + have become ashamed, for it is a bad report that they have heard. They have disintegrated. + In the sea there is anxious care; it is not able to keep undisturbed. + 24 Damascus has lost courage. She has turned to flee, and sheer panic has seized her. + Distress and birth pangs themselves have taken hold of her, as with a woman that is giving birth. + 25 How is it that the city of praise has not been abandoned, the town of exultation? + 26 “Therefore her young men will fall in her public squares, and all the men of war themselves will be brought to silence in that day,” + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. 27 “And I will set a fire ablaze on the wall of Damascus, and it will certainly devour the dwelling towers of Ben-haʹdad.” + 28 For Keʹdar + and the kingdoms of Haʹzor, + which Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar the king of Babylon struck down, + this is what Jehovah has said: “Rise up, go up to Keʹdar, O men, and despoil the sons of the East. + 29 Their own tents + and their own flocks + will be taken, their tent cloths + and all their articles. And their own camels + will be carried off from them. And they will certainly cry out to them, ‘Fright is all around!’” + 30 “Flee, take flight far away; go down deep in order to dwell, O inhabitants of Haʹzor,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “For Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar the king of Babylon + has formulated a counsel even against YOU and has thought out against YOU * a thought.” 31 “Rise up, O men, go up against the nation that is at ease, + dwelling in security!” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “No doors and no bar does it have. Solitary they reside. + 32 And their camels + must become a plunder, and the multitude of their livestock a spoil. And I will scatter them to every wind, + those who have their hair clipped at the temples; + and from all regions near it I shall bring in their disaster,” is the utterance of Jehovah. 33 “And Haʹzor + must become the lair of jackals, + a desolate waste to time indefinite. No man * will dwell there, and in her no son of mankind * will reside as an alien.” + 34 This is what occurred as the word of Jehovah to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Eʹlam + in the beginning of the kingship of Zed·e·kiʹah + the king of Judah, saying: 35 “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Here I am breaking the bow of Eʹlam, + the beginning of their mightiness. 36 And I will bring in upon Eʹlam the four winds from the four extremities of the heavens. + And I will scatter them to all these winds, + and there will prove to be no nation to which the dispersed + ones of Eʹlam * will not come.’” 37 “And I will shatter the Eʹlam·ites before their enemies and before those seeking for their soul; and I will bring upon them a calamity, my burning anger,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “And I will send after them the sword until I shall have exterminated them.” + 38 “And I will set my throne in Eʹlam, + and I will destroy out of there the king and the princes,” is the utterance of Jehovah. 39 “And it will certainly occur in the final part of the days + that I shall gather the captive ones of Eʹlam,” + is the utterance of Jehovah.
