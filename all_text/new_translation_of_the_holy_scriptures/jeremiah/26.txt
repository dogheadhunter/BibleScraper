Did he not fear Jehovah and proceed to soften the face of Jehovah, + so that Jehovah got to feeling regret for the calamity that he had spoken against them? + So we are working up a great calamity against our souls. * + 20 “And there also happened to be a man * prophesying in the name of Jehovah, U·riʹjah * the son of She·maiʹah * from Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim. + And he kept prophesying against this city and against this land in accord with all the words of Jeremiah. 21 And King Je·hoiʹa·kim + and all his mighty men and all the princes got to hear his words, and the king began seeking to put him to death. + When U·riʹjah got to hear [of it] he at once became afraid + and ran away and came into Egypt. 22 But King Je·hoiʹa·kim sent men to Egypt, El·naʹthan the son of Achʹbor + and other men with him to Egypt. 23 And they proceeded to bring U·riʹjah out from Egypt and to bring him to King Je·hoiʹa·kim, who then struck him down with the sword + and cast his dead body into the graveyard of the sons of the people.” 24 Moreover, it was the hand of A·hiʹkam + the son of Shaʹphan + that proved to be with Jeremiah, in order not to give him into the hand of the people to have him put to death. + Footnotes ^ “To this man .” Heb., la· ʼishʹ haz·zehʹ . ^ See vs 11 ftn. ^ Lit., “men.” Heb., ʼana·shimʹ, pl. of ʼish . ^ “Micah,” ­M margin and a number of Heb. mss; M, “Mi­cai­ah.” ^ Or, “the Morashtite.” ^ See Isa 36:1 ftn. ^ “Our souls .” Heb., naph·shoh·th ehʹnu . ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Meaning “My Light Is Jehovah.” Heb., ʼU·ri·yaʹhu; found only here and in vss 21, 23. ^ Meaning “Jehovah Has Heard.” Heb., Shemaʽ·yaʹhu .
