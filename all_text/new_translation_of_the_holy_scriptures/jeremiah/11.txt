At that time will you exult? + 16 ‘A luxuriant olive tree, pretty with fruit [and] in form,’ is what Jehovah has called your name. + With sound of the great roaring, he has set a fire blazing against her, and they have broken its branches. + 17 “And Jehovah of armies himself, the Planter of you, * + has spoken against you a calamity on account of the badness of the house of Israel + and the house of Judah that they have committed on their own part to offend me in making sacrificial smoke to Baʹal.” + 18 And Jehovah himself has informed me that I may know. At that time you caused me to see their dealings. + 19 And I was like a male lamb, an intimate one, that is brought to slaughter, + and I did not know that it was against me that they thought out schemes: + “Let us bring to ruin the tree with its food, and let us cut him off from the land of the living ones, + that his very name may no more be remembered.” 20 But Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; + he is examining the kidneys * and the heart. + O may I see your vengeance on them, for it is to you that I have revealed my case at law. + 21 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said against the men of Anʹa·thoth + who are seeking for your soul, * saying: “You must not prophesy in the name of Jehovah, + that you may not die at our hand”; 22 therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Here I am turning my attention upon them. The young men themselves will die by the sword. + Their sons and their daughters themselves will die by the famine. + 23 And not even a remnant will there come to be for them, because I shall bring calamity upon the men of Anʹa·thoth, + the year of their being given attention.” + Footnotes ^ See 1:1 ftn, “Jeremiah.” ^ “Men of.” Heb., ʼish, sing. but used collectively. ^ “The man .” Heb., ha· ʼishʹ . ^ Lit., “to God.” Heb., lEʼ·lo·himʹ, pl. ^ Or, “So be it.” Heb., ʼa·menʹ . ^ “Gods.” Heb., ʼelo·himʹ . ^ Or, “hear.” ^ “The gods .” Heb., ha· ʼelo·himʹ . ^ “In regard to their calamity,” M; TLXXSyVg and 34 Heb. mss, “in the time of their calamity.” ^ “You,” fem. sing. ^ Or, “deepest emotions.” Heb., kela·yohthʹ . ^ “Seeking for your soul,” MSyVg; LXX, “seeking for my soul”; T, “seeking to put you to death.” Previous Next Print Share Share
