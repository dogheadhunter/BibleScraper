They are all the workmanship of skilled people. + 10 But Jehovah is in truth God. * + He is the living God + and the King to time indefinite. + Because of his indignation the earth will rock, + and no nations will hold up under his denunciation. + 11 This is what YOU men will say to them: “The gods * + that did not make the very heavens and the earth are the ones who will perish from the earth + and from under these heavens.” * 12 He * is the Maker of the earth by his power, + the One firmly establishing the productive land * by his wisdom, + and the One who by his understanding stretched out the heavens. + 13 At [his] voice there is a giving by him of a turmoil of waters in the heavens, + and he causes vapors * to ascend from the extremity * of the earth. + He has made even sluices * for the rain, + and he brings forth the wind * from his storehouses. + 14 Every man * has behaved so unreasoningly as not to know. + Every metalworker will certainly feel shame because of the carved image; + for his molten image is a falsehood, + and there is no spirit * in them. + 15 They are vanity, * a work of mockery. + In the time of their being given attention they will perish. + 16 The Share of Jacob + is not like these things, for he is the Former of everything, + and Israel is the staff * of his inheritance. + Jehovah of armies is his name. + 17 Gather up from the earth your pack load, + O woman dwelling under stress. + 18 For this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am slinging out the inhabitants of the earth * on this occasion, + and I will cause them distress in order that they may find out.” + 19 Woe to me on account of my breakdown! + My stroke has become sickish. * And I myself have said: “Surely this is my sickness, and I shall carry it. + 20 My own tent has been despoiled, and my own tent cords have all been torn in two. + My own sons have gone forth from me, and they are no more. + There is no one stretching out my tent anymore or raising up my tent cloths. 21 For the shepherds have behaved unreasoningly, + and they have not looked even for Jehovah. + That is why they have not acted with insight, and all their pastured animals have been scattered.” + 22 Listen! A report! Here it * has come, also a great pounding from the land of the north, + in order to make the cities of Judah a desolate waste, the lair of jackals. + 23 I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man * his way does not belong. It does not belong to man * who is walking even to direct his step. + 24 Correct me, O Jehovah, however with judgment; + not in your anger, + that you may not reduce me to nothing. + 25 Pour out your rage upon the nations + who have ignored you, * + and upon the families who have not called even upon your name. + For they have eaten up Jacob. + Yes, they have eaten him up, and they keep at exterminating him; + and his abiding place they have desolated. + Footnotes ^ Or, “statutes.” Sy, “objects of fear; idols.” ^ “Uphaz,” MVg; TThSy, “Ophir.” ^ “Is in truth God .” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ ʼemethʹ . ^ “The gods .” Aram., ʼela·hai· yaʼʹ .
