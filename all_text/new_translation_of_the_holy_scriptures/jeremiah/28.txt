May Jehovah establish your words that you have prophesied by bringing back the utensils of the house of Jehovah and all the exiled people from Babylon to this place! + 7 However, hear, please, this word that I am speaking in your ears and in the ears of all the people. + 8 As regards the prophets that happened to be prior to me and prior to you from long ago, + they also used to prophesy concerning many lands and concerning great kingdoms, of war and of calamity * and of pestilence. + 9 As regards the prophet that prophesies of peace, + when the word of the prophet comes true the prophet whom Jehovah has sent in truth will become known.” + 10 At that Han·a·niʹah the prophet took the yoke bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. + 11 And Han·a·niʹah + went on to say before the eyes of all the people: “This is what Jehovah has said, + ‘Just like this I shall break the yoke of Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar the king of Babylon within two full years more from off the neck of all the nations.’” + And Jeremiah the prophet proceeded to go his way. + 12 Then the word of Jehovah occurred to Jeremiah, + after Han·a·niʹah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying: 13 “Go, * and you must say to Han·a·niʹah, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Yoke bars + of wood you have broken, and instead of them you will have to make yoke bars of iron.” + 14 For this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “A yoke of iron I will put upon the neck of all these nations, to serve Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar the king of Babylon; + and they must serve him. + And even the wild beasts of the field I will give him.”’” + 15 And Jeremiah the prophet went on to say to Han·a·niʹah + the prophet: “Listen, please, O Han·a·niʹah! Jehovah has not sent you, but you yourself have caused this people to trust in a falsehood. + 16 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said, ‘Look! I am sending you away from off the surface of the ground. This year you yourself must die, + for you have spoken outright revolt against Jehovah.’” + 17 So Han·a·niʹah the prophet died in that year, in the seventh month. + Footnotes ^ See 27:12 ftn. ^ Or, “So be it!” Heb., ʼa·menʹ . ^ “Calamity,” MTSyVg; 23 Heb. mss, “famine.” ^ See 2:2 ftn, “Go.” Previous Next Print Share Share
