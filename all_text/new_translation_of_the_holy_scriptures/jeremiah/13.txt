Do not be haughty, + for Jehovah himself has spoken. + 16 Give to Jehovah YOUR God * glory, + before he causes darkness + and before YOUR feet strike up against each other on the mountains at dusk. + And YOU will certainly hope for the light, + and he will actually make it deep shadow; + he will turn [it] into thick gloom. + 17 And if YOU will not hear it, + in places of concealment my soul will weep because of pride and will positively shed tears; and my eye will run down with tears, + because the drove + of Jehovah will have been carried captive. 18 “Say to the king and to the lady, + ‘Seat yourselves in a lower place, + for down from YOUR heads * YOUR crown of beauty will certainly come.’ + 19 The cities of the south * themselves have been shut up, so that there is no one opening [them]. Judah in its entirety has been taken into exile. It has been taken into exile completely. + 20 “Raise your * eyes * and see those who are coming from the north. + Where is the drove that one gave to you, * your beautiful flock? + 21 What will you say when one * turns his attention upon you, + when you yourself have taught them as confidential friends right alongside you at the start? + Will not birth pangs themselves seize hold of you, like those of a wife * giving birth? + 22 And when you will say in your heart, + ‘Why is it that these things have befallen me?’ + because of the abundance of your error your skirts have been taken off as a cover; + your heels have been treated violently. 23 “Can a Cushʹite * + change his skin? or a leopard its spots? + Y OU yourselves would also be able to do good, who are persons taught to do bad. + 24 So I shall scatter them + like stubble that is passing along in the wind from the wilderness. + 25 This is your * lot, your measured portion from me,” + is the utterance of Jehovah, “because you have forgotten me + and you keep putting your trust in falsehood. + 26 And I myself also will lift up your skirts over your face, and your dishonor will certainly be seen, + 27 your acts of adultery + and your neighings, + your loose conduct in prostitution. Upon the hills, in the field, I have seen your disgusting things. + Woe to you, O Jerusalem! You cannot be clean + —after how much longer?” + Footnotes ^ See 2:2 ftn, “Go.” ^ “Gods.” Heb., ʼelo·himʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “The God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ, pl. ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eh·khemʹ . ^ “From your heads,” by a correction in agreement with LXXSyVg. ^ Or, “the Negeb.” ^ “Your,” sing., by a correction in agreement with LXX; MSyVg, “your,” pl. ^ LXX adds, “O Jerusalem.” ^ “You,” fem. sing. ^ Or, “he.” LXX, “they.” ^ Or, “woman.” ^ “Ethiopian,” LXXVg. ^ “Your,” fem. sing.
