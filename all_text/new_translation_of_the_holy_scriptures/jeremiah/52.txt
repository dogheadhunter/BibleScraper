+ and as regards all the men of war, they began to run away + and go forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden, + while the Chal·deʹans were all around against the city; and they kept going by the way of the Arʹa·bah. + 8 And a military force of the Chal·deʹans went chasing after the king, + and they got to overtake Zed·e·kiʹah + in the desert plains of Jerʹi·cho; and all his own military force was scattered from his side. + 9 Then they seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon + at Ribʹlah + in the land of Haʹmath, + that he might pronounce upon him judicial decisions. + 10 And the king of Babylon proceeded to slaughter the sons of Zed·e·kiʹah before his eyes, + and also all the princes of Judah he slaughtered in Ribʹlah. + 11 And the eyes of Zed·e·kiʹah he blinded, + after which the king of Babylon bound him with copper fetters and brought him to Babylon + and put him in the house of custody until the day of his death. 12 And in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, that is, [in] the nineteenth year of King Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar, + the king of Babylon, Neb·uʹzar·adʹan + the chief of the bodyguard, who was standing before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. 13 And he proceeded to burn the house of Jehovah + and the house of the king and all the houses of Jerusalem; + and every great house he burned with fire. + 14 And all the walls of Jerusalem, round about, all the military forces of the Chal·deʹans that were with the chief of the bodyguard pulled down. + 15 And some of the lowly ones of the people and the rest of the people that were left remaining in the city + and the deserters that had fallen away to the king of Babylon and the rest of the master workmen Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the bodyguard took into exile. + 16 And some of the lowly ones of the land Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the bodyguard let remain as vinedressers and as compulsory laborers. + 17 And the copper pillars + that belonged to the house of Jehovah and the carriages + and the copper sea + that was in the house of Jehovah the Chal·deʹans broke to pieces and went carrying all the copper of them to Babylon. + 18 And the cans and the shovels + and the extinguishers + and the bowls + and the cups and all the copper utensils with which they used to minister they took. + 19 And the basins + and the fire holders and the bowls + and the cans and the lampstands + and the cups and the bowls that were of genuine gold, + and those that were of genuine silver, + the chief of the bodyguard took. + 20 And the two pillars, + the one sea, + and the twelve copper bulls + that were under [the sea], the carriages, * that King Solʹo·mon had made for the house of Jehovah. + There happened to be no weight [taken] of the copper of them—all these articles. + 21 And as regards the pillars, eighteen cubits * in height was each pillar, + and a thread of twelve cubits itself would go around it; + and its thickness was four fingerbreadths, * it being hollow. 22 And the capital upon it was of copper, + and the height of the one capital was five cubits; + and as regards the network and the pomegranates upon the capital, all around, + the whole was of copper; and the second pillar had just the same as these, also the pomegranates. + 23 And the pomegranates came to be ninety-six, on the sides, * all the pomegranates being one hundred upon the network round about. + 24 Furthermore, the chief of the bodyguard took Se·raiʹah + the chief priest and Zeph·a·niʹah + the second priest and the three doorkeepers, + 25 and from the city he took one court official that happened to be commissioner over the men of war, and seven men of those having access to the king, * + who were found in the city, and the secretary of the chief of the army, the one mustering the people of the land, * and sixty men * of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city. + 26 So these Neb·uʹzar·adʹan + the chief of the bodyguard took and conducted them to the king of Babylon at Ribʹlah. + 27 And these the king of Babylon proceeded to strike down + and to put them to death in Ribʹlah + in the land of Haʹmath. + Thus Judah went into exile from off its soil. + 28 These are the people whom Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar took into exile: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews. + 29 In the eighteenth year of Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar, + from Jerusalem there were eight hundred and thirty-two souls. 30 In the twenty-third year of Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar, Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the bodyguard took Jews into exile, seven hundred and forty-five souls. + All the souls were four thousand and six hundred. * 31 At length it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Je·hoiʹa·chin + the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Eʹvil-merʹo·dach the king of Babylon, in the year of his becoming king, * raised up the head + of Je·hoiʹa·chin the king of Judah and proceeded to bring him forth from the prison house. 32 And he began to speak with him good things and to put his throne * higher than the thrones of the [other] kings that were with him in Babylon. + 33 And he took off * his prison garments, + and he ate bread + before him constantly all the days of his life. + 34 And as for his allowance, there was a constant allowance given him from the king of Babylon, daily as due, * until the day of his death, + all the days of his life.
