There are days coming,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I shall certainly carry out the good word that I have spoken, + concerning the house of Israel + and concerning the house of Judah. 15 In those days and at that time I shall make sprout for David a righteous sprout, + and he will certainly execute justice and righteousness in the land. * + 16 In those days Judah will be saved + and Jerusalem itself will reside in security. + And this is what she will be called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.’” * + 17 “For this is what Jehovah has said, ‘There will not be cut off in David’s case a man to sit * upon the throne of the house of Israel. + 18 And in the case of the priests, the Levites, * there will not be cut off a man from before me to offer up whole burnt offering and to make smoke with a grain offering and to render sacrifice always.’” * + 19 And the word of Jehovah came further to Jeremiah, saying: 20 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘If YOU people could break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, even in order for day and night not to occur in their time, + 21 likewise could my own covenant be broken with David my servant + so that he should not come to have a son ruling as king upon his throne; + also with the Levites, the priests, my ministers. + 22 Just as the army of the heavens cannot be counted, neither the sand of the sea be measured, + so I shall multiply the seed of David my servant and the Levites who are ministering to me.’” + 23 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to Jeremiah, saying: 24 “Have you not seen what those of this people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families whom Jehovah has chosen, + he will also reject them’? And my own people they keep treating with disrespect, + so that it should no more continue being a nation before them. 25 “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘If it was not a fact that I had appointed my own covenant of the day and night, + the statutes of heaven and earth, + 26 so too I would reject even the seed of Jacob and of David my servant, + so that I should not take from his seed * rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I shall gather their captives + and will have pity upon them.’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “it,” fem. ^ “You,” masc. sing. ^ “The men .” Heb., ha· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “his loyal love .” Heb., chas·d ohʹ . ^ Or, “in the earth .” Heb., ba· ʼaʹrets . ^ See 23:6 ftn. ^ Lit., “a man sitting.” Heb., ʼish yo·shevʹ . ^ Lit., “ all the days .” Heb., kol- hai· ya·mimʹ . ^ Or, “the Levite priests.” ^ Or, “offspring; posterity.” Previous Next Print Share Share
