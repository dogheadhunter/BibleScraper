Against her they pitched [their] tents all around. + They grazed off each one his own part. + 4 Against her they have sanctified war: + “Rise up, and let us go up at midday!” + “Woe to us, for the day has declined, for the shadows of evening keep extending themselves!” 5 “Rise up, and let us go up during the night and bring to ruin her dwelling towers.” + 6 For this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Cut down wood * + and throw up against Jerusalem a siege rampart. + She is the city with which an accounting must be held. + She is nothing but oppression in the midst of her. + 7 As a cistern keeps its waters cool, so she has kept her badness cool. Violence and despoiling are heard in her; + sickness and plague are before my face constantly. 8 Be corrected, + O Jerusalem, that my soul may not turn away disgusted from you; + that I may not set you as a desolate waste, a land not inhabited.” + 9 This is what Jehovah of armies has said: “They will without fail glean the remnant of Israel just like a vine. + Put your hand back like one that is gathering grapes upon the vine tendrils.” 10 “To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Look! Their ear is uncircumcised, so that they are unable to pay attention. + Look! The very word of Jehovah has become to them a reproach, + in which * [word] they can take no delight. + 11 And with the rage of Jehovah I have become full. I have become weary with holding in.” + “Pour [it] out upon the child in the street + and upon the intimate group of young men at the same time; for they will also be caught, a man * along with his wife, * an old man along with one that is full of days. + 12 And their houses will certainly be turned over to others for possession, the fields and the wives at the same time. + For I shall stretch my hand out against the inhabitants of the land,” is the utterance of Jehovah. + 13 “For from the least one of them even to the greatest one of them, every one is making for himself unjust gain; + and from the prophet even to the priest, each one is acting falsely. + 14 And they try to heal the breakdown * of my people lightly, * + saying, ‘There is peace! There is peace!’ * when there is no peace. + 15 Did they feel shame because it was something detestable that they had done? + For one thing, they positively do not feel any shame; for another thing, they have not come to know even how to feel humiliated. + Therefore they will fall among those who are falling; + in the time that I must hold an accounting with them they will stumble,” Jehovah has said. 16 This is what Jehovah has said: “Stand still in the ways, YOU people, and see, and ask for the roadways of long ago, where, now, the good way is; + and walk in it, + and find ease for YOUR souls.” + But they kept saying: “We are not going to walk.” + 17 “And I raised up over YOU people * watchmen, + ‘Pay attention to the sound of the horn!’” + But they kept saying: “We are not going to pay attention.” + 18 “Therefore hear, O YOU nations! And know, O you assembly, what will be among them. 19 Listen, O earth! Here I am bringing in calamity upon this people + as the fruitage of their thoughts, + for they paid no attention to my very own words; and my law—they also kept rejecting it.” + 20 “What does this matter to me that you bring in even frankincense from Sheʹba + and the good cane * from the land far away? The whole burnt offerings of YOU people serve for no pleasure, + and YOUR very sacrifices have not been gratifying to me.” + 21 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am setting for this people stumbling blocks, + and they will certainly stumble over them, fathers and sons together; the neighbor and his companion—they will perish.” + 22 This is what Jehovah has said: “Look! A people is coming from the land of the north, and there is a great nation that will be awakened from the remotest parts of the earth. + 23 The bow and the javelin they will grab hold of. + It * is a cruel one, and they will have no pity. Their very voice will resound just like the sea, + and upon horses they will ride. + It is drawn up in battle order like a man of war against you, O daughter of Zion.” + 24 We have heard the report about it. * Our hands have dropped. + Distress itself has seized hold of us, labor pains like those of a woman giving birth. + 25 Do not go out * into the field, and do not walk even in the way; for there is the sword belonging to the enemy, there is fright all around. + 26 O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth + and wallow in the ashes. + Make your mourning that for an only [son], the wailing of bitterness; + because suddenly the despoiler will come upon us. + 27 “I have made you * a metal tester among my people, one making a thorough search; * and you will take note and you must examine * their way. + 28 All of them are the most stubborn men, * + walking about as slanderers + —copper and iron. They are all of them ruinous. + 29 The bellows + have been scorched. * Out from their fire there is lead. + One has kept refining intensely simply for nothing, and those who are bad have not been separated. + 30 Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them, + for Jehovah has rejected them.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “shofar.” ^ “Wood,” MT; LXXSyVg, “her trees.” ^ “Which,” referring to the “very word,” both masc. sing. ^ Or, “husband.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “woman.” Heb., ʼish·shahʹ . ^ Or, “fracture.” ^ Or, “superficially.” ^ Or, “saying, ‘Perfect peace!’ ” Lit., “saying, ‘Peace!
