Here I actually do not know how to speak, + for I am but a boy.” * + 7 And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Do not say, ‘I am but a boy.’ But to all those to whom I shall send you, you should go; and everything that I shall command you, you should speak. + 8 Do not be afraid because of their faces, + for ‘I am with you to deliver you,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” 9 At that Jehovah thrust his hand out and caused it to touch my mouth. + Then Jehovah said to me: “Here I have put my words in your mouth. + 10 See, I have commissioned you this day to be over the nations and over the kingdoms, + in order to uproot and to pull down and to destroy and to tear down, + to build and to plant.” + 11 And the word of Jehovah continued to occur to me, saying: “What are you seeing, Jeremiah?” So I said: “An offshoot * of an almond tree * is what I am seeing.” 12 And Jehovah went on to say to me: “You have seen well, for I am keeping awake * concerning my word in order to carry it out.” + 13 And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to me the second time, saying: “What are you seeing?” So I said: “A widemouthed cooking pot blown upon * is what I am seeing, and its mouth * is away from the north.” 14 At this Jehovah said to me: “Out of the north the calamity will be loosened against all the inhabitants of the land. + 15 For ‘here I am calling for all the families of the kingdoms of the north,’ is the utterance of Jehovah; + ‘and they will certainly come and place each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, + and against all her walls round about and against all the cities of Judah. + 16 And I will speak with them my judgments over all their badness, + in that they have left me + and they keep making sacrificial smoke to other gods * + and bowing down to the works of their own hands.’ + 17 “And as for you, you should gird up your hips, + and you must rise up and speak to them everything that I myself command you. Do not be struck with any terror because of them, + in order that I may not strike you with terror before them. 18 But as for me, here I have made you today a fortified city and an iron pillar and copper walls + against all the land, + toward the kings of Judah, toward her princes, toward her priests and toward the people of the land. * + 19 And they will be certain to fight against you, but they will not prevail against you, + for ‘I am with you,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to deliver you.’” + Footnotes ^ Meaning “My Portion Is Jehovah.” Heb., Chil·qi·yaʹhu . ^ Meaning “Jehovah Loosens [the womb]”; or, “Jehovah Exalts.” Heb., Yir·meyaʹhu . ^ “Of Zedekiah.” Heb., leTsidh·qi·yaʹhu, meaning “Jehovah Is Righteousness.” ^ Or, “young person.” Heb., naʹʽar . ^ Or, “staff; rod.” Compare 1Sa 17:40, 43 . ^ “An almond tree.” Heb., sha·qedhʹ, “awakening one”; one of the first trees to bloom in the spring. ^ “Am keeping awake.” Heb., sho·qedhʹ, corresponding to sha·qedhʹ in vs 11. ^ “Blown upon,” as respects the fire underneath.
