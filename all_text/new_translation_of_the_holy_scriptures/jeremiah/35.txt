But in tents YOU should dwell all YOUR days, in order that YOU may keep living many days upon the surface of the ground where YOU are residing as aliens.’ + 8 So we keep obeying the voice of Je·honʹa·dab * the son of Reʹchab our forefather in everything that he commanded + us by drinking no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons and our daughters, + 9 and by not building houses for us to dwell in, so that no vineyard or field or seed should become ours. 10 And we keep dwelling in tents and obeying and doing according to all that Jonʹa·dab + our forefather commanded us. + 11 But it came about when Neb·u·chad·rezʹzar the king of Babylon came up against the land + that we began to say, ‘Come, and let us enter into Jerusalem because of the military force of the Chal·deʹans and because of the military force of the Syrians, * and let us dwell in Jerusalem.’” + 12 And the word of Jehovah proceeded to occur to Jeremiah, saying: 13 “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Go, and you must say to the men * of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “Did YOU not continually receive exhortation to obey my words?” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 14 “There has been a carrying out of the words of Je·honʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab, + that he commanded his sons, to drink no wine, and they have drunk none down to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their forefather. + And as for me, I have spoken to YOU men, rising up early and speaking, + but YOU have not obeyed me. + 15 And I kept sending to YOU all my servants the prophets, + rising up early and sending [them], saying, ‘Turn back, please, each one from his bad way, + and make YOUR dealings good, + and do not walk after other gods to serve them. + And keep dwelling on the ground that I have given to YOU and to YOUR forefathers.’ + But YOU did not incline YOUR ear, nor did YOU listen to me. + 16 But the sons of Je·honʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab + have carried out the commandment of their forefather that he commanded them; + but as for this people, they have not listened to me.”’” + 17 “Therefore this is what Jehovah, the God of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am bringing upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the calamity that I have spoken against them, + for the reason that I have spoken to them but they did not listen, and I kept calling to them but they did not answer.’” + 18 And to the household of the Reʹcha·bites Jeremiah said: “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, ‘For the reason that YOU have obeyed the commandment of Je·honʹa·dab + YOUR forefather and continue keeping all his commandments and doing according to all that he commanded YOU , + 19 therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said: “There will not be cut off from Jonʹa·dab the son of Reʹchab a man to stand * + before me always.”’” * + Footnotes ^ See 2:2 ftn, “Go.” ^ Meaning “Great Is Jehovah.” Heb., Yigh·dal·yaʹhu . ^ “A man of the [true] God .” Heb., ʼish ha· ʼElo·himʹ .
