The utensils of the house of Jehovah are being brought back from Babylon soon now!” + For falsehood is what they are prophesying to YOU . + 17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and keep on living. + Why should this city become a devastated place? + 18 But if they are prophets and if the word of Jehovah does exist with them, let them, please, beseech Jehovah of armies, + that the utensils that are remaining over in the house of Jehovah and the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem may not come into Babylon.’ 19 “For this is what Jehovah of armies has said concerning the pillars + and concerning the sea + and concerning the carriages + and concerning the remainder of the utensils that are remaining over in this city, + 20 that Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar the king of Babylon had not taken when he carried Jec·o·niʹah * + the son of Je·hoiʹa·kim, the king of Judah, into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; + 21 for this is what Jehovah of armies, the God * of Israel, has said concerning the utensils that are remaining over at the house of Jehovah and the house of the king of Judah and Jerusalem, + 22 ‘“To Babylon is where they will be brought + and there they will continue to be until the day of my turning my attention to them,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “And I will bring them up and restore them to this place.”’” + Footnotes ^ “Jehoiakim,” MTLXXVg; Sy, the Arabic version and three Heb. mss, “Zed­e­ki­ah,” as in vss 3, 12. ^ Heb., Yir·meyahʹ . ^ Meaning “Jehovah Is Righteousness.” Heb., Tsidh·qi·yaʹhu . ^ “Their masters .” Heb., ʼadho·n eh·khemʹ, pl. of ʼa·dhohnʹ, to denote more than one. ^ Or, “men.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Nebuchadnezzar,” in 27:6–29:3 ; in 21:2 and elsewhere throughout the book, “Nebuchadrezzar.” ^ “Babylon,” LXXVg; MTSy, “Babel.” ^ “Dreamers,” TLXXSyVg; M, “dreams.” ^ “Zedekiah.” Heb., Tsidh·qi·yahʹ .
