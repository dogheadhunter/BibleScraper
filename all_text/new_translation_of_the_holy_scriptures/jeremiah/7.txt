My anger and my rage are being poured forth upon this place, + upon mankind * and upon domestic animal, and upon the tree of the field + and upon the fruitage of the ground; and it must burn, and it will not be extinguished.’ + 21 “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God * of Israel, has said, ‘Add those whole burnt offerings of YOURS to YOUR sacrifices and eat flesh. + 22 For I did not speak with YOUR forefathers, nor did I command them in the day of my bringing them out from the land of Egypt concerning the matters of whole burnt offering and sacrifice. + 23 But this word I did express in command upon them, saying: “Obey my voice, + and I will become YOUR God, + and YOU yourselves will become my people; and YOU must walk in all the way + that I shall command YOU , in order that it may go well with YOU .”’ + 24 But they did not listen, neither did they incline their ear, + but they went walking in the counsels in the stubbornness of their bad heart, + so that they became backward in direction and not forward, + 25 from the day that YOUR forefathers came forth out of the land of Egypt until this day; + and I kept sending to YOU all my servants the prophets, daily getting up early and sending [them]. + 26 But they did not listen to me, and they did not incline their ear, + but they kept hardening their neck. + They acted worse than their forefathers! + 27 “And you must speak to them all these words, + but they will not listen to you; and you must call to them, but they will not answer you. + 28 And you must say to them, ‘This is the nation whose people have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah its God, + and have not taken discipline. + Faithfulness has perished, and it has been cut off from their mouth.’ + 29 “Shear off your * uncut hair * and throw [it] away, + and upon the bare hills raise a dirge, + for Jehovah has rejected + and will desert the generation with which he is furious. * + 30 ‘For the sons of Judah have done what is bad in my eyes,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. ‘They have set their disgusting things in the house upon which my name has been called, in order to defile it. + 31 And they have built the high places of Toʹpheth, + which is in the valley of the son of Hinʹnom, * + in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, + a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.’ + 32 “‘Therefore, look! days are coming,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘when it will no more be said [to be] Toʹpheth and the valley of the son of Hinʹnom, but the valley of the killing; + and they will have to bury in Toʹpheth without there being enough place. * + 33 And the dead bodies of this people must become food for the flying creatures of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth, with nobody to make [them] tremble. + 34 And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of exultation and the voice of rejoicing, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; + for the land will become nothing but a devastated place.’” + Footnotes ^ See 1:1 ftn, “Jeremiah.” ^ “The God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ Lit., “words [or, things] of falsehood.” ^ “Temple of.” Heb., heh·khalʹ; Gr., na·osʹ; Lat., temʹplum .
