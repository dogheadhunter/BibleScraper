As the clay in the hand of the potter, so YOU are in my hand, O house of Israel. + 7 At any moment that I may speak against a nation and against a kingdom to uproot [it] and to pull [it] down and to destroy [it], + 8 and that nation actually turns back from its badness against which I spoke, + I will also feel regret over the calamity that I had thought to execute upon it. + 9 But at any moment that I may speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build [it] up and to plant [it], + 10 and it actually does what is bad in my eyes by not obeying my voice, + I will also feel regret over the good that I said [to myself] to do for its good.’ 11 “And now say, please, to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am forming against YOU a calamity and thinking against YOU a thought. + Turn back, please, each one from his bad way, and make YOUR ways and YOUR dealings good.”’” + 12 And they said: “It is hopeless! + For after our own thoughts we shall walk, and we are going to carry out each one the stubbornness of his bad heart.” + 13 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said: “Ask for yourselves, please, among the nations. Who has heard things like these? There is a horrible thing that the virgin of Israel has done to an excess. + 14 Will the snow of Lebʹa·non go away from the rock of the open field? Or will strange waters, cool, trickling, be dried up? 15 For my people have forgotten me + in that they make sacrificial smoke to something worthless, + and in that they make men stumble in their ways, + the paths of long ago, + to walk in roadways, a way not banked up, 16 in order to make their land an object of astonishment, + for whistling at to time indefinite. + Every last one passing along by it will stare in astonishment and shake his head. + 17 As with an east wind I shall scatter them before the enemy. + The back, and not the face, + I shall show them in the day of their disaster.” 18 And they proceeded to say: “Come, men, and let us think out against Jeremiah some thoughts, + for the law will not perish from the priest + or counsel from the wise one or the word from the prophet. + Come and let us strike him with the tongue, + and let us pay no attention to any of his words.” 19 Do pay attention to me, O Jehovah, and listen to the voice of my opponents. * + 20 Should bad be repaid for good? + For they have excavated a pit for my soul. + Remember my standing before you to speak good even concerning them, to turn back your rage from them. + 21 Therefore give their sons over to the famine, + and deliver them over to the power * of the sword; + and may their wives become women bereaved of children, and widows. + And may their own men become those killed with deadly plague, their young men those struck down with the sword in the battle. + 22 Let a cry be heard out of their houses, when you bring upon them suddenly a marauder band. + For they have excavated a pit to capture me, and traps they have hid for my feet. + 23 But you yourself, O Jehovah, well know all their counsel against me for [my] death. + Do not cover over * their error, and do not wipe out that sin of theirs from before you; but let them become those who are made to stumble before you. + In the time of your anger take action against them. + Footnotes ^ See 1:1 ftn, “Jeremiah.” ^ Lit., “former”; or, “one forming.” See vs 11. ^ Or, “contenders.” LXX, “pleading”; Sy, “oppression.” ^ Lit., “hands.” ^ Or, “Do not make atonement for .” Heb., ʼal-te khap·perʹ .
