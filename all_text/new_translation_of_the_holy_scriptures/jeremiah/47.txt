Waters are coming + up from the north + and have become a flooding torrent. And they will flood the land and what fills it, the city and those inhabiting it. + And the men * will certainly cry out, and everyone dwelling in the land must howl. + 3 At the sound of the stamping of the hoofs of his stallions, + at the rattling of his war chariots, + the turmoil of his wheels, + the fathers will actually not turn around to the sons, because of the dropping down of [their] hands, 4 on account of the day that is coming to despoil all the Phi·lisʹtines, + to cut off from Tyre + and from Siʹdon + every survivor that was helping. + For Jehovah is despoiling the Phi·lisʹtines, + who are the remaining ones from the island of Caphʹtor. + 5 Baldness + must come to Gaʹza. + Ashʹke·lon + has been put to silence. O remnant of their low plain, how long will you keep making cuts upon yourself? + 6 “Aha, the sword of Jehovah! + How long will you not stay quiet? Be shoved * into your sheath. + Take your repose and keep silent. 7 “How can it stay quiet, when Jehovah himself has given a command to it? It is for Ashʹke·lon and for the coast of the sea. + There is where he has designated it * to be.” Footnotes ^ Or, “the earthling men .” Heb., ha· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “Be gathered.” ^ “It,” fem. sing., referring to the “sword.” Previous Next Print Share Share
