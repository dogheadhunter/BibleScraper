I have grown weary because of my sighing, and no resting-place have I found.”’ + 4 “This is what you should say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting, even all the land itself. + 5 But as for you, you keep seeking great things for yourself. + Do not keep on seeking.”’ + “‘For here I am bringing in a calamity upon all flesh,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I will give you your soul as a spoil in all the places to which you may go.’” + Footnotes Previous Next Print Share Share
