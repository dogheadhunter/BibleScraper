I am unable to enter into the house of Jehovah. + 6 And you yourself must enter in and read aloud from the roll that you have written at my mouth the words of Jehovah + in the ears of the people at the house of Jehovah in the day of fast; + and also in the ears of all Judah who are coming in from their cities you should read them aloud. + 7 Perhaps their request for favor will fall before Jehovah + and they will return, each one from his bad way, + for great is the anger and the rage that Jehovah has spoken against this people.” + 8 And Barʹuch + the son of Ne·riʹah proceeded to do according to all that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him, to read aloud from the book + the words of Jehovah at the house of Jehovah. + 9 Now it came about in the fifth year of Je·hoiʹa·kim + the son of Jo·siʹah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, + that all the people in Jerusalem and all the people that were coming in from the cities of Judah into Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before Jehovah. + 10 And Barʹuch began to read aloud from the book the words of Jeremiah at the house of Jehovah, in the dining room + of Gem·a·riʹah * + the son of Shaʹphan + the copyist, + in the upper courtyard, at the entrance of the new gate of the house of Jehovah, + in the ears of all the people. 11 And Mi·caiʹah * the son of Gem·a·riʹah the son of Shaʹphan + got to hear all the words of Jehovah from out of the book. 12 At that he went down to the house of the king, to the dining room of the secretary, and, look! there is where all the princes were sitting, E·lishʹa·ma + the secretary and De·laʹiah * + the son of She·maiʹah * and El·naʹthan + the son of Achʹbor + and Gem·a·riʹah + the son of Shaʹphan + and Zed·e·kiʹah the son of Han·a·niʹah * and all the other princes. 13 And Mi·caiʹah + proceeded to tell them all the words that he had heard when Barʹuch read aloud from the book in the ears of the people. + 14 Then all the princes sent out to Barʹuch + Je·huʹdi + the son of Neth·a·niʹah * the son of Shel·e·miʹah * the son of Cushʹi, saying: “The roll from which you read aloud in the ears of the people—take it in your hand and come.” Accordingly Barʹuch the son of Ne·riʹah * took the roll in his hand and came in to them. + 15 Then they said to him: “Sit down, please, and read it aloud in our ears.” So Barʹuch + read aloud in their ears. 16 Now it came about that as soon as they heard all the words, they looked at one another in dread; and they proceeded to say to Barʹuch: “We shall without fail tell the king all these words.” + 17 And Barʹuch they asked, saying: “Tell us, please, How did you write all these words from his mouth?” + 18 Then Barʹuch said to them: “Out of his mouth he kept declaring to me all these words, and I was writing in the book with ink.” + 19 Finally the princes said to Barʹuch: “Go, conceal yourself, you and Jeremiah, so that no one at all will know where YOU men are.” + 20 Then they came in to the king, to the courtyard, + and the roll they entrusted to the dining room + of E·lishʹa·ma + the secretary; and they began to tell all the words in the ears of the king. 21 So the king sent Je·huʹdi + out to get the roll. Accordingly he got it out of the dining room of E·lishʹa·ma + the secretary. + And Je·huʹdi began to read it aloud in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes standing by the king. 22 And the king was sitting in the winter house, + in the ninth month, * + with a brazier + burning before him. 23 Then it came about that as soon as Je·huʹdi had read three or four page-columns, he proceeded to tear it apart with the secretary’s knife, pitching [it] also into the fire that was in the brazier until all the roll ended up in the fire that was in the brazier. + 24 And they felt no dread; + neither did the king and all his servants, who were listening to all these words, rip their garments apart. + 25 And even El·naʹthan + and De·laʹiah * + and Gem·a·riʹah * + themselves pleaded with the king not to burn the roll, but he did not listen to them. + 26 Further, the king commanded Je·rahʹme·el the son of the king and Se·raiʹah * the son of Azʹri·el and Shel·e·miʹah * the son of Abʹde·el to get Barʹuch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet. + But Jehovah kept them concealed. + 27 And the word of Jehovah occurred further to Jeremiah after the king had burned up the roll with the words that Barʹuch + had written at the mouth of Jeremiah, + saying: 28 “Take again for yourself a roll, another one, and write on it all the first words that proved to be on the first roll, which Je·hoiʹa·kim the king of Judah burned up. + 29 And against Je·hoiʹa·kim the king of Judah you should say, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “You yourself have burned up this roll, + saying, ‘Why is it that you have written on it, + saying: “The king of Babylon will come without fail and will certainly bring this land to ruin and cause man * and beast to cease from it”?’ + 30 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said against Je·hoiʹa·kim the king of Judah, ‘He will come to have no one sitting upon the throne of David, + and his own dead body will become something thrown out + to the heat by day and to the frost by night. 31 And I will call to account against him + and against his offspring and against his servants their error, + and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men * of Judah all the calamity that I have spoken against them, + and they did not listen.’”’” + 32 And Jeremiah himself took another roll and then gave it to Barʹuch the son of Ne·riʹah, the secretary, + who proceeded to write upon it at the mouth + of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Je·hoiʹa·kim the king of Judah had burned in the fire; + and there were added to them many more words like those.
