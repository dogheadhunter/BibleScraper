Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, + and all faces have turned pale? + 7 Alas! For that day is a great one, + so that there is no other like it, + and it is the time of distress for Jacob. + But he will be saved even out of it.” 8 “And it must occur in that day,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, “that I shall break one’s yoke from off your neck, and your bands I shall tear in two, + and no more will strangers exploit him as a servant. 9 And they will certainly serve Jehovah their God and David their king, + whom I shall raise up for them.” + 10 “And as for you, do not be afraid, O my servant Jacob,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and do not be struck with terror, O Israel. + For here I am saving you from far off and your offspring from the land of their captivity. + And Jacob will certainly return and be free of disturbance and be at ease, and there will be no one causing trembling.” + 11 “For I am with you,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “to save you; + but I shall make an extermination among all the nations to which I have scattered you. + However, in your case I shall make no extermination. + And I shall have to correct you to the proper degree, as I shall by no means leave you unpunished.” + 12 For this is what Jehovah has said: “There is no cure for your * breakdown. + Your stroke is chronic. + 13 There is no one pleading your cause, for [your] ulcer. + There are no means of healing, no mending, for you. + 14 All those intensely loving you are the ones that have forgotten you. + You are not the one for whom they keep searching. For with the stroke of an enemy I have struck you, + with the chastisement of someone cruel, + on account of the abundance of your error; + your sins have become numerous. + 15 Why do you cry out on account of your breakdown? + Your pain is incurable on account of the abundance of your error; your sins have become numerous. + I have done these things to you. 16 Therefore all those devouring you will themselves be devoured; + and as for all your adversaries, into captivity they will all of them go. + And those pillaging you * will certainly come to be for pillaging, and all those plundering you I shall give over to plundering.” + 17 “For I shall bring up a recuperation for you, and from your strokes I shall heal you,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “For a woman chased away is what they called you: + ‘That is Zion, for whom no one is searching.’” + 18 This is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am gathering the captive ones of the tents of Jacob, + and for his tabernacles I shall have pity. And the city will actually be rebuilt upon her mound; + and upon its rightful site the dwelling tower itself will sit. + 19 And from them there will certainly go forth thanksgiving, and the sound of those who are laughing. + And I will multiply them, and they will not become few; + and I will make them heavy in number, and they will not become insignificant. + 20 And his sons must become as in former times, and before me his own assembly will be firmly established. + And I will turn my attention upon all his oppressors. + 21 And his majestic one will certainly come to be from him, + and from the midst of him his own ruler will go forth; + and I will cause him to come near, and he must approach to me.” + “For who, now, is this one that has given his heart in pledge in order to approach to me?” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 22 “And YOU will certainly become my people, + and I myself shall become YOUR God.” + 23 Look! A windstorm of Jehovah, rage itself, has gone forth, an onward-sweeping tempest. * + Upon the head of the wicked ones it will whirl. + 24 The burning anger of Jehovah will not turn back until he will have executed and until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart. + In the final part of the days YOU people will give YOUR consideration to it. + Footnotes ^ “Your,” fem. sing., referring to the city of Zion. ^ See vs 12 ftn. ^ Or, “a roaring tempest.” Previous Next Print Share Share
