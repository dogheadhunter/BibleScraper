You have refused to feel humiliated. + 4 Have you from now on called out to me, ‘My Father, + you are the confidential friend of my youth! + 5 Should one stay resentful to time indefinite, or keep watching [something] forever?’ + Look! You have spoken, and you went on to do bad things and prevail.” + 6 And Jehovah proceeded to say to me in the days of Jo·siʹah the king: + “‘Have you seen what unfaithful Israel * has done? + She is going upon every high mountain + and underneath every luxuriant tree, + that she may commit prostitution there. + 7 And after her doing all these things I kept saying that she should return even to me, but she did not return; + and Judah kept looking at her own treacherous sister. + 8 When I got to see that, for the very reason that unfaithful Israel had committed adultery, I sent her away + and proceeded to give the certificate of her full divorce to her, + yet treacherously dealing Judah her sister did not become afraid, but she herself also began to go and commit prostitution. + 9 And her prostitution occurred because of [her] frivolous view, and she kept polluting the land + and committing adultery with stones and with trees; + 10 and even for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, + only falsely,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” 11 And Jehovah went on to say to me: “Unfaithful Israel has proved her own soul to be more righteous than treacherously dealing Judah. + 12 Go, * and you must proclaim these words to the north + and say: “‘“Do return, O renegade Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’ + ‘“I shall not have my face drop [angrily] upon YOU people, + for I am loyal,” + is the utterance of Jehovah.’ ‘“I shall not stay resentful to time indefinite. + 13 Only take note of your error, for it is against Jehovah your God * that you * have transgressed. + And you continued scattering your ways to the strangers + under every luxuriant tree, + but to my voice YOU people did not listen,” is the utterance of Jehovah.’” 14 “Return, O YOU renegade sons,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. “For I myself have become the husbandly owner of YOU people; + and I will take YOU , one out of a city and two out of a family, and I will bring YOU to Zion. + 15 And I will give YOU shepherds in agreement with my heart, + and they will certainly feed * YOU with knowledge and insight. + 16 And it must occur that YOU will become many and certainly bear fruit in the land * in those days,” is the utterance of Jehovah. + “No more will they say, ‘The ark of the covenant of Jehovah!’ + nor will it come up into the heart, nor will they remember it + or miss it, and no more will it be made. 17 In that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah; + and to her all the nations must be brought together + to the name of Jehovah at Jerusalem, + and they will no more walk after the stubbornness of their bad heart.” + 18 “In those days they will walk, the house of Judah alongside * the house of Israel, + and together + they will come out of the land of the north into the land that I gave as a hereditary possession to YOUR * forefathers. + 19 And I myself have said, ‘O how I proceeded to place you * among the sons and to give you the desirable land, + the hereditary possession of the ornament of the armies of the nations!’ And I further said, ‘“My Father!” + YOU people will call out to me, and from following me YOU people will not turn back.’ 20 ‘Truly [as] a wife * has treacherously gone from her companion, + so YOU , O house of Israel, have dealt treacherously with me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” 21 On the beaten paths there has been heard a sound, the weeping, the entreaties of the sons of Israel. For they have twisted their way; + they have forgotten Jehovah their God. * + 22 “Return, YOU renegade sons. + I shall heal YOUR renegade condition.” * + “Here we are! We have come to you, for you, O Jehovah, are our God. + 23 Truly the hills as well as the turmoil on the mountains + belong to falsehood. + Truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel. + 24 But the shameful thing + itself has eaten up the toil of our forefathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 25 We lie down in our shame, + and our humiliation keeps covering us; + for it is toward Jehovah our God that we have sinned, + we and our fathers from our youth on and down to this day, + and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.” + Footnotes ^ “You,” fem. sing., addressed to Jerusalem, or Zion. ^ “Land,” MTSy; LXXVg, “woman.” ^ “His wife ( woman ).” Heb., ʼish·t ohʹ . ^ Or, “husband.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “Raped,” M; M margin , “lain with.” ^ Lit., “the unfaithfulness (apostasy), Israel,” thus terming Israel a concrete example of unfaithfulness, or apostasy. ^ See 2:2 ftn, “Go.” ^ “You,” fem. sing. ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aʹyikh, pl. ^ Or, “shepherd.” ^ “In the land ( earth ).” Heb., ba· ʼaʹrets . ^ Or, “up to.” ^ “Your,” pl., MVg; TLXXSy, “their.” ^ “You,” fem. sing. ^ Or, “woman.” Heb., ʼish·shahʹ . ^ “Their God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eh·hemʹ, pl. ^ Or, “your state of unfaithfulness.” Lit., “your unfaithfulnesses.” Previous Next Print Share Share
