You used your strength against me, so that you prevailed. + I became an object of laughter all day long; everyone is holding me in derision. + 8 For as often as I speak, I cry out. Violence and despoiling are what I call out. + For the word of Jehovah became for me a cause for reproach and for jeering all day long. + 9 And I said: “I am not going to make mention of him, and I shall speak no more in his name.” + And in my heart it proved to be like a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I got tired of holding in, and I was unable [to endure it]. * + 10 For I heard the bad report of many. + There was fright all around. * “T ELL out, that we may tell out about him.” + Every mortal man bidding me “Peace!” * —they are watching for my limping: + “Perhaps he will be fooled, + so that we may prevail against him and take our revenge upon him.” 11 But Jehovah was with me + like a terrible mighty one. + That is why the very ones persecuting me will stumble and not prevail. + They will certainly be put to much shame, because they will not have prospered. [Their] indefinitely lasting humiliation will be one that will not be forgotten. + 12 But you, O Jehovah of armies, are examining the righteous one; + you are seeing the kidneys * and the heart. + May I see your vengeance upon them, + for to you I have revealed my case at law. + 13 Sing to Jehovah, YOU people! Praise Jehovah! For he has delivered the soul of the poor one out of the hand of evildoers. + 14 Cursed be the day on which I was born! May the day that my mother gave me birth not become blessed! + 15 Cursed be the man * that brought good news to my father, saying: “There has been born to you a son, a male!” He positively made him rejoice. + 16 And that very man must become like cities that Jehovah has overthrown while He has felt no regret. + And he must hear an outcry in the morning and an alarm signal at the time of midday. + 17 Why did he not definitely put me to death from the womb, that my mother should become to me my burial place and her womb be pregnant to time indefinite? + 18 Why is it that I have come forth from the very womb + in order to see hard work and grief + and that my days should come to their end in mere shame? + Footnotes ^ “Pashhur.” According to the Judeo-Aramaic derivation this name means “What Remains Round About” (Heb., pash, “it remains” and sechohrʹ, “round about”). ^ “Fright all around.” Or, “Magormissabib.” Heb., Ma·ghohrʹ mis·sa·vivʹ . ^ Or, “friends.” ^ “Babylon,” LXXVg; MTSy, “Babel.” ^ “To endure it,” in agreement with LXXVg. ^ “Fright all around.” Heb., ma·ghohrʹ mis·sa·vivʹ . Compare vs 3 ftn, “Around.” ^ Lit., “mortal man [Heb., ʼenohshʹ ] of my peace.” ^ See 11:20 ftn. ^ “The man .” Heb., ha· ʼishʹ . Previous Next Print Share Share
