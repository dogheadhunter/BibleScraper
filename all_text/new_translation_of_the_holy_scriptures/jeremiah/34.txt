Here I am proclaiming to YOU a liberty,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘to the sword, + to the pestilence + and to the famine, + and I shall certainly give YOU for a quaking to all the kingdoms of the earth. + 18 And I will give the men * sidestepping my covenant, + in that they did not carry out the words of the covenant that they concluded * before me [with] the calf that they cut in two + that they might pass between its pieces; + 19 [namely,] the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, + the court officials and the priests and all the people of the land * who went passing between the pieces of the calf— 20 yes, I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking for their soul; + and their dead bodies must become food for the flying creatures of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth. + 21 And Zed·e·kiʹah the king of Judah + and his princes I shall give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those seeking for their soul and into the hand of the military forces of the king of Babylon + who are withdrawing from against YOU men.’ + 22 “‘Here I am commanding,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I shall certainly bring them back to this city, + and they must fight against it and capture it and burn it with fire; + and the cities of Judah I shall make a desolate waste without an inhabitant.’” + Footnotes ^ See 2:2 ftn, “Go.” ^ Or, “release.” Heb., derohrʹ . ^ Or, “slaves.” ^ “Seven,” MTSyVg; LXX, “six.” ^ Or, “where they wish.” Lit., “free to their soul.” Compare De 21:14 ftn. ^ “The men .” Heb., ha· ʼana·shimʹ , pl. of ʼish . ^ Lit., “they cut .” Heb., kor·th uʹ; the same as for cutting the calf. ^ “The people of the land .” Heb., ʽam ha· ʼaʹrets .
