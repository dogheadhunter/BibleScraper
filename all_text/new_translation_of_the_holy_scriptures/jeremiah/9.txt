They have taught their tongue to speak falsehood. + They have tired themselves out merely in doing wrong. + 6 “Your sitting is in the midst of deception. + Through deception they have refused to know me,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 7 Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said: “Here I am smelting them, and I have to examine them, + because how otherwise shall I act on account of the daughter of my people? + 8 Their tongue is a slaughtering arrow. * + Deception is what it has spoken. With his mouth, peace is what [a person] keeps speaking with his own companion; but within himself he sets his ambush.” + 9 “Because of these things should I not hold an accounting with them?” is the utterance of Jehovah. “Or upon a nation that is like this should not my soul avenge itself? + 10 Over the mountains I shall raise a weeping and lamentation, + and over the pasture grounds of the wilderness a dirge; for they will have been burned + so that there is no man passing through and people actually will not hear the sound of livestock. + Both the flying creature of the heavens and the beast will have fled; they will have gone. + 11 And I will make Jerusalem piles of stones, + the lair of jackals; + and the cities of Judah I shall make a desolate waste, without an inhabitant. + 12 “Who is the man that is wise, that he may understand this, even the one to whom the mouth of Jehovah has spoken, that he may tell it? + On what account should the land actually perish, be actually burned like the wilderness without anyone passing through?” + 13 And Jehovah proceeded to say: “On account of their leaving my law that I gave [to be] before them, and [because] they have not obeyed my voice and have not walked in it, * + 14 but they kept on walking after the stubbornness of their heart + and after the Baʹal images, * + about which their fathers had taught them; + 15 therefore this is what Jehovah of armies, the God * of Israel, has said, ‘Here I am making them, that is, this people, eat wormwood, + and I will make them drink poisoned water; + 16 and I will scatter them among the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, + and I will send after them the sword until I shall have exterminated them.’ + 17 “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Behave with understanding, YOU people, and call the dirge-chanting women, + that they may come; and send even to the skilled * women, that they may come, + 18 and that they may hurry and raise up over us a lamentation. And may our eyes run down with tears and our own beaming eyes trickle with waters. + 19 For the voice of lamentation is what has been heard from Zion: + “How we have been despoiled! + How much we have felt shame! For we have left the land; for they * have thrown away our residences.” * + 20 But hear, O YOU women, the word of Jehovah, and may YOUR ear take the word of his mouth. Then teach YOUR daughters a lamentation, + and each woman her companion a dirge. + 21 For death has come up through our windows; it has come into our dwelling towers, in order to cut off the child from the street, the young men from the public squares.’ + 22 “Speak, ‘This is what the utterance of Jehovah is: “The dead bodies of mankind * must also fall like manure upon the face of the field and like a row of newly cut grain after the reaper, with no one to do the gathering up.”’” + 23 This is what Jehovah has said: “Let not the wise man brag about himself because of his wisdom, + and let not the mighty man brag about himself because of his mightiness. + Let not the rich man brag about himself because of his riches.” + 24 “But let the one bragging about himself brag about himself because of this very thing, the having of insight + and the having of knowledge of me, that I am Jehovah, + the One exercising loving-kindness, justice * and righteousness in the earth; + for in these things I do take delight,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 25 “Look! Days are coming,” is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I will hold an accounting with everyone circumcised [but still] in uncircumcision, * + 26 upon Egypt + and upon Judah + and upon Eʹdom + and upon the sons of Amʹmon + and upon Moʹab + and upon all those with hair clipped at the temples who are dwelling in the wilderness; + for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.” + Footnotes ^ MLXX end chapter 8 here with this as vs 23. ^ “Adulterers.” Lat., a·dulʹte·ri . ^ Or, “earth.” ^ “A slaughtering arrow,” M; M margin , “a hammered arrow”; by another derivation, “an arrow from a special wood [bow].” ^ “It,” fem. sing., referring to the “law.” ^ Or, “the Baals.” ^ “The God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ Lit., “wise.” ^ Or, “for our residences have been thrown away,” in agreement with Vg. ^ “They,” MSy; LXX, “we.” ^ Or, “men.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “judgment.” Heb., mish·patʹ . ^ Or, “in [his] foreskin,” a sign of uncircumcision.
