I have prepared my dinner, + my bulls and fattened animals are slaughtered, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast.”’ + 5 But unconcerned they went off, one to his own field, another to his commercial business; + 6 but the rest, laying hold of his slaves, treated them insolently and killed them. + 7 “But the king grew wrathful, and sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. + 8 Then he said to his slaves, ‘The marriage feast indeed is ready, but those invited were not worthy. + 9 Therefore go to the roads leading out of the city, and anyone * YOU find invite to the marriage feast.’ + 10 Accordingly those slaves went out to the roads and gathered together all they found, both wicked and good; + and the room for the wedding ceremonies was filled with those reclining + at the table. 11 “When the king came in to inspect the guests he caught sight there of a man not clothed with a marriage garment. + 12 So he said to him, ‘Fellow, how did you get in here not having on a marriage garment?’ + He was rendered speechless. 13 Then the king said to his servants, * ‘Bind him hand and foot and throw him out into the darkness outside. There is where [his] weeping and the gnashing * of [his] teeth will be.’ + 14 “For there are many invited, but few chosen.” + 15 Then the Pharisees went their way and took counsel together in order to trap him in his speech. + 16 So they dispatched to him their disciples, together with party followers of Herod, * + saying: “Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care for anybody, for you do not look upon men’s outward appearance. + 17 Tell us, therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to pay head tax to Caesar * or not?” + 18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: “Why do YOU put me to the test, hypocrites? + 19 Show me the head tax coin.” They brought him a de·narʹi·us. * 20 And he said to them: “Whose image * and inscription is this?” + 21 They said: “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them: “Pay back, * therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” + 22 Well, when they heard [that], they marveled, and leaving him they went off. + 23 On that day Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, * came up to him and asked him: + 24 “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If any man dies without having children, his brother must take his wife in marriage and raise up offspring for his brother.’ + 25 Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and deceased, and, not having offspring, he left his wife for his brother. + 26 It went the same way also with the second and the third, until through all seven. + 27 Last of all the woman died. 28 Consequently, in the resurrection, to which of the seven will she be wife? For they all got her.” + 29 In reply Jesus said to them: “Y OU are mistaken, because YOU know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God; + 30 for in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, + but are as angels in heaven. 31 As regards the resurrection of the dead, did YOU not read what was spoken to YOU by God, saying, + 32 ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? + He is the God, * not of the dead, but of the living.” + 33 On hearing [that], the crowds were astounded at his teaching. + 34 After the Pharisees heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they came together in one group. 35 And one of them, versed in the Law, + asked, testing him: 36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” + 37 He said to him: “‘You must love Jehovah * your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ + 38 This is the greatest and first commandment. 39 The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ + 40 On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.” + 41 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together Jesus asked them: + 42 “What do YOU think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him: “David’s.” + 43 He said to them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration * + calls him ‘Lord,’ saying, 44 ‘Jehovah * said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet”’? + 45 If, therefore, David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?” + 46 And nobody was able to say a word in reply to him, nor did anyone dare from that day on to question him any further. + Footnotes ^ Or, “as many as.” ^ Or, “to his ministers ( attendants ).” Gr., tois di·a·koʹnois ; Lat., mi·niʹstris ; J 22 (Heb.), la m·sha·rethimʹ . ^ Or, “grinding; clenching.” ^ Or, “with the Herodians.” ^ Or, “to the Emperor.” Gr., Kaiʹsa·ri; Lat., Caeʹsa·ri; J 22 (Heb.), laq·Qeh·sarʹ . ^ See 20:2 ftn. ^ “Image.” Gr., ei·konʹ; Lat., i·maʹgo; J 22 (Heb.), had ·demuthʹ , “the image .” ^ Lit., “Give you back.” Gr., A·poʹdo·te; Lat., redʹdi·te; J 17,​22 (Heb.), tenuʹ . ^ “Resurrection.” Gr., a·naʹsta·sin, “raising up; standing up” (from a·naʹ, “up,” and staʹsis, “standing”); Lat., re·sur·rec·ti·oʹnem; J 17 (Heb.), techi·yathʹ ham· me·thimʹ , “ revival of the dead .” ^ “He is the God,” B; J 18 , “Jehovah is God.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “in spirit .” Gr., en pneuʹma·ti ; Lat., in spiʹri·tu ; J 17,​18 (Heb.), ba· ruʹach . ^ See App 1D .
