During the time his mother Mary was promised + in marriage to Joseph, she was found to be pregnant by holy spirit + before they were united. 19 However, Joseph her husband, because he was righteous and did not want to make her a public spectacle, + intended to divorce * + her secretly. 20 But after he had thought these things over, look! Jehovah’s * angel appeared to him in a dream, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife home, for that which has been begotten in her is by holy spirit. + 21 She will give birth to a son, and you must call his name Jesus, * + for he will save + his people + from their sins.” + 22 All this actually came about for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah * + through his prophet, + saying: 23 “Look! The virgin * + will become pregnant and will give birth to a son, and they will call his name Im·manʹu·el,” * + which means, when translated, “With Us Is God.” + 24 Then Joseph woke up from his sleep and did as the angel of Jehovah * had directed him, and he took his wife home. 25 But he had no intercourse + with her * until she gave birth to a son; + and he called his name Jesus. + Footnotes ^ Or, “line of descent; origin.” Gr., ge·neʹse·os, “genesis”; Lat., ge·ne·ra·ti·oʹnis, “generation”; J 17,​18 (Heb.), toh·ledhothʹ, “geneology.” See Ge 2:4 and Ge 5:1 ftns, “History.” ^ Lit., “generated.” Gr., e·genʹne·sen; Lat., geʹnu·it, “begat.” ^ Or, “by her who had belonged to Uriah.” ^ WH omits Ahaziah, Jehoash, Amaziah.
