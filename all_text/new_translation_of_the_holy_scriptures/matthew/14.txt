He was raised up from the dead, and this is why the powerful works * are operating in him.” + 3 For Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him away in prison on account of He·roʹdi·as the wife of Philip his brother. + 4 For John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to be having her.” + 5 However, although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they took him for a prophet. + 6 But when Herod’s birthday + was being celebrated the daughter of He·roʹdi·as danced at it and pleased Herod so much 7 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. + 8 Then she, under her mother’s coaching, said: “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.” + 9 Grieved though he was, the king out of regard for his oaths and for those reclining with him commanded it to be given; + 10 and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. 11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the maiden, and she brought it to her mother. + 12 Finally his disciples came up and removed the corpse and buried him + and came and reported to Jesus. 13 At hearing this Jesus withdrew from there by boat into a lonely place for isolation; + but the crowds, getting to hear of it, followed him on foot from the cities. 14 Now when he came forth he saw a great crowd; and he felt pity + for them, and he cured their sick ones. + 15 But when evening fell his disciples came to him and said: “The place is lonely and the hour is already far advanced; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves things to eat.” + 16 However, Jesus said to them: “They do not have to leave: YOU give them something to eat.” + 17 They said to him: “We have nothing here but five loaves and two fishes.” + 18 He said: “B RING them here to me.” 19 Next he commanded the crowds to recline on the grass and took the five loaves and two fishes, and, looking up to heaven, he said a blessing + and, after breaking the loaves, he distributed them to the disciples, the disciples in turn to the crowds. + 20 So all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the surplus of fragments, twelve baskets full. + 21 Yet those eating were about five thousand men, besides women and young children. + 22 Then, without delay, he compelled his disciples to board the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away. + 23 Eventually, having sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. + Though it became late, he was there alone. 24 By now the boat was many hundreds of yards * away from land, being hard put to it by the waves, + because the wind was against them. 25 But in the fourth watch period * of the night he came to them, walking over the sea. + 26 When they caught sight of him walking on the sea, the disciples were troubled, saying: “It is an apparition!” + And they cried out in their fear. 27 But at once Jesus spoke to them with the words: “Take courage, it is I; + have no fear.” 28 In reply Peter said to him: “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.” 29 He said: “Come!” Thereupon Peter, getting down off the boat, + walked over the waters and went toward Jesus. 30 But looking at the windstorm, he got afraid and, after starting to sink, he cried out: “Lord, save me!” 31 Immediately stretching out his hand Jesus caught hold of him and said to him: “You with little faith, why did you give way to doubt?” + 32 And after they got up into the boat, the windstorm abated. 33 Then those in the boat did obeisance to him, saying: “You are really God’s Son.” + 34 And they got across and came to land in Gen·nesʹa·ret. + 35 Upon recognizing him the men of that place sent forth into all that surrounding country, and people brought him all those who were ill. + 36 And they went entreating him that they might just touch the fringe of his outer garment; + and all those who touched it were made completely well.
