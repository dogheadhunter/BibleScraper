It is no longer usable for anything but to be thrown outside + to be trampled on by men. 14 “Y OU are the light of the world. + A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. 15 People light a lamp and set it, not under the measuring basket, + but upon the lampstand, and it shines upon all those in the house. 16 Likewise let YOUR light + shine before men, that they may see YOUR fine works + and give glory + to YOUR Father who is in the heavens. 17 “Do not think I came to destroy the Law + or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill; + 18 for truly I say to YOU that sooner would heaven and earth pass away + than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place. + 19 Whoever, therefore, breaks + one of these least commandments and teaches mankind to that effect, he will be called ‘least’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. + As for anyone who does them and teaches + them, this one will be called ‘great’ + in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. 20 For I say to YOU that if YOUR righteousness does not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, + YOU will by no means enter + into the kingdom of the heavens. 21 “Y OU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder; + but whoever commits a murder + will be accountable to the court of justice.’ + 22 However, I say to YOU that everyone who continues wrathful + with his brother will be accountable + to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt * will be accountable to the Supreme Court; * whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Ge·henʹna. * + 23 “If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar + and you there remember that your brother has something against you, + 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go away; first make your peace with your brother, + and then, when you have come back, offer up your gift. + 25 “Be about settling matters quickly with the one complaining against you at law, while you are with him on the way there, that somehow the complainant + may not turn you over to the judge, and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison. 26 I say to you for a fact, You will certainly not come out from there until you have paid over the last coin of very little value. * + 27 “Y OU heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’ + 28 But I say to YOU that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman + so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery + with her in his heart. + 29 If, now, that right eye of yours is making you stumble, tear it out and throw it away from you. + For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost to you than for your whole body to be pitched + into Ge·henʹna. 30 Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. + For it is more beneficial to you for one of your members to be lost than for your whole body to land in Ge·henʹna. 31 “Moreover it was said, ‘Whoever divorces + his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ + 32 However, I say to YOU that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, * + makes her a subject for adultery, + and whoever marries a divorced * woman commits adultery. * + 33 “Again YOU heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not swear + without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.’ * + 34 However, I say to YOU : Do not swear + at all, neither by heaven, because it is God’s throne; + 35 nor by earth, because it is the footstool + of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city + of the great King. 36 Nor by your head must you swear, because you cannot turn one hair white or black. 37 Just let YOUR word Yes mean Yes, YOUR No, No; + for what is in excess of these is from the wicked one. * + 38 “Y OU heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’ + 39 However, I say to YOU : Do not resist him that is wicked; * but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, + turn the other also to him. 40 And if a person wants to go to court with you and get possession of your inner garment, let your outer garment also go to him; + 41 and if someone under authority impresses you into service for a mile, * go with him two miles. + 42 Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from one that wants to borrow from you [without interest]. + 43 “Y OU heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor + and hate your enemy.’ + 44 However, I say to YOU : Continue to love YOUR enemies + and to pray for those persecuting YOU ; + 45 that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, + since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. + 46 For if YOU love those loving YOU , what reward do YOU have? + Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? 47 And if YOU greet YOUR brothers only, what extraordinary thing are YOU doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing? 48 Y OU must accordingly be perfect, as YOUR heavenly Father is perfect. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “those who are beggars for the spirit.” ^ “Happy.” Gr., Ma·kaʹri·oi; Lat., be·aʹti, the basis for the term “beatitudes.” ^ Lit., “peacemakers.” Gr., ei·re·no·poi·oiʹ . ^ “An unspeakable word of contempt.” Gr., Rha·kaʹ; J 17 , Re·qaʼʹ, an Aram. word of contempt. ^ Or, “the Sanhedrin.” ^ “Gehenna.” Gr., γέενναν ( geʹen·nan ); J 1-14,​16-18 (Heb.), גיהנם ( geh·hin·nomʹ, “valley of Hinnom”).
