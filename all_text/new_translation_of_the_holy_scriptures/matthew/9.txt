But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away + from them, and then they will fast. + 16 Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old outer garment; for its full strength would pull from the outer garment and the tear would become worse. + 17 Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. + But people put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.” + 18 While he was telling them these things, look! a certain ruler + who had approached began to do obeisance to him, + saying: “By now my daughter must be dead; + but come and lay your hand upon her and she will come to life.” + 19 Then Jesus, getting up, began to follow him; also his disciples did. 20 And, look! a woman suffering twelve years from a flow of blood + came up behind and touched the fringe * of his outer garment; + 21 for she kept saying to herself: “If I only touch his outer garment I shall get well.” * + 22 Jesus turned around and, noticing her, said: “Take courage, daughter; your faith has made you well.” * + And from that hour the woman became well. + 23 When, now, he came into the ruler’s house + and caught sight of the flute players and the crowd in noisy confusion, + 24 Jesus began to say: “Leave the place, for the little girl did not die, but she is sleeping.” + At this they began to laugh at him scornfully. + 25 As soon as the crowd had been sent outside, he went in and took hold of her hand, + and the little girl got up. + 26 Of course, the talk about this spread out into all that region. 27 As Jesus was passing along from there, two blind men + followed him, crying out and saying: “Have mercy on us, + Son of David.” 28 After he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus asked them: “Do YOU have faith + that I can do this?” They answered him: “Yes, Lord.” 29 Then he touched their eyes, + saying: “According to YOUR faith let it happen to YOU .” 30 And their eyes received sight. Moreover, Jesus sternly charged them, saying: “See that nobody gets to know it.” + 31 But they, after getting outside, made it public about him in all that region. + 32 Now when they were leaving, look! people brought him a dumb man possessed of a demon; + 33 and after the demon had been expelled the dumb man spoke. + Well, the crowds felt amazement + and said: “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.” 34 But the Pharisees began to say: “It is by the ruler of the demons that he expels the demons.” + 35 And Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching * the good news of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity. + 36 On seeing the crowds he felt pity + for them, because they were skinned * and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd. + 37 Then he said to his disciples: “Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. + 38 Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “The sons of the bridechamber,” that is, wedding guests. ^ Or, “border; tassel.” ^ Or, “saved.” ^ Or, “has saved you.” ^ Or, “heralding.” Gr., ke·rysʹson; Lat., praeʹdi·cans . ^ Or, “harassed; annoyed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
