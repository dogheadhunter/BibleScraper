For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah * your God you must worship, + and it is to him alone + you must render sacred service.’” * + 11 Then the Devil left him, + and, look! angels came and began to minister to him. + 12 Now when he heard that John had been arrested, + he withdrew into Galʹi·lee. + 13 Further, after leaving Nazʹa·reth, he came and took up residence in Ca·perʹna·um + beside the sea in the districts of Zebʹu·lun and Naphʹta·li, + 14 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: 15 “O land of Zebʹu·lun and land of Naphʹta·li, along the road of the sea, on the other side of the Jordan, Galʹi·lee + of the nations! 16 the people sitting in darkness + saw a great light, + and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light + rose + upon them.” 17 From that time on Jesus commenced preaching and saying: “Repent, + YOU people, for the kingdom + of the heavens has drawn near.” 18 Walking alongside the sea of Galʹi·lee he saw two brothers, Simon + who is called Peter + and Andrew his brother, letting down a fishing net into the sea, for they were fishers. 19 And he said to them: “Come after me, and I will make YOU fishers of men.” + 20 At once abandoning the nets, + they followed him. 21 Going on also from there he saw two others + [who were] brothers, James [the son] of Zebʹe·dee + and John his brother, in the boat with Zebʹe·dee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. 22 At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him. 23 Then he went around + throughout the whole of Galʹi·lee, + teaching in their synagogues + and preaching the good news * of the kingdom and curing every sort of disease + and every sort of infirmity among the people. 24 And the report about him went out into all Syria; + and they brought him all those faring badly, + distressed with various diseases and torments, demon-possessed and epileptic + and paralyzed persons, and he cured them. 25 Consequently great crowds followed him from Galʹi·lee + and De·capʹo·lis * and Jerusalem + and Ju·deʹa and from the other side of the Jordan.
