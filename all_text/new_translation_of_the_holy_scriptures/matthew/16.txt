But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” + 12 Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of the loaves, but for the teaching + of the Pharisees and Sadducees. 13 Now when he had come into the parts of Caes·a·reʹa Phi·lipʹpi, Jesus went asking his disciples: “Who are men saying the Son of man is?” + 14 They said: “Some say John the Baptist, + others E·liʹjah, + still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” 15 He said to them: “Y OU , though, who do YOU say I am?” + 16 In answer Simon Peter said: “You are the Christ, + the Son of the living God.” + 17 In response Jesus said to him: “Happy you are, Simon son of Joʹnah, * because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to you, but my Father who is in the heavens did. + 18 Also, I say to you, You are Peter, + and on this rock-mass * + I will build my congregation, * and the gates of Haʹdes * + will not overpower it. + 19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will be the thing bound * in the heavens, and whatever you may loose on earth will be the thing loosed * in the heavens.” + 20 Then he sternly charged the disciples not to say to anybody that he was the Christ. + 21 From that time forward Jesus Christ commenced showing his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the older men and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up. + 22 At this Peter took him aside and commenced rebuking him, saying: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this [destiny] at all.” + 23 But, turning his back, * he said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! + You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, + but those of men.” * 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake * and continually + follow me. 25 For whoever wants to save his soul * will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it. + 26 For what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? + or what will a man give in exchange + for his soul? 27 For the Son of man is destined to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will recompense each one according to his behavior. + 28 Truly I say to YOU that there are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” + Footnotes ^ According to CDWItVg; א BSy c,s Arm omit the words in double brackets. ^ “Adulterous.” Gr., moi·kha·lisʹ; Lat., a·dulʹte·ra . ^ Lit., “Bar-jonah,” meaning “Son of Jonah.” Gr., Ba·ri·o·naʹ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), Bar-Yoh·nahʹ .
