Which, in fact, is greater, the gold or the temple that has sanctified the gold? + 18 Also, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is under obligation.’ 19 Blind ones! Which, in fact, is greater, the gift or the altar + that sanctifies the gift? 20 Therefore he that swears by the altar is swearing by it and by all the things on it; 21 and he that swears by the temple is swearing by it and by him that is inhabiting it; + 22 and he that swears by heaven is swearing by the throne of God + and by him that is sitting on it. 23 “Woe to YOU , scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU give the tenth + of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but YOU have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice + and mercy + and faithfulness. * + These things it was binding to do, yet not to disregard the other things. 24 Blind guides, + who strain out the gnat + but gulp down the camel! + 25 “Woe to YOU , scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU cleanse the outside of the cup + and of the dish, but inside they are full of plunder + and immoderateness. 26 Blind + Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup + and of the dish, that the outside of it also may become clean. 27 “Woe to YOU , scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! + because YOU resemble whitewashed + graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every sort of uncleanness. 28 In that way YOU also, outwardly indeed, appear righteous to men, + but inside YOU are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. 29 “Woe to YOU , scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! + because YOU build the graves of the prophets and decorate the memorial tombs of the righteous ones, + 30 and YOU say, ‘If we were in the days of our forefathers, we would not be sharers with them in the blood of the prophets.’ + 31 Therefore YOU are bearing witness against yourselves that YOU are sons of those who murdered the prophets. + 32 Well, then, fill up the measure + of YOUR forefathers. * 33 “Serpents, offspring of vipers, + how are YOU to flee from the judgment of Ge·henʹna? * + 34 For this reason, here I am sending + forth to YOU prophets and wise men and public instructors. * + Some of them YOU will kill + and impale, * and some of them YOU will scourge + in YOUR synagogues and persecute from city to city; 35 that there may come upon YOU all the righteous blood spilled on earth, + from the blood of righteous + Abel + to the blood of Zech·a·riʹah son of Bar·a·chiʹah, whom YOU murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. + 36 Truly I say to YOU , All these things will come upon this generation. + 37 “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets + and stoner + of those sent forth to her, + —how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings! + But YOU people did not want it. + 38 Look! Y OUR house + is abandoned to YOU . + 39 For I say to YOU , Y OU will by no means see me from henceforth until YOU say, ‘Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s * name!’” + Footnotes ^ Or, “broaden their phylacteries.” ^ Or, “borders; tassels.” ^ Or, “places of assembly.” ^ Or, “My Great ( Excellent ) One .” Gr., Rhab·beiʹ ; Lat., rabʹbi ; J 17 (Heb.), Rab· biʹ Rab· biʹ . ^ “Leader.” Gr., ka·the·ge·tesʹ; Lat., ma·giʹster . ^ Or, “servant.” Gr., di·aʹko·nos; Lat., mi·niʹster; J 17,​18 (Heb.), li m·sha·rethʹ , “as an attendant .” ^ א BDVgSy s Arm omit; Vg c Sy c , “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you devour widows’ houses and for a pretense offer long prayers; on this account you will receive judgment more abundantly.” ^ Or, “convert.” Gr., pro·seʹly·ton; Lat., pro·seʹly·tum . ^ “A subject for.” Lit., “a son of.” ^ See App 4C . ^ Or, “divine habitation (dwelling).” Gr., na·oiʹ, dative, sing.; Lat., temʹplum; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ba· heh·khalʹ , “by the palace .” Compare 1Sa 1:9 ftn, “Temple.” ^ Or, “faith.” ^ Or, “measure up fully to your forefathers.” B * , “you will fill up the measure of your forefathers.” ^ See App 4C . ^ Or, “learned persons; scribes.” ^ Or, “fasten on a stake (pole).” See App 5C . ^ See App 1D .
