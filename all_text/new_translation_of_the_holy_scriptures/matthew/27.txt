You must see to that!” + 5 So he threw the silver pieces into the temple * and withdrew, and went off and hanged himself. + 6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said: “It is not lawful to drop them into the sacred treasury, because they are the price of blood.” 7 After consulting together, they bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers. 8 Therefore that field has been called “Field of Blood” + to this very day. 9 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah * the prophet was fulfilled, saying: “And they took * the thirty silver pieces, + the price upon the man that was priced, the one on whom some of the sons of Israel set a price, 10 and they gave * them for the potter’s + field, according to what Jehovah * had commanded me.” 11 Jesus now stood before the governor; and the governor put the question to him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” + Jesus replied: “You yourself say [it].” + 12 But, while he was being accused + by the chief priests and older men, he made no answer. + 13 Then Pilate said to him: “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?” + 14 Yet he did not answer him, no, not a word, so that the governor wondered very much. + 15 Now from festival to festival it was the custom of the governor to release a prisoner to the crowd, the one they wanted. + 16 Just at that time they were holding a notorious prisoner called Bar·abʹbas. + 17 Hence when they were gathered together Pilate said to them: “Which one do YOU want me to release to YOU , Bar·abʹbas or Jesus the so-called Christ?” + 18 For he was aware that out of envy + they had handed him over. + 19 Moreover, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent out to him, saying: “Have nothing to do with that righteous + man, * for I suffered a lot today in a dream + because of him.” 20 But the chief priests and the older men persuaded the crowds to ask for Bar·abʹbas, + but to have Jesus destroyed. 21 Now in responding the governor said to them: “Which of the two do YOU want me to release to YOU ?” They said: “Bar·abʹbas.” + 22 Pilate said to them: “What, then, shall I do with Jesus the so-called Christ?” They all said: “Let him be impaled!” * + 23 He said: “Why, what bad thing did he do?” Still they kept crying out all the more: “Let him be impaled!” + 24 Seeing that it did no good but, rather, an uproar was arising, Pilate took water + and washed his hands before the crowd, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this [man]. * Y OU yourselves must see to it.” 25 At that all the people said in answer: “His blood come upon us and upon our children.” + 26 Then he released Bar·abʹbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped + and handed him over to be impaled. + 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s palace and gathered the whole body of troops together to him. + 28 And disrobing him, they draped him with a scarlet cloak, + 29 and they braided a crown out of thorns and put it on his head and a reed in his right hand. And, kneeling before him, they made fun + of him, saying: “Good day, you King of the Jews!” + 30 And they spit + upon him and took the reed and began hitting him upon his head. 31 Finally, when they had made fun + of him, they took the cloak off and put his outer garments upon him and led him off for impaling. + 32 As they were going out they found a native of Cy·reʹne named Simon. + This man they impressed into service to lift up his torture stake. 33 And when they came to a place called Golʹgo·tha, * + that is to say, Skull Place, * 34 they gave him wine mixed with gall + to drink; but, after tasting it, he refused to drink. + 35 When they had impaled + him they distributed his outer garments + by casting lots, + 36 and, as they sat, they watched over him there. 37 Also, they posted above his head the charge against him, in writing: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.” + 38 Then two robbers were impaled with him, one on his right and one on his left. + 39 So the passersby began speaking abusively + of him, wagging + their heads 40 and saying: “O you would-be thrower-down of the temple + and builder of it in three days, save yourself! If you are a son of God, come down off the torture stake!” + 41 In like manner also the chief priests with the scribes and older men began making fun of him and saying: + 42 “Others he saved; himself he cannot save! He is King + of Israel; let him now come down off the torture stake and we will believe on him. + 43 He has put his trust in God; let Him now rescue + him if He wants him, for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’” + 44 In the same way even the robbers that were impaled together with him began reproaching him. + 45 From the sixth hour * on a darkness fell + over all the land, until the ninth hour. * + 46 About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: “Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?” * that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” + 47 At hearing this, some of those standing there began to say: “This man is calling E·liʹjah.” + 48 And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and soaked it with sour + wine and put it on a reed and went giving him a drink. + 49 But the rest of them said: “Let him be! Let us see whether E·liʹjah comes to save him.” + [[Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out.]] * + 50 Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up [his] spirit. * + 51 And, look! the curtain + of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom, + and the earth quaked, and the rock-masses were split. + 52 And the memorial tombs were opened and many bodies of the holy ones that had fallen asleep were raised up, 53 (and persons, * coming out from among the memorial tombs after his being raised up, entered into the holy city,) + and they became visible to many people. 54 But the army officer * and those with him watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things happening, grew very much afraid, saying: “Certainly this was God’s Son.” * + 55 Moreover, many women were there viewing from a distance, + who had accompanied Jesus from Galʹi·lee to minister to him; + 56 among whom was Mary Magʹda·lene, also Mary the mother of James and Joʹses, * and the mother of the sons of Zebʹe·dee. + 57 Now as it was late in the afternoon, there came a rich man of Ar·i·ma·theʹa, named Joseph, who had also himself become a disciple of Jesus. + 58 This man went up to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. + Then Pilate commanded it to be given over. + 59 And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen, + 60 and laid it in his new memorial tomb, + which he had quarried in the rock-mass. And, after rolling a big stone to the door of the memorial tomb, he left. + 61 But Mary Magʹda·lene and the other Mary continued there, sitting before the grave. + 62 The next day, which was after the Preparation, + the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate, 63 saying: “Sir, we have called to mind that that impostor said while yet alive, ‘After three days + I am to be raised up.’ 64 Therefore command the grave to be made secure until the third day, that his disciples may never come and steal + him and say to the people, ‘He was raised up from the dead!’ and this last imposture will be worse than the first.” 65 Pilate said to them: “Y OU have a guard. + Go make it as secure as YOU know how.” 66 So they went and made the grave secure by sealing the stone + and having the guard.
