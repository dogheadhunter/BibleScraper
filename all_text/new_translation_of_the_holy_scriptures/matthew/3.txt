Someone is crying out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare + the way of Jehovah, * YOU people! Make his roads straight.’” 4 But this very John had his clothing of camel’s hair + and a leather girdle * + around his loins; his food too was insect locusts + and wild honey. + 5 Then Jerusalem * and all Ju·deʹa and all the country around the Jordan made their way out to him, 6 and people were baptized by him in the Jordan River, + openly confessing their sins. 7 When he caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees + coming to the baptism, he said to them: “Y OU offspring of vipers, + who has intimated to YOU to flee from the coming wrath? + 8 So then produce fruit that befits repentance; * + 9 and do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘As a father we have Abraham.’ + For I say to YOU that God is able to raise up children to Abraham + from these stones. 10 Already the ax + is lying at the root of the trees; every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down + and thrown into the fire. + 11 I, for my part, baptize * YOU with water + because of YOUR repentance; + but the one coming + after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not fit to take off. + That one will baptize YOU people with holy spirit * + and with fire. + 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will completely clean up his threshing floor, and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, + but the chaff he will burn + up with fire that cannot be put out.” 13 Then Jesus came from Galʹi·lee + to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized + by him. 14 But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?” 15 In reply Jesus said to him: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” + Then he quit preventing him. 16 After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, + and he saw descending like a dove + God’s spirit coming upon him. + 17 Look! Also, there was a voice + from the heavens that said: “This is my Son, + the beloved, + whom I have approved.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “heralding.” Gr., ke·rysʹson; Lat., praeʹdi·cans . ^ “John.” Gr., I·o·aʹnes; J 1-14,​16-18,​22 (Heb.), Yoh·cha·nanʹ, “Johanan,” meaning “Jehovah Has Shown Favor; Jehovah Has Been Gracious.” ^ Or, “the Immerser; the Dipper.” Gr., ho Ba·pti·stesʹ; J 17,​22 (Heb.), ham·Mat·bilʹ . ^ “Kingdom of the heavens.” Gr., ba·si·leiʹa ton ou·ra·nonʹ; Lat., reʹgnum cae·loʹrum; J 22 (Heb.), mal·khuthʹ sha·maʹyim . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “belt.” ^ Meaning “Possession [or, Foundation] of Twofold Peace.” Gr., I·e·ro·soʹly·ma; J 22 (Heb.), Yeru·sha·laʹyim . ^ Lit., “change of mind.” Gr., me·ta·noiʹas . ^ Or, “immerse; dip.” Gr., ba·ptiʹzo . ^ Or, “active force.” Gr., pneuʹma·ti; Lat., spiʹri·tu; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), be ruʹach , “with active force .” See Ge 1:2 ftn, “Force.” Previous Next Print Share Share
