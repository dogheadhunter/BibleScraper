Come, see the place where he was lying. 7 And go quickly and tell his disciples that he was raised + up from the dead, and, look! he is going ahead of YOU into Galʹi·lee; + there YOU will see him. Look! I have told YOU .” + 8 So, quickly leaving the memorial tomb, with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples. + 9 And, look! Jesus met them and said: “Good day!” They approached and caught him by his feet and did obeisance to him. 10 Then Jesus said to them: “Have no fear! Go, report to my brothers, + that they may go off into Galʹi·lee; and there they will see me.” 11 While they were on their way, look! some of the guard + went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. 12 And after these had gathered together with the older men and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient number of silver pieces to the soldiers + 13 and said: “Say, ‘His disciples + came in the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’ 14 And if this gets to the governor’s ears, we will persuade [him] and will set YOU free from worry.” 15 So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed; and this saying has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day. 16 However, the eleven disciples went into Galʹi·lee + to the mountain where Jesus had arranged for them, 17 and when they saw him they did obeisance, but some doubted. + 18 And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority * + has been given me in heaven and on the earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples * + of people of all the nations, + baptizing + them in * the name of the Father + and of the Son + and of the holy spirit, + 20 teaching + them to observe + all the things I have commanded YOU . + And, look! I am with YOU + all the days until the conclusion * of the system of things.” * + Footnotes ^ “After,” J 17,​18,​21,​22 .
