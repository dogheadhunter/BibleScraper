Your disciples are doing what it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.” + 3 He said to them: “Have YOU not read what David did when he and the men with him got hungry? + 4 How he entered into the house of God and they ate the loaves of presentation, * + something that it was not lawful + for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only? + 5 Or, have YOU not read in the Law + that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple treat the sabbath as not sacred and continue guiltless? + 6 But I tell YOU that something greater than the temple + is here. 7 However, if YOU had understood what this means, * ‘I want mercy, + and not sacrifice,’ + YOU would not have condemned the guiltless ones. 8 For Lord of the sabbath + is what the Son of man is.” + 9 After departing from that place he went into their synagogue; 10 and, look! a man with a withered hand! + So they asked him, “Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath?” that they might get an accusation against him. + 11 He said to them: “Who will be the man among YOU that has one sheep and, if this falls into a pit + on the sabbath, will not get hold of it and lift it out? + 12 All considered, of how much more worth is a man than a sheep! + So it is lawful to do a fine thing on the sabbath.” 13 Then he said to the man: “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored sound like the other hand. + 14 But the Pharisees went out and took counsel against him that they might destroy him. + 15 Having come to know [this], Jesus withdrew from there. Many also followed him, and he cured them all, + 16 but he strictly charged them not to make him manifest; + 17 that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, who said: 18 “Look! My servant + whom I chose, my beloved, + whom my soul approved! I will put my spirit upon him, + and what justice is he will make clear to the nations. 19 He will not wrangle, + nor cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the broad ways. 20 No bruised reed will he crush, and no smoldering flaxen wick will he extinguish, + until he sends out justice + with success. * 21 Indeed, in his name nations will hope.” + 22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man, blind and dumb; and he cured him, so that the dumb man spoke and saw. 23 Well, all the crowds were simply carried away and began to say: + “May this not perhaps be the Son of David?” + 24 At hearing this, the Pharisees said: “This fellow does not expel the demons except by means of Be·elʹze·bub, * the ruler of the demons.” + 25 Knowing their thoughts, + he said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, + and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. 26 In the same way, if Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself; how, then, will his kingdom stand? 27 Moreover, if I expel the demons by means of Be·elʹze·bub, + by means of whom do YOUR sons expel them? This is why they will be judges of YOU . 28 But if it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken YOU . + 29 Or how can anyone invade the house of a strong man and seize his movable goods, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. + 30 He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters. + 31 “On this account I say to YOU , Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. + 32 For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; + but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, * it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things * nor in that to come. + 33 “Either YOU people make the tree fine and its fruit fine or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for by its fruit the tree is known. + 34 Offspring of vipers, + how can YOU speak good things, when YOU are wicked? + For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. + 35 The good man out of his good treasure sends out good things, + whereas the wicked man out of his wicked treasure sends out wicked things. + 36 I tell YOU that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account + concerning it on Judgment Day; 37 for by your words you will be declared righteous, and by your words you will be condemned.” + 38 Then as an answer to him some of the scribes and Pharisees said: “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.” + 39 In reply he said to them: “A wicked and adulterous + generation keeps on seeking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Joʹnah the prophet. + 40 For just as Joʹnah + was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man + will be in the heart of the earth + three days and three nights. + 41 Men of Ninʹe·veh will rise up in the judgment with this generation + and will condemn + it; because they repented at what Joʹnah + preached, * but, look! something more than Joʹnah is here. 42 The queen of the south + will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends * of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solʹo·mon, but, look! something more than Solʹo·mon is here. + 43 “When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through parched places in search of a resting-place, and finds none. + 44 Then it says, ‘I will go back to my house out of which I moved’; and on arriving it finds it unoccupied but swept clean and adorned. 45 Then it goes its way and takes along with it seven different spirits more wicked than itself, + and, after getting inside, they dwell there; and the final circumstances of that man become worse than the first. + That is how it will be also with this wicked generation.” + 46 While he was yet speaking to the crowds, look! his mother and brothers + took up a position outside seeking to speak to him. 47 So someone said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak to you.” * 48 As an answer he said to the one telling him: “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” + 49 And extending his hand toward his disciples, he said: “Look! My mother and my brothers! + 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.” Footnotes ^ Or, “showbread.” Lit., “ loaves of the presentation .” Gr., arʹtous tes pro·theʹse·os ; J 22 (Heb.), leʹchem hap· pa·nimʹ .
