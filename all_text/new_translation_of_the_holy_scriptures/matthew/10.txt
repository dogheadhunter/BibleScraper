Y OU received free, give free. + 9 Do not procure gold or silver or copper for YOUR girdle purses, + 10 or a food pouch for the trip, or two undergarments, * or sandals or a staff; for the worker deserves his food. + 11 “Into whatever city or village YOU enter, search out who in it is deserving, and stay there until YOU leave. + 12 When YOU are entering into the house, greet the household; 13 and if the house is deserving, let the peace YOU wish it come upon it; + but if it is not deserving, let the peace from YOU return upon YOU . 14 Wherever anyone does not take YOU in or listen to YOUR words, on going out of that house or that city shake the dust off YOUR feet. + 15 Truly I say to YOU , It will be more endurable for the land of Sodʹom + and Go·morʹrah on Judgment Day than for that city. + 16 “Look! I am sending YOU forth as sheep amidst wolves; + therefore prove yourselves cautious as serpents + and yet innocent as doves. + 17 Be on YOUR guard against men; + for they will deliver YOU up to local courts, * + and they will scourge + YOU in their synagogues. + 18 Why, YOU will be haled before governors and kings + for my sake, for a witness * + to them and the nations. 19 However, when they deliver YOU up, do not become anxious about how or what YOU are to speak; for what YOU are to speak will be given YOU in that hour; + 20 for the ones speaking are not just YOU , but it is the spirit of YOUR Father that speaks by YOU . + 21 Further, brother + will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child, and children will rise up against parents and will have them put to death. + 22 And YOU will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name; + but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved. + 23 When they persecute YOU in one city, flee to another; + for truly I say to YOU , Y OU will by no means complete the circuit + of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives. + 24 “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his lord. + 25 It is enough for the disciple to become as his teacher, and the slave as his lord. + If people have called the householder Be·elʹze·bub, * + how much more [will they call] those of his household so? 26 Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known. + 27 What I tell YOU in the darkness, say in the light; * and what YOU hear whispered, * preach from the housetops. + 28 And do not become fearful + of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; * but rather be in fear of him + that can destroy both soul and body in Ge·henʹna. * + 29 Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value? * + Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without YOUR Father’s [knowledge]. + 30 But the very hairs of YOUR head are all numbered. + 31 Therefore have no fear: YOU are worth more than many sparrows. + 32 “Everyone, then, that confesses union with me before men, I will also confess union + with him before my Father who is in the heavens; 33 but whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown + him before my Father who is in the heavens. 34 Do not think I came to put peace upon the earth; I came to put, not peace, + but a sword. 35 For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law. + 36 Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household. 37 He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me. + 38 And whoever does not accept his torture stake * and follow after me is not worthy of me. + 39 He that finds his soul * will lose it, and he that loses his soul for my sake will find it. + 40 “He that receives YOU receives me also, and he that receives me receives him also that sent me forth. + 41 He that receives a prophet because he is a prophet will get a prophet’s reward, + and he that receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will get a righteous man’s reward. + 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink because he is a disciple, I tell YOU truly, he will by no means lose his reward.” + Footnotes ^ “Peter” is named five different ways: here as “Simon, the one called Peter”; in 16:16 , “Simon Peter”; in Ac 15:14 , “Symeon”; in Joh 1:42 , “Cephas”; and most frequently “Peter,” as in Mt 14:28 . ^ Meaning “Son of Tolmai.” At times he was called Nathanael, presumably his surname.
