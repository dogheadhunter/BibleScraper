Truly I say to YOU , By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.” + 3 While he was sitting upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: “Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence * + and of the conclusion * of the system of things?” * + 4 And in answer Jesus said to them: “Look out that nobody misleads YOU ; + 5 for many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ * and will mislead many. + 6 Y OU are going to hear of wars and reports of wars; see that YOU are not terrified. For these things must take place, but the end * is not yet. + 7 “For nation will rise * against nation + and kingdom against kingdom, + and there will be food shortages + and earthquakes + in one place after another. 8 All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. 9 “Then people will deliver YOU up to tribulation + and will kill + YOU , and YOU will be objects of hatred + by all the nations on account of my name. + 10 Then, also, many will be stumbled + and will betray one another and will hate one another. + 11 And many false prophets + will arise and mislead many; + 12 and because of the increasing of lawlessness + the love of the greater number will cool off. + 13 But he that has endured + to the end * is the one that will be saved. + 14 And this good news + of the kingdom + will be preached * in all the inhabited earth * for a witness * to all the nations; + and then the end * + will come. 15 “Therefore, when YOU catch sight of the disgusting thing + that causes desolation, as spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place, * + (let the reader use discernment,) * 16 then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing + to the mountains. 17 Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house; 18 and let the man in the field not return to the house to pick up his outer garment. 19 Woe to the pregnant women and those suckling a baby in those days! + 20 Keep praying that YOUR flight may not occur in wintertime, nor on the sabbath day; * 21 for then there will be great tribulation * + such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, + no, nor will occur again. 22 In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones + those days will be cut short. + 23 “Then if anyone says to YOU , ‘Look! Here is the Christ,’ + or, ‘There!’ do not believe it. + 24 For false Christs + and false prophets + will arise and will give great signs + and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones. + 25 Look! I have forewarned YOU . + 26 Therefore, if people say to YOU , ‘Look! He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look! He is in the inner chambers,’ do not believe it. + 27 For just as the lightning + comes out of eastern parts and shines over to western parts, so the presence * of the Son of man will be. + 28 Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles + will be gathered together. + 29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, + and the moon + will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. + 30 And then the sign of the Son of man + will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, + and they will see the Son of man coming * on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. * + 31 And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet sound, + and they will gather his chosen ones + together from the four winds, + from one extremity of the heavens to their other extremity. 32 “Now learn from the fig tree as an illustration this point: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and it puts forth leaves, YOU know that summer is near. + 33 Likewise also YOU , when YOU see all these things, know that he is near at the doors. + 34 Truly I say to YOU that this generation * + will by no means pass away until all these things occur. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, + but my words will by no means pass away. + 36 “Concerning that day and hour + nobody knows, neither the angels of the heavens nor the Son, * but only the Father. + 37 For just as the days of Noah + were, so the presence * of the Son of man will be. + 38 For as they were in those days before the flood, * eating and drinking, men marrying and women being given in marriage, until the day that Noah + entered into the ark; + 39 and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, + so the presence * of the Son of man will be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken along and the other be abandoned; 41 two women will be grinding at the hand mill: + one will be taken along and the other be abandoned. + 42 Keep on the watch, therefore, because YOU do not know on what day YOUR Lord is coming. + 43 “But know one thing, that if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming, + he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44 On this account YOU too prove yourselves ready, + because at an hour that YOU do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming. 45 “Who really is the faithful and discreet slave + whom his master appointed over his domestics, to give them their food at the proper time? + 46 Happy + is that slave if his master on arriving * finds him doing so. 47 Truly I say to YOU , He will appoint him over all his belongings. + 48 “But if ever that evil slave should say in his heart, + ‘My master is delaying,’ + 49 and should start to beat his fellow slaves and should eat and drink with the confirmed drunkards, 50 the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and in an hour + that he does not know, 51 and will punish him with the greatest severity * + and will assign him his part with the hypocrites. There is where [his] * weeping and the gnashing * of [his] * teeth will be. + Footnotes ^ Gr., pa·rou·siʹas .
