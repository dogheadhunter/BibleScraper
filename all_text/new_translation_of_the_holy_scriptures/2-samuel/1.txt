Tell me, please.” To this he said: “The people have fled from the battle and also many of the people have fallen so that they died, + and even Saul + and Jonʹa·than + his son have died.” 5 Then David said to the young man that was telling him: “How do you really know that Saul has died and also Jonʹa·than his son?” + 6 At this the young man that was telling him said: “I unexpectedly chanced to be on Mount Gil·boʹa, + and there was Saul supporting himself upon his spear; + and, look! the charioteers * and the mounted men had caught up with him. + 7 When he turned back and saw me, then he called me, and I said, ‘Here I am!’ 8 And he went on to say to me, ‘Who are you?’ at which I said to him, ‘I am an A·malʹek·ite.’ + 9 Then he said, ‘Stand, please, over me and definitely put me to death, for the cramp * has seized me, because all my soul + is yet in me.’ 10 So I stood over him and definitely put him to death, + for I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. Then I took the diadem + that was upon his head and the bracelet that was upon his arm, that I might bring them to my lord here.” 11 At this David took hold of his garments and ripped them apart, + and so did all the men also that were with him. 12 And they began to wail and weep + and fast + until the evening over Saul and over Jonʹa·than his son and over the people of Jehovah * and over the house of Israel, + because they had fallen by the sword. 13 David now said to the young man that was telling him: “Where are you from?” to which he said: “I am the son of an alien resident, an A·malʹek·ite.” + 14 Then David said to him: “How was it that you did not fear + to thrust your hand out to bring the anointed * + of Jehovah to ruin?” 15 With that David called one of the young men and said: “Go near. Smite him.” Accordingly he struck him down so that he died. + 16 David then said to him: “The bloodguilt for you * be upon your own head, + because your own mouth has testified against you, + saying, ‘I myself definitely put the anointed of Jehovah to death.’” + 17 And David proceeded to chant this dirge + over Saul and Jonʹa·than his son + 18 and to say that the sons of Judah + should be taught “The Bow.” + Look! It is written in the book of Jaʹshar: * + 19 “The beauty, O Israel, is slain upon your high places. + How have the mighty men fallen! 20 Do not, YOU people, tell it in Gath; + Do not announce it in the streets of Ashʹke·lon, + For fear that the daughters of the Phi·lisʹtines may rejoice, For fear that the daughters of the uncircumcised men may exult. + 21 Y OU mountains of Gil·boʹa, + let no dew, let no rain be upon YOU , nor let there be fields of holy contributions; * + Because there the shield of mighty ones was befouled, * The shield of Saul, so that there was none anointed with oil. + 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of mighty ones, The bow of Jonʹa·than did not turn back, + And the sword of Saul would not return without success. + 23 Saul and Jonʹa·than, + the lovable ones and the pleasant ones during their life, And in their death they were not separated. + Swifter than the eagles they were, + Mightier than the lions * they were. + 24 Y OU daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed YOU in scarlet with finery, Who put ornaments of gold upon YOUR clothing. + 25 How have the mighty ones fallen in the midst of the battle! + Jonʹa·than slain upon your high places! + 26 I am distressed over you, my brother Jonʹa·than, Very pleasant you were to me. + More wonderful was your love to me than the love from women. + 27 How have the mighty ones fallen + And the weapons of war perished!” Footnotes ^ “The Amalekites,” Sy and five Heb. mss; MLXXVg, “Amalek.” ^ Or, “chariots.” ^ “Giddiness,” Sy; meaning is uncertain in M. ^ “Jehovah,” MSyVg; LXX, “Judah.” ^ “ Anointed of.” Heb., meshiʹach ; Gr., khri·stonʹ ; Syr., la m·shi·ch eh; Lat., chriʹstum . ^ Lit., “Your bloods.” ^ Or, “the Upright One.” ^ “Fields of firstfruits,” LXXVg. ^ Or, “rejected with loathing.” ^ “Than the lions .” Heb., me· ʼara·yohthʹ , African lions.
