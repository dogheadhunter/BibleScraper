But as for my lord the king, why has he found delight in this thing?” + 4 Finally the king’s word prevailed + upon Joʹab and the chiefs of the military forces. So Joʹab and the chiefs of the military forces went out from before the king to register + the people Israel. 5 Then they crossed the Jordan and took up camping at A·roʹer + to the right of the city * that is in the middle of the torrent valley, toward the Gadʹites, + and to Jaʹzer. + 6 After that they came on to Gilʹe·ad + and the land of Tahʹtim-hodʹshi * and continued on to Dan-jaʹan and went around to Siʹdon. + 7 Then they came to the fortress of Tyre + and all the cities of the Hiʹvites + and of the Caʹnaan·ites and came to the terminating point in the Negʹeb + of Judah at Beʹer-sheʹba. + 8 Thus they went moving about through all the land and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 9 Joʹab now gave the number of the registration + of the people to the king; and Israel amounted to eight hundred thousand valiant men drawing sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. + 10 And David’s heart began to beat + him after he had so numbered the people. Consequently David said to Jehovah: “I have sinned + very much in what I have done. And now, Jehovah, let your servant’s error pass by, + please; for I have acted very foolishly.” + 11 When David proceeded to rise up in the morning, Jehovah’s word itself came to Gad + the prophet, David’s visionary, + saying: 12 “Go, * and you must say to David, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “Three things I am laying upon you. + Choose for yourself one of them that I may do it to you.”’” + 13 Accordingly Gad came in to David and told him and said to him: + “Should there come to you seven * years of famine in your land, + or three months of your fleeing before your adversaries, + with them pursuing you, or the occurring of three days of pestilence * in your land? + Now know and see what I shall reply to the One sending me.” 14 So David said to Gad: “It is very distressing to me. Let us fall, please, into the hand of Jehovah, + for many are his mercies; + but into the hand of man * do not let me fall.” * + 15 Then Jehovah gave a pestilence + in Israel from the morning until the time appointed, so that out of the people from Dan to Beʹer-sheʹba + seventy thousand persons died. + 16 And the angel + kept his hand thrust out toward Jerusalem to bring it to ruin; and Jehovah began to feel regret + over the calamity, and so he said to the angel that was bringing ruin among the people: “It is enough! Now let your hand drop.” And Jehovah’s angel himself happened to be close by the threshing floor of A·rauʹnah + the Jebʹu·site. + 17 And David proceeded to say to Jehovah, when he saw the angel that was striking the people down, yes, he proceeded to say: “Here it is I that have sinned and it is I that have done wrong; but these sheep + —what have they done? Let your hand, please, come upon me + and upon the house of my father.” 18 Later Gad came in to David on that day and said to him: “Go up, set up for Jehovah an altar on the threshing floor of A·rauʹnah the Jebʹu·site.” + 19 And David began to go up in accord with the word of Gad, according to what Jehovah had commanded. + 20 When A·rauʹnah looked down and saw the king and his servants passing along toward him, A·rauʹnah at once went out and bowed + down to the king with his face to the earth. + 21 Then A·rauʹnah said: “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” At that David said: “To buy + from you the threshing floor for building an altar to Jehovah, that the scourge + may be halted from upon the people.” 22 But A·rauʹnah said to David: “Let my lord the king take it + and offer up what is good in his eyes. See the cattle for the burnt offering and the threshing sledge and the implements of the cattle for the wood. + 23 Everything A·rauʹnah, O king, * does give to the king.” And A·rauʹnah went on to say to the king: “May Jehovah your God show pleasure in you.” + 24 However, the king said to A·rauʹnah: “No, but without fail I shall buy it from you for a price; + and I shall not offer up to Jehovah my God burnt sacrifices without cost.” + Accordingly David bought + the threshing floor and the cattle for fifty silver shekels. * 25 And David proceeded to build there an altar + to Jehovah and offer up burnt sacrifices and communion sacrifices, and Jehovah began letting himself be entreated + for the land, so that the scourge was halted from upon Israel.
