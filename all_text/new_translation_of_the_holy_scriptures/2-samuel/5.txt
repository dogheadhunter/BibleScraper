We ourselves are your bone and your flesh. + 2 Both yesterday and previously + while Saul happened to be king over us, you yourself became the one leading Israel out and bringing it in. + And Jehovah proceeded to say to you, ‘You yourself will shepherd + my people Israel, and you yourself will become leader + over Israel.’” 3 So all the older men * + of Israel came to the king at Heʹbron, and King David concluded a covenant + with them in Heʹbron before Jehovah; after which they anointed + David as king over Israel. * + 4 Thirty years old was David when he became king. For forty years + he ruled as king. 5 In Heʹbron he ruled as king over Judah for seven years and six months; + and in Jerusalem + he ruled as king for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. 6 Consequently the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebʹu·sites + inhabiting the land, and they began to say to David: “You will not come in here, but the blind and the lame ones will certainly turn you away,” + they thinking: “David will not come in here.” 7 Just the same, David proceeded to capture the stronghold of Zion, + that is, the City of David. + 8 So David said on that day: “Anyone striking the Jebʹu·sites, + let him, by means of the water tunnel, + make contact with both the lame and the blind, hateful to the soul of David!” That is why they say: “The blind one and the lame one will not come into the house.” 9 And David took up dwelling in the stronghold, and it came to be called the City of David; and David began to build all around from the Mound * + and inward. 10 Thus David went on getting greater and greater, + and Jehovah the God of armies * + was with him. + 11 And Hiʹram + the king of Tyre proceeded to send messengers + to David, and also cedar trees + and workers in wood and workers in stone for walls, and they began to build a house for David. + 12 And David came to know that Jehovah had firmly established him as king over Israel + and that he had exalted + his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel. + 13 Meantime, David went on taking more concubines + and wives + out of Jerusalem after he came from Heʹbron; and more sons and daughters continued to be born to David. 14 And these are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Sham·muʹa + and Shoʹbab + and Nathan + and Solʹo·mon, + 15 and Ibʹhar and E·liʹshu·a + and Neʹpheg + and Ja·phiʹa, + 16 and E·lishʹa·ma + and E·liʹa·da and E·liphʹe·let. + 17 And the Phi·lisʹtines got to hear that they had anointed David as king over Israel. + At that all the Phi·lisʹtines came up to look for David. When David heard of it, then he went down to the place hard to approach. + 18 And the Phi·lisʹtines, for their part, came in and kept tramping about in the low plain of Rephʹa·im. + 19 And David began to inquire + of Jehovah, saying: “Shall I go up against the Phi·lisʹtines? Will you give them into my hand?” At this Jehovah said to David: “Go up, for I shall without fail give the Phi·lisʹtines into your hands.” + 20 So David came to Baʹal-pe·raʹzim, + and David got to strike them down there. At that he said: “Jehovah has broken through my enemies + ahead of me, like a gap made by waters.” That is why he called the name of that place Baʹal-pe·raʹzim. * + 21 Consequently they left their idols * + there, and so David and his men took them away. + 22 Later the Phi·lisʹtines came up once again + and tramped about in the low plain of Rephʹa·im. + 23 At that David inquired + of Jehovah, but he said: “You must not go up. Go around to the rear of them, and you must come against them in front of the baʹca bushes. * + 24 And let it occur that, when you hear the sound of a marching * in the tops of the baʹca bushes, at that time you act with decision, + because at that time Jehovah will have gone out ahead of you to strike down the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines.” + 25 Accordingly David did that way, just as Jehovah had commanded him, + and he went striking down + the Phi·lisʹtines from Geʹba * + to as far as Geʹzer. + Footnotes ^ Or, “elders.” ^ “Over Israel,” MSyVg; LXX, “over Israel as a whole.” ^ Lit., “the Millo (filling).” Heb., ham·mil·lohʼʹ .
