And his name was Me·phibʹo·sheth. + 5 And the sons of Rimʹmon the Be·erʹoth·ite, Reʹchab and Baʹa·nah, proceeded to go and come to the house of Ish-boʹsheth + about when the day had heated up, as he was taking his noonday siesta. 6 And here they came into the middle of the house as men fetching wheat, and then struck him in the abdomen; + and Reʹchab and Baʹa·nah + his brother themselves escaped detection. 7 When they went into the house, he was lying upon his couch in his inner bedroom, and then they struck him so that they put him to death, + after which they removed his head + and took his head and walked on the road to the Arʹa·bah all night long. 8 Eventually they came bringing the head of Ish-boʹsheth + to David at Heʹbron and said to the king: “Here is the head of Ish-boʹsheth the son of Saul your enemy + who looked for your soul; + but Jehovah gives to my lord the king revenge + this day upon Saul and his offspring.” 9 However, David answered Reʹchab and Baʹa·nah his brother, the sons of Rimʹmon the Be·erʹoth·ite, and said to them: “As Jehovah who redeemed + my soul + out of all distress + is living, + 10 when there was one reporting to me, + saying, ‘Here Saul is dead,’ and he himself in his own eyes became like a bringer of good news, I, however, took hold of him and killed + him in Zikʹlag when it was due [for me] to give him the messenger’s fee; 11 how much more so when wicked men + themselves have killed a righteous man in his own house upon his bed? And now should I not require his blood from YOUR hands, + and must I not clear YOU out of the earth?” + 12 With that David commanded the young men and they killed them + and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged + them by the pool in Heʹbron; and the head of Ish-boʹsheth they took and then buried in the burial place of Abʹner in Heʹbron. + Footnotes ^ “Belong to Ish-bosheth the son of Saul,” LXX Bagster .
