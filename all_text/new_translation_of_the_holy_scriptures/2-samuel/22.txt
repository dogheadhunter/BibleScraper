* + 33 The [true] God is my strong fortress, * + And he will cause my way to be perfect, + 34 Making * my feet like those of the hinds; + And upon places high for me he keeps me standing. + 35 He is teaching my hands for warfare; + And my arms have pressed down a bow of copper. + 36 And you will give me your shield of salvation, + And it is your humility that makes me great. + 37 You will make room large enough for my steps under me; + And my ankles will certainly not wobble. + 38 I will pursue my enemies, that I may annihilate them, And I shall not return until they are exterminated. + 39 And I shall exterminate them and break them in pieces, + that they may not rise up; + And they will fall under my feet. + 40 And you will gird me with vital energy for the battle; + You will make those rising against me collapse under me. + 41 And as for my enemies, you will certainly give me the back of their neck; + Those hating me intensely—I shall also silence them. + 42 They cry for help, but there is no savior; + To Jehovah, but he actually does not answer them. + 43 And I shall pound them fine like the dust of the earth; Like the mire of the streets I shall pulverize them; + I shall beat them flat. 44 And you will provide me escape from the faultfinding of my people. + You will safeguard me to be the head of nations; + A people that I have not known—they will serve me. + 45 Foreigners themselves will come cringing to me; + Ears will be obedient to hear me. + 46 Foreigners * themselves will fade away, And they will come quaking out from their bulwarks. + 47 Jehovah is living; + and blessed be my Rock; + And let the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted. + 48 The [true] God is the Giver of acts of vengeance to me + And the One bringing the peoples down under me, + 49 And the One bringing me out from my enemies. + And above those who rise up against me you will lift me up; + From the man of violent deeds you will deliver me. + 50 That is why I shall thank you, O Jehovah, among the nations; + And to your name I shall make melody: + 51 The One doing great acts of salvation for his king + And exercising loving-kindness * to his anointed one, * + To David and to his seed * for time indefinite.” + Footnotes ^ “ Sheol .” Heb., sheʼohlʹ ; Syr., da· shiul ; Vg c (Lat.), in·ferʹni ; Gr., tha·naʹtou , “death.” See App 4B . ^ Possibly, “he came darting,” by correcting one Heb. letter, and as in Ps 18:10 and many Heb. mss. ^ Or, “wings of wind.” ^ Lit., “darkness of waters.” ^ “Productive land.” Heb., te·velʹ; Gr., oi·kou·meʹnes, “inhabited earth,” the same word as in Mt 24:14 ; Lat., orʹbis, “[terrestrial] circle.” ^ “Breath of.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma·tos . ^ Lit., “it,” fem. ^ Lit., “but your eyes you will lower against the haughty ones.” ^ “Who is a God,” M(Heb., mi-ʼElʹ )Vg; LXX, “who is a Strong One.” ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu; Gr., The·ouʹ ; Lat., Deʹum . ^ In agreement with Ps 18:32 , this text might be corrected to read: “The [true] God is girding me with vital energy.” ^ Or, “setting.” ^ Lit., “Sons of a foreign (country).” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “To his anointed one .” Heb., li m·shi·ch ohʹ; Gr., khri·stoiʹ ; Syr., la m·shi·ch eh; Lat., chriʹsto . ^ Or, “offspring; posterity.” Previous Next Print Share Share
