Then Jehovah said: “Upon Saul and upon his house there is bloodguilt, * because he put the Gibʹe·on·ites to death.” + 2 So the king called the Gibʹe·on·ites + and talked to them. (Incidentally, the Gibʹe·on·ites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remainder of the Amʹor·ites; + and the sons of Israel themselves had sworn to them, + but Saul sought to strike + them down in his feeling jealous + for the sons of Israel and Judah.) 3 And David went on to say to the Gibʹe·on·ites: “What shall I do to YOU , and with what shall I make atonement, * + that YOU may certainly bless the inheritance + of Jehovah?” 4 So the Gibʹe·on·ites said to him: “It is not a matter of silver or gold + for us * in connection with Saul and his household, neither is it ours to put a man to death in Israel.” At that he said: “Whatever YOU are saying I shall do for YOU .” 5 At this they said to the king: “The man that exterminated + us and that schemed + to annihilate us from subsisting in any of the territory of Israel, 6 let there be given to us seven men of his sons; + and we must expose * + them to Jehovah in Gibʹe·ah + of Saul, the chosen one * of Jehovah.” + Accordingly the king said: “I myself shall give them.” 7 However, the king felt compassion upon Me·phibʹo·sheth + the son of Jonʹa·than the son of Saul on account of the oath + of Jehovah that was between them, between David and Jonʹa·than the son of Saul. 8 Consequently the king took the two sons of Rizʹpah + the daughter of Aʹiah whom she bore to Saul, Ar·moʹni and Me·phibʹo·sheth, and the five sons of Miʹchal * + the daughter of Saul whom she bore to Aʹdri·el + the son of Bar·zilʹlai the Me·holʹath·ite. 9 Then he gave them into the hand of the Gibʹe·on·ites and they proceeded to expose them on the mountain before Jehovah, + so that the seven of them fell together; and they themselves were put to death in the first days of harvest, at the start of the barley harvest. + 10 However, Rizʹpah the daughter of Aʹiah + took sackcloth + and spread it for herself upon the rock from the start of harvest until water poured down upon them from the heavens; + and she did not allow the fowls + of the heavens to rest upon them by day nor the wild beasts + of the field by night. 11 At length it was reported + to David what Rizʹpah the daughter of Aʹiah, Saul’s concubine, had done. 12 So David went and took the bones of Saul + and the bones of Jonʹa·than his son from the landowners of Jaʹbesh-gilʹe·ad, + who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan, + where the Phi·lisʹtines had hanged + them on the day that the Phi·lisʹtines struck down Saul on Gil·boʹa. + 13 And he proceeded to bring up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonʹa·than his son; furthermore, they gathered the bones of the men being exposed. + 14 Then they buried the bones of Saul and of Jonʹa·than his son * in the land of Benjamin in Zeʹla * + in the burial place of Kish + his father, that they might do everything that the king had commanded. So God let himself be entreated for the land after this. + 15 And the Phi·lisʹtines + came to have war again with Israel. Accordingly David and his servants with him went down and fought the Phi·lisʹtines; and David grew tired. 16 And Ishʹbi-beʹnob, who was among those born of the Rephʹa·im, * + the weight of whose spear + was three hundred shekels * of copper and who was girded with a new sword, * got to think of striking David down. 17 At once A·bishʹai + the son of Ze·ruʹiah came to his help + and struck the Phi·lisʹtine down and put him to death. At that time the men of David swore to him, saying: “You must not go out with us to the battle anymore, + that you may not extinguish + the lamp + of Israel!” 18 And it came about after this that war arose once more with the Phi·lisʹtines at Gob. * Then it was that Sibʹbe·cai + the Huʹshath·ite + struck down Saph, who was among those born of the Rephʹa·im. + 19 And war arose once again with the Phi·lisʹtines at Gob, and El·haʹnan + the son of Jaʹa·re-orʹe·gim the Bethʹle·hem·ite got to strike down Go·liʹath * the Gitʹtite, * the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers. + 20 And war arose yet again at Gath, + when there happened to be a man of extraordinary size, with six fingers on each of his hands and six toes on each of his feet, twenty-four in number; and he too had been born to the Rephʹa·im. + 21 And he kept taunting + Israel. Finally Jonʹa·than + the son of Shimʹe·i, * + David’s brother, struck him down. 22 These four had been born to the Rephʹa·im in Gath; + and they came to fall by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the bloods .” Heb., had· da·mimʹ . ^ Or, “amends.” ^ Lit., “me,” M, in a collective sense; M margin , “us.” ^ “Expose,” M, that is, with arms and legs broken; LXX, “hang in the sun”; Sy, “sacrifice”; Vg, “crucify.” ^ “The chosen one,” M; LXX, “the ones chosen”; Vg, “the one once chosen.” Probably to be read, “on the mountain.” Compare vs 9. ^ “Merab,” LXX L Sy and two Heb. mss.
