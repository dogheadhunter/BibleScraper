And what is my house that you have brought me thus far? 19 As though this should even be something little in your eyes, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, yet you also speak respecting the house of your servant down to a distant future time; and this is the law given for mankind, * + O Sovereign Lord Jehovah. + 20 And what more can David add and speak to you, when you yourself know your servant well, + O Sovereign Lord Jehovah? 21 For the sake of your word + and in agreement with your own heart + you have done all these great things to cause your servant to know them. + 22 That is why you are indeed great, + O Sovereign Lord Jehovah; for there is no other like you, + and there is no God except you + among all of whom we have heard with our ears. 23 And what one * nation in the earth is like your people Israel, + whom God went to redeem to himself as a people + and to assign himself a name + and to do for them * great and fear-inspiring things + —to drive out * because of your people, whom you have redeemed + to yourself from Egypt, the nations and their gods? 24 And you proceeded to establish your people Israel + firmly for yourself as your people to time indefinite; and you yourself, O Jehovah, have become their God. + 25 “And now, Jehovah God, * the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house carry out to time indefinite and do just as you have spoken. + 26 And let your own name become great to time indefinite, + saying, ‘Jehovah of armies is God over Israel,’ + and let the very house of your servant David become firmly established before you. + 27 For you, Jehovah of armies the God of Israel, have made a revelation to your servant’s ear, saying, ‘A house I shall build for you.’ + That is why your servant has taken heart * to pray to you with this prayer. + 28 And now, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, you are the [true] God; and as for your words, let them prove to be truth, * + since you promise to your servant this goodness. + 29 And now take it upon yourself and bless + the house of your servant [for it] to continue to time indefinite before you; + for you yourself, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, have promised, and due to your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed to time indefinite.” + Footnotes ^ “Tribes,” MSyVg; in 1Ch 17:6 , “judges.” ^ Or, “of an earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ; LXXSyVg, “of men.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Mankind.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ; LXX, “the man”; Lat., aʹdam . ^ “For them,” four Heb. mss (compare TSyVg); M, “for you people.” ^ “To drive out,” in agreement with LXX and 1Ch 17:21 ; M, “for your land”; Vg, “upon the land (earth).” ^ “One,” MSy; LXX, “other.” ^ “Jehovah God.” Heb., Yehwahʹ ʼElo·himʹ; the first occurrence since Ex 9:30 . ^ Lit., “has found his heart.” ^ Or, “true.” Heb., ʼemethʹ .
