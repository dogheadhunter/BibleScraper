Jehovah * is bringing up against them + the mighty and the many waters of the River, + the king of As·syrʹi·a + and all his glory. + And he will certainly come up over all his streambeds and go over all his banks 8 and move on through Judah. He will actually flood and pass over. + Up to the neck he will reach. + And the outspreading of his wings + must occur to fill the breadth of your land, O Im·manʹu·el!” * + 9 Be injurious, * O YOU peoples, and be shattered to pieces; and give ear, all YOU in distant parts of the earth! + Gird yourselves, + and be shattered to pieces! + Gird yourselves, and be shattered to pieces! 10 Plan out a scheme, and it will be broken up! + Speak any word, and it will not stand, for God is with us! * + 11 For this is what Jehovah has said to me with strongness of the hand, that he may make me turn aside * from walking in the way of this people, saying: 12 “Y OU men must not say, ‘A conspiracy!’ respecting all that of which this people keep saying, ‘A conspiracy!’ + and the object of their fear YOU men must not fear, nor must YOU tremble at it. + 13 Jehovah of armies—he is the One whom YOU should treat as holy, + and he should be the object of YOUR fear, + and he should be the One causing YOU to tremble.” + 14 And he must become as a sacred place; * + but as a stone to strike against and as a rock over which to stumble + to both the houses of Israel, as a trap and as a snare to the inhabitants * of Jerusalem. + 15 And many among them will be certain to stumble and to fall and be broken, and to be snared and caught. + 16 Wrap up the attestation, * + put a seal about the law among my disciples! * + 17 And I will keep in expectation of Jehovah, + who is concealing his face from the house of Jacob, + and I will hope in him. + 18 Look! I and the children whom Jehovah has given me + are as signs + and as miracles * in Israel from Jehovah of armies, who is residing in Mount Zion. + 19 And in case they should say to YOU people: “Apply to the spiritistic mediums + or to those having a spirit of prediction who are chirping + and making utterances in low tones,” * is it not to its God that any people should apply? + [Should there be application] to dead persons in behalf of living persons? + 20 To * the law and to the attestation! + Surely they will keep saying what is according to this statement * + that will have no light of dawn. + 21 And each one * will certainly pass through the land * hard pressed and hungry; + and it must occur that because he is hungry and has made himself feel indignant, he will actually call down evil upon his king and upon his God * + and will certainly peer upward. 22 And to the earth he will look, and, lo! distress and darkness, + obscurity, hard times and gloominess with no brightness. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “with a common stylus.” ^ Meaning “Hasten, O [or, Hastening to the] Spoil!
