The hand of Jehovah has not become too short that it cannot save, + nor has his ear become too heavy that it cannot hear. + 2 No, but the very errors of YOU people have become the things causing division between YOU and YOUR God, * + and YOUR own sins have caused the concealing of [his] face from YOU to keep from hearing. + 3 For YOUR own palms have become polluted with blood, + and YOUR fingers with error. Y OUR own lips have spoken falsehood. + Y OUR own tongue kept muttering sheer unrighteousness. + 4 There is no one calling out in righteousness, + and no one at all has gone to court in faithfulness. There has been a trusting in unreality, + and a speaking of worthlessness. + There has been a conceiving of trouble, and a bringing of what is hurtful to birth. + 5 The eggs of a poisonous snake are what they have hatched, and they kept weaving the mere cobweb of a spider. + Anyone eating some of their eggs would die, and the [egg] that was smashed would be hatched into a viper. + 6 Their mere cobweb will not serve as a garment, nor will they cover themselves with their works. + Their works are hurtful works, and the activity of violence is in their palms. + 7 Their own feet keep running to sheer badness, + and they are in a hurry to shed innocent blood. + Their thoughts are hurtful thoughts; + despoiling and breakdown are in their highways. * + 8 The way of peace + they have ignored, and there is no justice in their tracks. + Their roadways they have made crooked for themselves. + No one at all treading in them * will actually know peace. + 9 That is why justice has come to be far away from us, and righteousness does not catch up with us. We keep hoping for light, but, look! darkness; for brightness, [but] in continuous gloom we kept walking. + 10 We keep groping for the wall just like blind men, and like those without eyes we keep groping. + We have stumbled at high noon just as in evening darkness; among the stout ones [we are] just like dead people. + 11 We keep groaning, all of us, just like bears; and like doves we mournfully keep cooing. + We kept hoping for justice, + but there was none; for salvation, [but] it has stayed far away from us. + 12 For our revolts have become many in front of you; + and as for our sins, each one has testified against us. + For our revolts are with us; and as for our errors, we well know them. + 13 There have been transgressing and a denying of Jehovah; + and there was a moving back from our God, * a speaking of oppression and revolt, + a conceiving and a muttering of words of falsehood from the very heart. + 14 And justice was forced to move back, + and righteousness itself kept standing simply far off. + For truth has stumbled even in the public square, and what is straightforward is unable to enter. + 15 And the truth proves to be missing, + and anyone turning away from badness is being despoiled. + And Jehovah got to see, and it was bad in his eyes that there was no justice. + 16 And when he saw that there was no man, * he began to show himself astonished that there was no one interposing. + And his arm proceeded to save for him, and his own righteousness was the thing that supported him. + 17 Then he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, + and the helmet of salvation upon his head. + Furthermore, he put on the garments of vengeance as raiment + and enwrapped himself with zeal as if a sleeveless coat. + 18 In accordance with the dealings he will reward correspondingly, + rage to his adversaries, due treatment to his enemies. + To the islands * he will recompense due treatment. + 19 And from the sunset they will begin to fear the name of Jehovah, + and from the rising of the sun the glory of him, + for he will come in like a distressing river, * which the very spirit * of Jehovah has driven along. + 20 “And to Zion + the Repurchaser + will certainly come, and to those turning from transgression * in Jacob,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 21 “And as for me, this is my covenant with them,” + Jehovah has said. “My spirit that is upon you * + and my words that I have put in your mouth + —they will not be removed from your mouth or from the mouth of your offspring * or from the mouth of the offspring of your offspring,” Jehovah has said, “from now on even to time indefinite.” + Footnotes ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eh·khemʹ . ^ Lit., “wasting and ruin [are] in their tracks,” M; LXX, “ruin and misery are in their ways.” See Ro 3:16 . ^ “Them,” TSyVg c and one Heb. ms; 1QIs a M, “it.” ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “coastlands.” ^ Or, “distress will come in like a river.” ^ Or, “wind; blast.” See Ge 1:2 ftn, “Force.” ^ “And to those turning from transgression,” MVg; LXX, “and he shall turn away ungodly practices”; Sy, “and to those turning unrighteousness away.” ^ “You,” masc. sing. ^ Lit., “seed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
