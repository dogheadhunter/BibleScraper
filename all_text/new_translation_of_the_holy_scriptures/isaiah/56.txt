I am a dry tree.’” 4 For this is what Jehovah has said to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and that have chosen what I have delighted in + and that are laying hold of my covenant: + 5 “I will even give to them in my house + and within my walls a monument * + and a name, + something better than sons and daughters. + A name to time indefinite I shall give them, * + one that will not be cut off. + 6 “And the foreigners that have joined themselves to Jehovah to minister to him + and to love the name of Jehovah, + in order to become servants to him, all those keeping the sabbath in order not to profane it and laying hold of my covenant, + 7 I will also bring them to my holy mountain + and make them rejoice inside my house of prayer. + Their whole burnt offerings + and their sacrifices + will be for acceptance upon my altar. + For my own house will be called even a house of prayer for all the peoples.” + 8 The utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, who is collecting together the dispersed ones of Israel, + is: “I shall collect together to him others besides those already collected together of his.” + 9 All YOU wild animals of the open field, come to eat, all YOU wild animals in the forest. + 10 His watchmen are blind. + None of them have taken note. + All of them are speechless dogs; they are not able to bark, + panting, lying down, loving to slumber. + 11 They are even dogs strong in soul[ful desire]; + they have known no satisfaction. + They are also shepherds that have not known how to understand. + They have all of them turned to their own way, each one for his unjust gain from his own border: + 12 “Come, men! Let me take some wine; and let us drink intoxicating liquor to the limit. + And tomorrow will certainly turn out just as today, great in a very much larger way.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “judgment.” ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Mortal man.” Heb., ʼenohshʹ . ^ Lit., “son of the foreign (country).” ^ Lit., “a hand.” But see 1Sa 15:12; 2Sa 18:18 . ^ “Them,” 1QIs a TLXXSyVg; M, “him; each one.” Previous Next Print Share Share
