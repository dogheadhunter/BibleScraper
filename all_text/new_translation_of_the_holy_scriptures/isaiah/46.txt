They hire a metalworker, and he makes it into a god. * + They prostrate themselves, yes, they bow down. + 7 They carry it upon the shoulder, + they bear it and deposit it in its place that it may stand still. From its standing place it does not move away. + One even cries out to it, but it does not answer; out of one’s distress it does not save one. + 8 “Remember this, that YOU people may muster up courage. * Lay it to heart, + YOU transgressors. + 9 Remember the first things of a long time ago, + that I am the Divine One * + and there is no other God, * + nor anyone like me; + 10 the One telling from the beginning the finale, + and from long ago the things that have not been done; + the One saying, ‘My own counsel will stand, + and everything that is my delight I shall do’; + 11 the One calling from the sunrising a bird of prey, + from a distant land the man * to execute my * counsel. + I have even spoken [it]; I shall also bring it in. + I have formed [it], I shall also do it. + 12 “Listen to me, YOU the ones powerful at heart, + YOU the ones far away from righteousness. + 13 I have brought near my righteousness. + It is not far away, + and my own salvation will not be late. + And I will give in Zion salvation, to Israel my beauty.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “you entire remnant.” ^ Lit., “and he makes it a god .” Heb., weya· ʽaseʹh u ʼel . ^ Or, “take courage,” KB 3 , p. 96. ^ Or, “God.” Heb., ʼEl; Gr., ho The·osʹ . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “My,” M margin in agreement with LXX; 1QIs a M, “his.” ^ Lit., “man of.” Heb., ʼish .
