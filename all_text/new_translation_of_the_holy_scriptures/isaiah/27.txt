I will step on such. I will set such on fire at the same time. + 5 Otherwise let him take hold of my stronghold, let him make peace with me; peace let him make with me.” + 6 In the coming [days] Jacob will take root, Israel + will put forth blossoms and actually sprout; and they will simply fill the surface of the productive land * with produce. + 7 As with the stroke of one striking him does one have to strike him? Or as with the slaughter * of his killed ones does he have to be killed? + 8 With a scare cry you will contend with her when sending her forth. He must expel [her] with his blast, a hard one in the day of the east wind. + 9 Therefore by this means the error of Jacob will be atoned for, + and this is all the fruit [when] he takes away his sin, + when he makes all the stones of the altar like chalkstones that have been pulverized, so that the sacred poles * + and the incense stands will not rise up. + 10 For the fortified city will be solitary, the pasture ground will be left to itself and abandoned like a wilderness. + There the calf will graze, and there it will lie down; and he will actually consume her boughs. + 11 When her sprigs have dried up, women coming in will break [them] off, lighting them up. + For it is not a people of keen understanding. + That is why its Maker will show it no mercy, and its own Former will show it no favor. + 12 And it must occur in that day that Jehovah will beat off [the fruit], + from the flowing stream of the River * + to the torrent valley of Egypt, + and so YOU yourselves will be picked up one after the other, + O sons of Israel. 13 And it must occur in that day that there will be a blowing on a great horn, * + and those who are perishing in the land of As·syrʹi·a + and those who are dispersed in the land of Egypt + will certainly come and bow + down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem. + Footnotes ^ “Leviathan,” MSyVg; LXX, “the dragon.” ^ “Foaming wine.” AlCa(Heb.), cheʹmer; that is, fermenting wine. ^ See 13:11 ftn, “Land.” ^ Lit., “killing.” ^ Or, “the Asherim.” ^ That is, the Euphrates. ^ Or, “shofar.” Previous Next Print Share Share
