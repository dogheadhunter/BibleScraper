All his partners themselves will be ashamed, + and the craftsmen are from earthling men. * They will all of them collect themselves together. + They will stand still. They will be in dread. They will be ashamed at the same time. + 12 As for the carver of iron with the billhook, he has been busy [at it] with the coals; and with the hammers he proceeds to form it, and he keeps busy at it with his powerful arm. + Also, he has become hungry, and so without power. He has not drunk water; so he gets tired. 13 As for the wood carver, he has stretched out the measuring line; he traces it out with red chalk; he works it up with a wood scraper; and with a compass he keeps tracing it out, and gradually he makes it like the representation of a man, * + like the beauty of mankind, * to sit in a house. + 14 There is one whose business is to cut down cedars; and he takes a certain species of tree, even a massive tree, and he lets it become strong for himself among the trees of the forest. + He planted the laurel tree, and the pouring rain itself keeps making it get big. 15 And it has become [something] for man * to keep a fire burning. So he takes part of it that he may warm himself. In fact he builds a fire and actually bakes bread. He also works on a god * to which he may bow down. + He has made it into a carved image, + and he prostrates himself to it. 16 Half of it * he actually burns up in a fire. Upon half of it he roasts well the flesh that he eats, and he becomes satisfied. He also warms himself and says: “Aha! I have warmed myself. I have seen the firelight.” 17 But the remainder of it he actually makes into a god itself, into his carved image. He prostrates himself to it and bows down and prays to it and says: “Deliver me, for you are my god.” + 18 They have not come to know, + nor do they understand, + because their eyes have been besmeared so as not to see, + their heart so as to have no insight. + 19 And no one recalls to his heart + or has knowledge or understanding, + saying: “The half of it I have burned up in a fire, and upon its coals I have also baked bread; I roast flesh and eat. But the rest of it shall I make into a mere detestable thing? + To the dried-out wood of a tree shall I prostrate myself?” 20 He is feeding on ashes. + His own heart that has been trifled with has led him astray. + And he does not deliver his soul, nor does he say: “Is there not a falsehood in my right hand?” + 21 “Remember these things, O Jacob, + and you, O Israel, because you are my servant. + I have formed you. + You are a servant belonging to me. O Israel, you will not be forgotten on my part. + 22 I will wipe out your transgressions just as with a cloud, + and your sins just as with a cloud mass. Do return to me, + for I will repurchase you. + 23 “Joyfully cry out, YOU heavens, + for Jehovah has taken action! + Shout in triumph, + all YOU lowest parts * of the earth! + Become cheerful, YOU mountains, + with joyful outcry, you forest and all YOU trees in it! For Jehovah has repurchased Jacob, and on Israel he shows his beauty.” + 24 This is what Jehovah has said, your Repurchaser + and the Former of you from the belly: * “I, Jehovah, am doing everything, stretching out the heavens + by myself, laying out the earth. + Who was with me? 25 [I am] frustrating the signs of the empty talkers, * and [I am] the One that makes diviners themselves act crazily; + the One turning wise men backwards, and the One that turns even their knowledge into foolishness; + 26 the One making the word of his servant come true, and the One that carries out completely the counsel of his own messengers; + the One saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited,’ + and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be rebuilt, + and her desolated places I shall raise up’; + 27 the One saying to the watery deep, ‘Be evaporated; and all your rivers I shall dry up’; + 28 the One saying of Cyrus, * + ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; + even in [my] saying * of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ * and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’” + Footnotes ^ That is, the mother’s womb. ^ “Jeshurun” (meaning “Upright One,” an honorary title for Israel), M; Vg, “Most upright one”; LXX, “beloved Israel”; TSy, “Israel.” ^ Or, “offspring.” ^ Or, “upon his hand: ‘Jehovah’s.’ ” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “Let him stand up, let him call out,” LXX. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “Rock.” Heb., Tsur; TSy, “Strong one.” ^ Or, “desired things.” ^ “And as their witnesses .” Heb., we ʽe·dh eh·hemʹ . The next word ( hemʹmah, “they [are]”) is marked with extraordinary points by the Sopherim, indicating that it should be canceled because of being merely a dittography of the pronominal ending ( hem, “their”) of the word preceding it. The pro­noun for “they” is also absent in Sy. Accordingly the passage should read: “and as their witnesses they [the darlings; the carved images] see nothing and know nothing, in order that they [the formers of the carved image] may be ashamed.” Ignoring the extraordinary points, the passage would read: “and they [Heb., hemʹmah ] are their witnesses that see nothing and that know nothing, in order that they may be ashamed.” See App 2A . ^ “A god.” Heb., ʼel . ^ Or, “from mankind .” Heb., me· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “for an earthling man .” Heb., le ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “He also makes a god [Heb., ʼel ].” ^ “It,” that is, the fuel; possibly tree branches. ^ “Lowest parts,” M; LXXSy, “foundations”; Vg, “extreme parts.” Compare Ps 63:9 ftn. ^ That is, from the mother’s womb. ^ Lit., “the empty talk,” but personalized. ^ “Of Cyrus,” M(Heb., leKhohʹresh )TLXXVg. ^ “Even in [my] saying,” MSy; LXX, “the One saying”; Vg, “I who say.” ^ “To Jerusalem: ‘You will be rebuilt,’ ” TLXXVg.
