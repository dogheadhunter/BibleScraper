On account of you the mountains themselves quaked. + 4 And from time long ago none have heard, + nor have any given ear, nor has an eye itself seen a God, * except you, + that acts for the one that keeps in expectation of him. + 5 You have met up with the one exulting and doing righteousness, + those who keep remembering you in your own ways. + Look! You yourself became indignant, + while we kept sinning + —in them a long time, and should we be saved? + 6 And we become like someone unclean, all of us, and all our acts of righteousness are like a garment for periods of menstruation; + and we shall fade away like leafage, + all of us, and our errors themselves * will carry us away just like a wind. + 7 And there is no one calling upon your name, + no one rousing himself to lay hold on you; for you have concealed your face from us, + and you cause us to melt + by the power of our error. 8 And now, O Jehovah, you are our Father. + We are the clay, + and you are our Potter; * + and all of us are the work of your hand. + 9 Do not be indignant, O Jehovah, to the extreme, + and do not forever remember [our] error. + Look, now, please: we are all your people. + 10 Your own holy cities + have become a wilderness. Zion + itself has become a sheer wilderness, Jerusalem a desolate waste. + 11 Our house of holiness and beauty, + in which our forefathers praised you, + has itself become something for burning in the fire; + and every one of our desirable things + has become a devastation. 12 In the face of these things will you continue keeping yourself in check, + O Jehovah? Will you stay still and let us be afflicted to the extreme? + Footnotes ^ MLXX end chapter 63 here, with this vs as part of vs 19. ^ “A God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “Errors themselves,” 1QIs a TLXXSyVg and 13 Heb. mss; AlCa, Leningrad B 19 A and many Heb. mss, “error itself.” ^ Or, “Former.” Previous Next Print Share Share
