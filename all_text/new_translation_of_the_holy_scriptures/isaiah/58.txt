To loosen the fetters of wickedness, + to release the bands of the yoke bar, + and to send away the crushed ones free, + and that YOU people should tear in two every yoke bar? + 7 Is it not the dividing of your bread out to the hungry one, + and that you should bring the afflicted, homeless people into [your] house? + That, in case you should see someone naked, you must cover him, + and that you should not hide yourself from your own flesh? + 8 “In that case your light would break forth just like the dawn; + and speedily would recuperation spring up for you. + And before you your righteousness would certainly walk; + the very glory of Jehovah would be your rear guard. + 9 In that case you would call, and Jehovah himself would answer; you would cry for help, + and he would say, ‘Here I am!’ “If you will remove from your midst the yoke bar, + the poking out of the finger + and the speaking of what is hurtful; + 10 and you will grant to the hungry one your own soul[ful desire], + and you will satisfy the soul that is being afflicted, your light also will certainly flash up even in the darkness, and your gloom will be like midday. + 11 And Jehovah will be bound to lead + you constantly + and to satisfy your soul even in a scorched land, + and he will invigorate your very bones; + and you must become like a well-watered garden, + and like the source of water, the waters of which do not lie. 12 And at your instance men will * certainly build up the places devastated a long time; * + you will raise up even the foundations of continuous generations. + And you will actually be called the repairer of [the] gap, + the restorer of roadways by which to dwell. * 13 “If in view of the sabbath you will turn back your foot as regards doing your own delights on my holy day, + and will actually call the sabbath an exquisite delight, a holy [day] of Jehovah, one being glorified, + and will actually glorify it rather than doing your own ways, rather than finding what delights you and speaking a word; 14 you will in that case find your exquisite delight in Jehovah, + and I will make you ride upon the high places of the earth; + and I will cause you to eat from the hereditary possession of Jacob your forefather, + for the mouth of Jehovah itself has spoken [it].” + Footnotes ^ Or, “shofar.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “And your sons will,” by a correction. ^ Or, “devastated for time indefinite.” ^ Or, “roadways to [one’s] dwelling,” that is, homeward.
