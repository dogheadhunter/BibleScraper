I must be deprived of the remainder + of my years.” 11 I have said: “I shall not see Jah, even Jah, * in the land of the living ones. + I shall no more look on mankind * —with the inhabitants of [the land of] cessation. * 12 My own habitation * has been pulled out + and removed from me like the tent of shepherds. * I have rolled up my life just like a loom worker; One proceeds to cut me off + from the very threads of the warp. * From daylight till night you keep handing me over. + 13 I have soothed myself * until the morning. + Like a lion, so he keeps breaking all my bones; + From daylight till night you keep handing me over. + 14 Like the swift, the bulbul, so I keep chirping; + I keep cooing like the dove. + My eyes have looked languishingly to the height: + ‘O Jehovah, * I am under oppression. Stand good for me.’ + 15 What shall I speak, and [what] will he actually say to me? + He himself has also acted. + I keep walking solemnly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. + 16 ‘O Jehovah, * on that account they keep living; and as with everybody, thereby is the life of my spirit. + And you will restore me to health and certainly preserve me alive. + 17 Look! For peace I had what was bitter, yes, bitter; + And you yourself have become attached to my soul * [and kept it] from the pit of disintegration. + For you have thrown behind your back all my sins. + 18 For it is not Sheʹol that can laud you; + death itself cannot praise you. + Those going down into the pit cannot look hopefully to your trueness. + 19 The living, the living, he is the one that can laud you, + Just as I can this day. + The father himself can give knowledge + to his own sons concerning your trueness. 20 O Jehovah, [undertake] to save me, + and we shall play my string selections + All the days of our life at the house of Jehovah.’” + 21 And Isaiah proceeded to say: “Let them take a cake of pressed dried figs and rub [it] in upon the boil, + that he may revive.” + 22 Meantime, Hez·e·kiʹah said: “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “with a great weeping.” ^ Lit., “Let there be a going.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal.
