This is our God. * + We have hoped in him, + and he will save us. + This is Jehovah. + We have hoped in him. Let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.” * + 10 For the hand of Jehovah will settle down on this mountain, + and Moʹab must be trodden down + in its place as when a straw heap is trodden down in a manure + place. 11 And he must slap out * his hands in the midst of it * as when a swimmer slaps [them] out to swim, and he must abase its haughtiness + with the tricky movements of his hands. 12 And the fortified city, with your high walls of security, he must lay low; he must abase [it], bring [it] into contact with the earth, to the dust. + Footnotes ^ “My God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aiʹ . ^ “You will deliver them from wicked men,” LXX.
