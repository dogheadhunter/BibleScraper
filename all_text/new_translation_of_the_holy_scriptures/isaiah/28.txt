Jehovah * has someone strong and vigorous. + Like a thunderous storm of hail, + a destructive storm, like a thunderous storm of powerful, flooding waters, + he will certainly do a casting down to the earth with force. * 3 With the feet the eminent crowns of the drunkards of Eʹphra·im will be trampled + down. 4 And the fading flower + of its decoration of beauty that is upon the head of the fertile valley must become like the early fig + before summer, that, when the seer sees it, while it is yet in his palm, he swallows it down. 5 In that day Jehovah of armies will become as a crown of decoration + and as a garland of beauty + to the ones remaining + over * of his people, 6 and as a spirit of justice * to the one sitting in the judgment, + and as mightiness [to] those turning away the battle from the gate. + 7 And these also—because of wine they have gone astray and because of intoxicating liquor they have wandered about. Priest and prophet + —they have gone astray because of intoxicating liquor, they have become confused as a result of the wine, they have wandered + about as a result of the intoxicating liquor; they have gone astray in their seeing, they have reeled as to decision. 8 For the tables themselves have all become full of filthy vomit + —there is no place [without it]. 9 Whom will one instruct in knowledge, + and whom will one make understand what has been heard? * + Those who have been weaned from the milk, those moved away from the breasts? + 10 For it is “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, here a little, there a little.” * + 11 For by those stammering with their lips + and by a different tongue + he will speak to this people, + 12 those to whom he has said: “This is the resting-place. G IVE rest to the weary one. And this is the place of ease,” but who were not willing to hear. + 13 And to them the word of Jehovah will certainly become “command upon command, command upon command, measuring line upon measuring line, measuring line upon measuring line, + here a little, there a little,” in order that they may go and certainly stumble backwards and actually be broken and ensnared and caught. + 14 Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, YOU braggarts, * YOU rulers + of this people who are in Jerusalem: 15 Because YOU men have said: “We have concluded a covenant with Death; + and with Sheʹol we have effected a vision; * + the overflowing flash flood, in case it should pass through, will not come to us, for we have made a lie our refuge + and in falsehood we have concealed ourselves”; + 16 therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Here I am laying * as a foundation in Zion + a stone, * + a tried stone, + the precious corner + of a sure foundation. * + No one exercising faith will get panicky. * + 17 And I will make justice * the measuring line + and righteousness + the leveling instrument; and the hail + must sweep away the refuge of a lie, + and the waters themselves will flood out the very place of concealment. + 18 And YOUR covenant with Death will certainly be dissolved, * + and that vision of YOURS with Sheʹol will not stand. + The overflowing flash flood, when it passes through + — YOU must also become for it a trampling place. + 19 As often as it passes through, it will take YOU men away, + because morning by morning it will pass through, during the day and during the night; and it must become nothing but a reason for quaking + to make [others] understand what has been heard.” * 20 For the couch has proved too short for stretching oneself on, and the woven sheet itself is [too] narrow when wrapping oneself up. 21 For Jehovah will rise up just as at Mount Pe·raʹzim, + he will be agitated just as in the low plain near Gibʹe·on, + that he may do his deed—his deed is strange—and that he may work his work * —his work is unusual. + 22 And now do not show yourselves scoffers, + in order that YOUR bands may not grow strong, for there is an extermination, even something decided upon, that I have heard of from the Sovereign + Lord, Jehovah of armies, for all the land. * + 23 Give ear, YOU men, and listen to my voice; pay attention and listen to my saying. 24 Is it all day long + that the plower plows in order to sow seed, that he loosens and harrows his ground? + 25 Does he not, when he has smoothed out its surface, then scatter black cumin and sprinkle the cumin, + and must he not put in wheat, millet, * + and barley in the appointed place, * + and spelt + as his boundary? + 26 And one corrects + him according to what is right. * His own God * instructs him. + 27 For it is not with a threshing instrument + that black cumin is given a treading; and upon cumin no wheel of a wagon is turned. For it is with a rod + that black cumin is generally beaten out, and cumin with a staff. 28 Is breadstuff itself generally crushed? For never does one incessantly + keep treading it out. + And he must set the roller of his wagon in motion, and his own steeds, [but] he will not crush it. + 29 This also is what has come forth from Jehovah of armies himself, + who has been wonderful in counsel, who has done greatly in effectual working. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the crown of eminence.” ^ Lit., “the valley of fatnesses [or, fertile soils].” ^ Or, “his.” ^ Lit., “hand.” ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
