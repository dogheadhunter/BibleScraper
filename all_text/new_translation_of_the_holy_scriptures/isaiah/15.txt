Because in the night it has been despoiled, Kir + of Moʹab itself has been silenced. 2 He has gone up to The House and to Diʹbon, * + to the high places, to a weeping. Over Neʹbo + and over Medʹe·ba + Moʹab itself howls. On all heads in it there is baldness; + every beard is clipped. 3 In its streets they have girded on sackcloth. + Upon the roofs + thereof * and in the public squares thereof everyone thereof howls, going down with weeping. + 4 And Heshʹbon and E·le·aʹleh + cry out. As far as Jaʹhaz + their voice has been heard. That is why the armed men of Moʹab themselves keep shouting. His very soul has quivered within him. 5 My own heart cries out over Moʹab himself. + The runaways thereof are as far along as Zoʹar + [and] Egʹlath-she·liʹshi·yah. + For on the ascent of Luʹhith + —with weeping [each] one goes up on it; for on the way to Hor·o·naʹim + they arouse the outcry about the catastrophe. 6 For the very waters of Nimʹrim + become sheer desolations. For the green grass has dried up, the grass has come to an end; nothing has become green. + 7 That is why the leftovers and their stored goods that they have put up, they keep carrying them away right over the torrent valley of the poplars. 8 For the outcry has gone around the territory of Moʹab. + The howling thereof is clear to Eg·laʹim; the howling thereof is clear to Beʹer-eʹlim, 9 because the very waters of Diʹmon have become full of blood. For upon Diʹmon I shall place additional things, such as a lion for the escapees of Moʹab who escape and for the remaining ones of the ground. + Footnotes ^ According to 1QIs a M; T, “to the houses of Dibon”; Sy, “to the house of Ribon”; Vg, “The House and Dibon.” ^ Lit., “of her.” Previous Next Print Share Share
