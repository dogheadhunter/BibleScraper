Should the potter * himself be accounted just like the clay? + For should the thing made say respecting its maker: “He did not make me”? + And does the very thing formed actually say respecting its former: “He showed no understanding”? + 17 Is it not yet but a very little time and Lebʹa·non must be turned into an orchard + and the orchard itself will be accounted just as a forest? + 18 And in that day the deaf ones will certainly hear the words of the book, + and out of the gloom and out of the darkness even the eyes of the blind ones will see. + 19 And the meek + ones will certainly increase their rejoicing in Jehovah himself, and even the poor ones of mankind * will be joyful in the Holy One of Israel himself, + 20 because the tyrant must reach his end, + and the bragger must come to his finish, + and all those keeping alert to do harm + must be cut off, 21 those bringing a man into sin by [his] word, + and those who lay bait even for the one reproving in the gate, + and those who push aside the righteous one with empty arguments. + 22 Therefore this is what Jehovah has said to the house of Jacob, he that redeemed Abraham: + “Jacob will not now be ashamed, nor will his own face now grow pale; + 23 for when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, + they will sanctify * my name, + and they will certainly sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, + and the God of Israel * they will regard with awe. + 24 And those who are erring in [their] spirit will actually get to know understanding, and even those who are grumbling will learn instruction.” + Footnotes ^ Possibly meaning “The Altar Hearth of God”; or, “The Lion of God,” referring to Jerusalem. ^ Or, “as Ariel.” ^ “You,” fem. sing., referring to the town. ^ Or, “sentries; outposts.” ^ Lit., “smear yourselves over, and be smeared over.” Compare 6:10 , “paste their very eyes together.” ^ One of 134 scrib­al changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
