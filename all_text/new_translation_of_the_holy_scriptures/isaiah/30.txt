In behalf of the people they will prove of no benefit. 7 And the Egyptians are mere vanity, and they will help simply for nothing. + Therefore I have called this one: * “Raʹhab + —they are for sitting still.” 8 “Now come, write it upon a tablet with them, and inscribe it even in a book, + that it may serve for a future day, for a witness * to time indefinite. + 9 For it is a rebellious people, + untruthful sons, + sons who have been unwilling to hear the law of Jehovah; + 10 who have said to the ones seeing, ‘Y OU must not see,’ and to the ones having visions, ‘Y OU must not envision for us any straightforward things. + Speak to us smooth * things; envision deceptive things. + 11 Turn aside from the way; deviate from the path. + Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease just on account of us.’” + 12 Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel has said: “In view of YOUR rejecting of this word, + and [since] YOU men trust in defrauding and in what is devious and YOU support yourselves on it, + 13 therefore for YOU this error will become like a broken section about to fall down, a swelling out in a highly raised wall, + the breakdown of which may come suddenly, in an instant. + 14 And one will certainly break it as in the breaking of a large jar of the potters, + crushed to pieces without one’s sparing [it], so that there cannot be found among its crushed pieces a fragment of earthenware with which to rake the fire from the fireplace or to skim water from a marshy place.” * + 15 For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, + has said: “By coming back and resting YOU people will be saved. Y OUR mightiness will prove to be simply in keeping undisturbed and in trustfulness.” + But YOU were not willing. + 16 And YOU proceeded to say: “No, but on horses we shall flee!” + That is why YOU will flee. “And on swift [horses] we shall ride!” + That is why those pursuing YOU will show themselves swift. + 17 A thousand will tremble * on account of the rebuke of one; + on account of the rebuke of five YOU will flee until YOU will have remained over like a mast on the top of a mountain and like a signal * on a hill. + 18 And therefore Jehovah will keep in expectation of showing YOU favor, + and therefore he will rise up to show YOU mercy. + For Jehovah is a God of judgment. * + Happy + are all those keeping in expectation of him. + 19 When the very people in Zion + will dwell in Jerusalem, + you * will by no means weep. + He * will without fail show you favor at the sound of your outcry; as soon as he hears it he will actually answer you. + 20 And Jehovah * will certainly give YOU people bread in the form of distress and water in the form of oppression; + yet your Grand Instructor * will no longer hide himself, and your eyes must become [eyes] seeing your Grand Instructor. + 21 And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: “This is the way. + Walk in it, YOU people,” in case YOU people should go to the right or in case YOU should go to the left. + 22 And YOU people * must defile the overlaying of your * graven images of silver + and the close-fitting covering of your molten + statue of gold. + You will scatter them. + Like a menstruating woman, you will say to it: “Mere dirt!” + 23 And he will certainly give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, + and as the produce of the ground bread, which must become fat and oily. + Your livestock will graze in that day in a spacious pasture. + 24 And the cattle and the full-grown asses cultivating the ground will eat fodder seasoned with sorrel, which was winnowed with the shovel + and with the fork. 25 And upon every high mountain and upon every elevated hill there must come to be streams, + water ditches, in the day of the big slaughter when the towers fall. + 26 And the light of the full moon must become as the light of the glowing [sun]; and the very light of the glowing [sun] will become seven times as much, + like the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah binds up the breakdown + of his people and heals + even the severe wound resulting from the stroke by him. 27 Look! The name of Jehovah is coming from far away, burning with his anger + and with heavy clouds. As for his lips, they have become full of denunciation, and his tongue is like a devouring fire. + 28 And his spirit * is like a flooding torrent that reaches clear to the neck, + to swing the nations to and fro with a sieve + of worthlessness; and a bridle + that causes one to wander about will be in the jaws of the peoples. + 29 Y OU people will come to have a song + like that in the night that one sanctifies oneself for a festival, + and rejoicing of heart like that of one walking with a flute + to enter into the mountain of Jehovah, + to the Rock * of Israel. + 30 And Jehovah will certainly make the dignity of his voice + to be heard and will make the descending of his arm to be seen, + in the raging of anger + and the flame of a devouring fire + [and] cloudburst and rainstorm + and hailstones. + 31 For because of the voice of Jehovah As·syrʹi·a will be struck with terror; + he will strike [it] even with a staff. + 32 And every swing of his rod of chastisement * that Jehovah will cause to settle down upon [As·syrʹi·a] will certainly prove to be with tambourines and with harps; + and with battles of brandishing * he will actually fight against them. + 33 For his Toʹpheth * + is set in order from recent times; it is also prepared for the king himself. + He has made its pile deep. Fire and wood are in abundance. The breath * of Jehovah, like a torrent of sulphur, is burning against it. + Footnotes ^ Or, “form an alliance,” by pouring out a libation.
