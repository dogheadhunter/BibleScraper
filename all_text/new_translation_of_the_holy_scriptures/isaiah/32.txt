A king + will reign for righteousness + itself; and as respects princes, * + they will rule as princes for justice itself. 2 And each one must prove to be like a hiding place from the wind * and a place of concealment from the rainstorm, + like streams of water in a waterless country, + like the shadow of a heavy crag in an exhausted land. + 3 And the eyes of those seeing will not be pasted together, * and the very ears of those hearing will pay attention. + 4 And the heart itself of those who are overhasty will consider knowledge, + and even the tongue of the stammerers will be quick in speaking clear things. + 5 The senseless one will no longer be called generous; and as for the unprincipled man, he will not be said to be noble; + 6 because the senseless one himself will speak mere senselessness, + and his very heart will work at what is hurtful, + to work at apostasy + and to speak against Jehovah what is wayward, to cause the soul of the hungry one to go empty, + and he causes even the thirsty one to go without drink itself. 7 As for the unprincipled man, his instruments are bad; + he himself has given counsel for acts of loose conduct, + to wreck the afflicted ones with false sayings, + even when someone poor speaks what is right. 8 As regards the generous one, it is for generous things that he has given counsel; and in favor of generous things he himself will rise up. + 9 “Y OU women who are at ease, rise up, listen to my voice! + Y OU careless * daughters, give ear to my saying! 10 Within a year and some days YOU careless ones will be agitated, + because the grape picking will have come to an end [but] no [fruit] gathering will come in. + 11 Tremble, YOU women who are at ease! Be agitated, YOU careless ones! Undress and make yourselves naked, and gird [sackcloth] upon the loins. + 12 Beat yourselves upon the breasts in lamentation + over the desirable fields, + over the fruit-bearing vine. 13 Upon the ground of my people merely thorns, spiny bushes come up, + for they are upon all the houses of exultation, yes, the highly elated town. + 14 For the dwelling tower itself has been forsaken, + the very hubbub of the city has been abandoned; Oʹphel + and the watchtower themselves have become bare fields, for time indefinite the exultation of zebras, the pasture of droves; 15 until upon us the spirit is poured out from on high, + and the wilderness will have become an orchard, and the orchard itself is accounted as a real forest. + 16 “And in the wilderness justice will certainly reside, and in the orchard righteousness itself will dwell. + 17 And the work of the [true] righteousness must become peace; + and the service of the [true] righteousness, quietness and security to time indefinite. + 18 And my people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting-places. + 19 And it will certainly hail when the forest goes down + and the city becomes low in an abased state. + 20 “Happy are YOU people who are sowing seed alongside all waters, + sending forth the feet of the bull and of the ass.” + Footnotes ^ “And as respects princes .” Heb., u·le sa·rimʹ . ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach; Lat., venʹto . ^ “Will not be pasted together,” by a slight correction of M, in agreement with TSyVg; M, “will not look.” ^ Or, “trusting; unsuspecting.” Previous Next Print Share Share
