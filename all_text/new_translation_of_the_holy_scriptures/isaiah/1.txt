I shall relieve myself of my adversaries, and I will avenge + myself on my enemies. + 25 And I will turn back my hand upon * you, * and I shall smelt away your scummy dross as with lye, and I will remove all your waste products. + 26 And I will bring back again judges for you as at the first, and counselors for you as at the start. + After this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town. + 27 With justice * Zion herself will be redeemed, + and those returning of her, with righteousness. + 28 And the crash of revolters and that of sinful ones will be at the same time, + and those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish. + 29 For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that YOU people desired, + and YOU will be abashed because of the gardens that YOU have chosen. + 30 For YOU will become like a big tree the foliage of which is withering, + and like a garden that has no water. 31 And the vigorous man will certainly become tow, + and the product of his activity a spark; and both of them will certainly go up in flames at the same time, with no one to do the extinguishing.” + Footnotes ^ “Isaiah.” Heb., Yesha·ʽeyaʹhu, meaning “Salvation of Jehovah”; LXX Bagster (Gr.), He·sa·iʹas; Lat., I·sa·iʹas . ^ Meaning “Strong.” Heb., ʼA·mohtsʹ . ^ Meaning “My Strength Is Jehovah.” Heb., ʽUz·zi·yaʹhu . ^ Meaning “Jehovah Is Perfect”; or, “May Jehovah Complete.” Heb., Yoh·thamʹ . ^ Meaning “He [Jehovah] Has Taken Hold.” Heb., ʼA·chazʹ . ^ Meaning “Jehovah Strengthens.” Heb., Yechiz·qi·yaʹhu . ^ Or, “transgressed.” ^ “Its owner .” Heb., beʽa·l avʹ, a pl. form of baʹʽal, to denote excellence. ^ Or, “left over to us survivors, we should easily have become.” ^ Or, “convocation.” ^ “Uncanny power, state of taboo,” KB, p. 20; LXX, “fasting.” ^ Or, “bloodguilt.” Lit., “bloods.” ^ Lit., “scarlet pieces.” ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ LXXIt add “Zion.” ^ Or, “judgment.” Heb., mish·patʹ . ^ “Your,” fem. sing., addressed to Zion, the once “faithful town,” in vs 21. ^ Or, “Your liquor.” ^ “The [true] Lord.” Heb., ha·ʼA·dhohnʹ; Gr., ho De·spoʹtes .
