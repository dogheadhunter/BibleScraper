+ Why is it that I hoped for it to produce grapes, but it gradually produced wild grapes? 5 And now, please, may I make known to YOU men what I am doing to my vineyard: There will be a removing of its hedge, + and it must be destined for burning down. + There must be a breaking down of its stone wall, and it must be destined for a place of trampling. + 6 And I shall set it as a thing destroyed. + It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed. + And it must come up with the thornbush and weeds; + and upon the clouds I shall lay a command to keep from precipitating any rain upon it. + 7 For the vineyard + of Jehovah of armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the plantation of which he was fond. + And he kept hoping for judgment, + but, look! the breaking of law; * for righteousness, but, look! an outcry.” + 8 Woe to the ones joining house to house, + [and] those who annex field to field until there is no more room + and YOU men have been made to dwell all by yourselves in the midst of the land! 9 In my ears Jehovah of armies [has sworn that] many houses, though great and good, will become an outright object of astonishment, without an inhabitant. + 10 For even ten acres + of vineyard will produce but one bath * measure, + and even a hoʹmer * measure of seed will produce but an eʹphah * measure. + 11 Woe to those who are getting up early in the morning that they may seek just intoxicating liquor, + who are lingering till late in the evening darkness so that wine itself inflames them! + 12 And there must prove to be harp and stringed instrument, tambourine and flute, and wine at their feasts; + but the activity of Jehovah they do not look at, and the work of his hands they have not seen. + 13 Therefore my people will have to go into exile for lack of knowledge; + and their glory will be famished men, * + and their crowd will be parched with thirst. + 14 Therefore Sheʹol * has made its soul * spacious and has opened its mouth wide beyond bounds; + and what is splendid in her, * also her crowd and her uproar and the exultant one, will certainly go down into it. + 15 And earthling man will bow down, and man will become low, and even the eyes of the high ones will become low. + 16 And Jehovah of armies will become high through judgment, + and the [true] God, * the Holy One, + will certainly sanctify himself through righteousness. + 17 And the male lambs will actually graze as in their pasture; and the desolate places of well-fed animals alien residents * will eat. + 18 Woe to those drawing error with ropes of untruth, and as with wagon cords sin; + 19 those who are saying: “Let his work hasten; do let it come quickly, * in order that we may see [it]; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know [it]!” + 20 Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, + those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness, those who are putting bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! + 21 Woe to those wise in their own eyes and discreet even in front of their own faces! + 22 Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine, and to the men with vital energy for mixing intoxicating liquor, + 23 those who are pronouncing the wicked one righteous in consideration of a bribe, + and who take away even the righteousness * of the righteous one * from him! + 24 Therefore just as a tongue of fire eats up the stubble + and into the flames mere dried grass sinks down, their very rootstock will become just like a musty smell, + and their blossom itself will go up just like powder, because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of armies, + and the saying of the Holy One of Israel they have disrespected. + 25 That is why the anger of Jehovah has grown hot against his people, and he will stretch out his hand against them and strike them. + And the mountains will be agitated, + and their dead bodies will become like the offal in the midst of the streets. + In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still. 26 And he has raised up a signal to a great nation * far away, + and he has whistled to it at the extremity of the earth; + and, look! in haste it will swiftly come in. + 27 There is no one tired nor is anyone stumbling among them. * No one is drowsy and no one sleeps. And the belt around their loins will certainly not be opened, nor the laces of their sandals be torn in two; 28 because their arrows are sharpened and all their bows are bent. + The very hoofs of their horses will have to be accounted as flint itself, + and their wheels as a storm wind. + 29 The roaring of theirs is like that of a lion, and they roar like maned young lions. + And they will growl and grab hold of the prey and bring [it] safely away, and there will be no deliverer. + 30 And they will growl over it in that day as with the growling of the sea. + And one will actually gaze at the land, and, look! there is distressing darkness; + and even the light has grown dark because of the drops falling on it.
