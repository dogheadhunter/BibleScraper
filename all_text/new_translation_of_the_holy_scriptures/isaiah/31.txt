And Jehovah himself will stretch out his hand, and he that is offering help will have to stumble, and he that is being helped will have to fall, + and at the same time they will all of them come to an end. 4 For this is what Jehovah has said to me: “Just as the lion growls, even the maned young lion, + over its prey, when there is called out against it a full number of shepherds, [and] in spite of their voice he will not be terrified and in spite of their commotion he will not stoop; in the same way Jehovah of armies will come down to wage war over Mount Zion and over her hill. + 5 Like birds flying, Jehovah of armies will in the same way defend Jerusalem. + Defending [her], he will also certainly deliver [her]. + Sparing * [her], he must also cause [her] to escape.” 6 “Return, + YOU people, to the One against whom the sons of Israel have gone deep in their revolt. + 7 For in that day they will reject each one his worthless gods of silver and his valueless gods of gold, + that YOUR hands have made for yourselves as a sin. + 8 And the As·syrʹi·an must fall by the sword, not [that of] a man; * and a sword, not [that of] earthling man, * will devour him. + And he must flee because of the sword, and his own young men will come to be for forced labor itself. 9 And his own crag will pass away out of sheer fright, and because of the signal * + his princes must be terrified,” is the utterance of Jehovah, whose light is in Zion and whose furnace + is in Jerusalem.
