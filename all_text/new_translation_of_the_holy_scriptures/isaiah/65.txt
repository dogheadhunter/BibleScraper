Do not approach me, for I shall certainly convey holiness to you.’ * + These are a smoke in my nostrils, + a fire burning all day long. * + 6 “Look! It is written before me. + I shall not keep still, + but I will render a reward; I will even render the reward + into their own bosom, * + 7 for their * own errors and for the errors of their forefathers at the same time,” + Jehovah has said. “Because they have made sacrificial smoke upon the mountains, and upon the hills + they have reproached me, + I will also measure out their wages first of all into their own bosom.” + 8 This is what Jehovah has said: “In the same way that the new wine + is found in the cluster and someone has to say, ‘Do not ruin it, + because there is a blessing in it,’ + so I shall do for the sake of my servants * in order not to bring everybody to ruin. + 9 And I will bring forth out of Jacob an offspring * + and out of Judah the hereditary possessor of my mountains; + and my chosen ones must take possession of it, * + and my own servants will reside there. + 10 And Sharʹon + must become a pasture ground for sheep + and the low plain of Aʹchor + a resting-place for cattle, for my people who will have looked for me. + 11 “But YOU men are those leaving Jehovah, + those forgetting my holy mountain, + those setting in order a table for the god of Good Luck * + and those filling up mixed wine for the god of Destiny. * + 12 And I will destine YOU men to the sword, + and YOU will all of YOU bow down to being slaughtered; + for the reason that I called, + but YOU did not answer; I spoke, but YOU did not listen; + and YOU kept doing what was bad in my eyes, + and the thing in which I took no delight YOU chose.” + 13 Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Look! My own servants will eat, + but YOU yourselves will go hungry. + Look! My own servants will drink, + but YOU yourselves will go thirsty. + Look! My own servants will rejoice, + but YOU yourselves will suffer shame. + 14 Look! My own servants will cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart, + but YOU yourselves will make outcries because of the pain of heart and YOU will howl because of sheer breakdown of spirit. + 15 And YOU men will certainly lay up YOUR name for an oath * by my chosen ones, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will actually put [ YOU ] individually * to death, * + but his own servants he will call by another name; + 16 so that anyone blessing himself in the earth will bless himself by the God * of faith, * + and anyone making a sworn statement in the earth will swear by the God of faith; + because the former distresses will actually be forgotten and because they will actually be concealed from my eyes. + 17 “For here I am creating new heavens + and a new earth; + and the former things will not be called to mind, + neither will they come up into the heart. + 18 But exult, YOU people, + and be joyful forever in what I am creating. + For here I am creating Jerusalem a cause for joyfulness and her people a cause for exultation. + 19 And I will be joyful in Jerusalem and exult in my people; + and no more will there be heard in her the sound of weeping or the sound of a plaintive cry.” + 20 “No more will there come to be a suckling a few days old from that place, + neither an old man that does not fulfill his days; + for one will die as a mere boy, although a hundred years of age; and as for the sinner, although a hundred years of age he will have evil called down upon him. + 21 And they will certainly build houses and have occupancy; + and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage. + 22 They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; + and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full. + 23 They will not toil for nothing, + nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; + because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, + and their descendants with them. + 24 And it will actually occur that before they call out I myself shall answer; + while they are yet speaking, I myself shall hear. + 25 “The wolf + and the lamb themselves will feed as one, + and the lion will eat straw just like the bull; + and as for the serpent, his food will be dust. + They will do no harm + nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,” + Jehovah has said.
