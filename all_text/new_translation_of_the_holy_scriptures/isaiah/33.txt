Their very heroes * have cried out in the street; the very messengers * of peace + will weep bitterly. 8 The highways have been made desolate; + the one passing over the path has ceased. + He has broken the covenant; + he has contemned the cities; + he has taken no account of mortal man. * + 9 The land * has gone mourning, has withered away. + Lebʹa·non has become abashed; + it has moldered. * Sharʹon + has become like the desert plain; and Baʹshan and Carʹmel are shaking off [their leaves]. + 10 “Now I will rise up,” + says Jehovah, “now I will exalt myself; + now I will lift myself up. + 11 Y OU people conceive dried grass; + YOU will give birth to stubble. Y OUR own spirit, as a fire, + will eat YOU up. + 12 And peoples must become as the burnings of lime. As thorns cut away, they will be set ablaze even with fire. + 13 Hear, YOU men who are far away, what I must do! + And know, YOU who are nearby, my mightiness. + 14 In Zion the sinners have come to be in dread; + shivering has grabbed hold of the apostates: + ‘Who of us can reside for any time with a devouring fire? + Who of us can reside for any time with long-lasting conflagrations?’ + 15 “There is one who is walking in continual righteousness + and speaking what is upright, + who is rejecting the unjust gain from frauds, + who is shaking his hands clear from taking hold on a bribe, + who is stopping up his ear from listening to bloodshed, and who is closing his eyes so as not to see what is bad. + 16 He is the one that will reside on the heights themselves; + his secure height will be craggy places difficult to approach. + His own bread will certainly be given [him]; + his water supply will be unfailing.” + 17 A king in his handsomeness is what your eyes will behold; + they will see a land far away. + 18 Your own heart will comment in low tones + on a frightful thing: “Where is the secretary? Where is the one that does the paying out? + Where is the one counting the towers?” + 19 No insolent * people will you see, a people too deep in language * to listen to, of a stammering tongue without [your] understanding. + 20 Behold Zion, + the town of our festal occasions! + Your own eyes will see Jerusalem an undisturbed abiding place, a tent that no one will pack up. + Never will its tent pins be pulled out, and none of its ropes will be torn in two. + 21 But there the Majestic One, + Jehovah, will be for us a place of rivers, + of wide * canals. On it no galley fleet will go, and no majestic ship will pass over it. 22 For Jehovah is our Judge, + Jehovah is our Statute-giver, + Jehovah is our King; + he himself will save us. + 23 Your * ropes must hang loose; their mast they will not hold firmly erect; they have not spread a sail. At that time even spoil in abundance will have to be divided up; the lame ones themselves will actually take a big plunder. + 24 And no resident will say: “I am sick.” + The people that are dwelling in [the land] * will be those pardoned for their error. + Footnotes ^ “You,” T, eight Heb. mss and four printed ed.; 1QIs a M, 20 Heb. mss and seven printed ed., “him.” ^ “Our,” TSyVg c and some Heb. mss; 1QIs a M and some Heb. mss, “their.” ^ Or, “envoys.” ^ “Their very heroes .” Heb., ʼer·ʼel· lamʹ; the meaning is uncertain. ^ “Mortal man.” Heb., ʼenohshʹ . ^ Or, “it has been taken by lice.” ^ Or, “earth.” ^ Or, “barbarous”; or, “presumptuous.” ^ Lit., “lip.” ^ Compare Ge 34:21 ftn, “Wide.” ^ “Your,” fem. sing. ^ Lit., “it,” fem., referring to the land or earth, fem.
