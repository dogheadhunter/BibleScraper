+ Who has seen things like these? + Will a land + be brought forth with labor pains in one day? + Or will a nation + be born at one time? * + For Zion has come into labor pains as well as given birth to her sons. 9 “As for me, shall I cause the breaking through and not cause the giving birth?” + says Jehovah. “Or am I causing a giving birth and do I actually cause a shutting up?” your * God * has said. 10 Rejoice with Jerusalem and be joyful with her, + all YOU lovers of her. + Exult greatly with her, all YOU keeping yourselves in mourning over her; + 11 for the reason that YOU will suck and certainly get satisfaction from the breast of full consolation by her; * for the reason that YOU will sip and experience exquisite delight from the teat of her glory. + 12 For this is what Jehovah has said: “Here I am extending to her peace just like a river + and the glory of nations just like a flooding torrent, + and YOU will certainly suck. + Upon the flank YOU will be carried, and upon the knees YOU will be fondled. + 13 Like a man * whom his own mother keeps comforting, so I myself shall keep comforting YOU people; + and in the case of Jerusalem YOU will be comforted. + 14 And YOU will certainly see, and YOUR heart will be bound to exult, + and YOUR very bones + will sprout just like tender grass. + And the hand of Jehovah will certainly be made known to his servants, + but he will actually denounce his enemies.” + 15 “For here Jehovah himself comes as a very fire, + and his chariots are like a storm wind, + in order to pay back his anger with sheer rage and his rebuke with flames of fire. + 16 For as fire Jehovah himself will for a fact take up the controversy, yes, with his sword, + against all flesh; and the slain of Jehovah will certainly become many. + 17 Those sanctifying themselves and cleansing themselves for the gardens + behind one * in the center, eating the flesh of the pig + and the loathsome thing, even the jumping rodent, * + they will all together reach their end,” is the utterance of Jehovah. 18 “And as regards their works + and their thoughts, + I am coming in order to collect all the nations and tongues together; + and they will have to come and see my glory.” + 19 “And I will set among them a sign, * + and I will send some of those who are escaped to the nations, + [to] Tarʹshish, + Pul, * and Lud, + those drawing the bow, * Tuʹbal and Jaʹvan, + the faraway islands, * + who have not heard a report about me or seen my glory; + and they will for certain tell about my glory among the nations. + 20 And they will actually bring all YOUR brothers out of all the nations + as a gift to Jehovah, + on horses and in chariots and in covered wagons and on mules and on swift she-camels, + up to my holy mountain, * + Jerusalem,” Jehovah has said, “just as when the sons of Israel bring the gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.” + 21 “And from them also I shall take some for the priests, for the Levites,” * Jehovah has said. 22 “For just as the new heavens + and the new earth + that I am making are standing before me,” + is the utterance of Jehovah, “so the offspring * of YOU people + and the name of YOU people will keep standing.” + 23 “And it will certainly occur that from new moon to new moon * and from sabbath to sabbath * all flesh will come in to bow down before me,” + Jehovah has said. 24 “And they will actually go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men * that were transgressing against me; + for the very worms upon them * will not die and their fire itself will not be extinguished, + and they must become something repulsive to all flesh.” + Footnotes ^ “Came to be,” MTVg; LXXSy, “are all mine.” ^ “Trembling at.” Or, “anxious toward.” ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “upon uncanny things.” ^ Or, “at once?” ^ “Your,” fem. sing., referring to “Zion,” or “Jerusalem.” ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aʹyikh . ^ Or, “of her consolations.” ^ “Like a man .” Heb., ke ʼishʹ . ^ “One,” masc. in M but fem. in M margin and 13 Heb. mss. ^ Or, “the jerboa.” ^ “Sign.” Heb., ʼohth; Lat., siʹgnum . ^ “Pul,” 1QIs a MSy; LXX, “Put.” ^ “Those drawing the bow,” 1QIs a MSy; LXX, “Meshech.” ^ Or, “coastlands.” ^ “Mountain,” 1QIs a MTSyVg; LXX, “city.” ^ “For the Levites,” 1QIs a M; TLXXSyVg and some Heb. mss, “and for the Levites.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or, “from month to month.” ^ Or, “from week to week.” ^ “The men .” Heb., ha· ʼana·shimʹ , pl. of ʼish . ^ Lit., “their very worm.” Previous Next Print Share Share
