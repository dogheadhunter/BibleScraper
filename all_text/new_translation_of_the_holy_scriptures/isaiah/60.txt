They have all of them been collected together; + they have come to you. + From far away your own sons keep coming, and your daughters who will be taken care of on the flank. + 5 At that time you will see * and certainly become radiant, + and your heart will actually quiver and expand, because to you the wealthiness of the sea will direct itself; the very resources of the nations will come to you. + 6 The heaving mass of camels itself will cover you, the young male camels of Midʹi·an and of Eʹphah. + All those from Sheʹba + —they will come. Gold and frankincense they will carry. And the praises of Jehovah they will announce. + 7 All the flocks of Keʹdar + —they will be collected together to you. The rams of Ne·baʹioth + —they will minister to you. * + With approval they will come up upon my altar, + and I shall beautify my own house of beauty. + 8 “Who are these that come flying just like a cloud, + and like doves to their birdhouse holes? 9 For in me the islands themselves will keep hoping, + the ships of Tarʹshish + also as at the first, in order to bring your sons from far away, + their silver and their gold being with them, + to the name + of Jehovah your God * and to the Holy One of Israel, + for he will have beautified you. + 10 And foreigners * will actually build your walls, + and their own kings will minister * to you; + for in my indignation I shall have struck you, + but in my goodwill I shall certainly have mercy upon you. + 11 “And your gates will actually be kept open * constantly; + they will not be closed even by day or by night, in order to bring to you the resources of the nations, + and their kings will be taking the lead. + 12 For any nation and any kingdom that will not serve you will perish; and the nations themselves will without fail come to devastation. + 13 “To you the very glory of Lebʹa·non will come, the juniper tree, the ash tree and the cypress at the same time, + in order to beautify the place of my sanctuary; + and I shall glorify the very place of my feet. + 14 “And to you the sons of those afflicting you must go, bowing down; + and all those treating you disrespectfully must bend down at the very soles of your feet, + and they will have to call you the city of Jehovah, Zion + of the Holy One of Israel. 15 “Instead of your proving to be one left entirely and hated, with nobody passing through, + I will even set you as a thing of pride to time indefinite, an exultation for generation after generation. + 16 And you will actually suck the milk of nations, + and the breast of kings you will suck; + and you will be certain to know that I, Jehovah, + am your Savior, + and the Powerful One + of Jacob is your Repurchaser. * + 17 Instead of the copper I shall bring in gold, + and instead of the iron I shall bring in silver, and instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron; and I will appoint peace as your overseers * + and righteousness as your task assigners. + 18 “No more will violence be heard in your land, despoiling or breakdown within your boundaries. + And you will certainly call your own walls Salvation + and your gates Praise. 19 For you the sun will no more prove to be a light by day, and for brightness the moon itself will no more give you light. And Jehovah must become to you an indefinitely lasting light, + and your God * your beauty. + 20 No more will your sun set, nor will your moon go on the wane; for Jehovah himself will become for you an indefinitely lasting light, + and the days of your mourning will have come to completion. + 21 And as for your people, all of them will be righteous; + to time indefinite they will hold possession of the land, + the sprout of my * planting, + the work of my hands, + for [me] to be beautified. + 22 The little one himself will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation. + I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.” + Footnotes ^ “O woman,” because the one addressed as “you” and the verbs in Heb. are fem. sing.
