Yes, the very fire + for your own adversaries will eat them up. * 12 O Jehovah, you will adjudge peace to us, + because even all our works you have performed for us. + 13 O Jehovah our God, * other masters * besides you have acted as owners of us. + By you only shall we make mention of your name. + 14 They are dead; they will not live. + Impotent in death, * + they will not rise up. + Therefore you have turned your attention that you might annihilate them and destroy all mention of them. + 15 You have added to the nation; O Jehovah, you have added to the nation; + you have glorified yourself. + You have extended afar all the borders of the land. * + 16 O Jehovah, during distress they have turned their attention to you; + they have poured out a whisper [of prayer] when they had your disciplining. + 17 Just as a pregnant woman draws near to giving birth, has labor pains, cries out in her birth pangs, so we have become because of you, O Jehovah. + 18 We have become pregnant, we have had labor pains; + as it were, we have given birth to wind. * No real salvation do we accomplish as regards the land, + and no inhabitants for the productive land proceed to fall [in birth]. + 19 “Your dead ones will live. + A corpse of mine * —they will rise up. + Awake and cry out joyfully, YOU residents in the dust! + For your dew + is as the dew of mallows, + and the earth itself will let even those impotent in death * drop [in birth]. + 20 “Go, my people, enter into your interior rooms, and shut your doors behind you. + Hide yourself for but a moment until the denunciation passes over. + 21 For, look! Jehovah is coming forth from his place to call to account the error of the inhabitant of the land against him, + and the land will certainly expose her bloodshed * + and will no longer cover over her killed ones.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “that is unshakable.” ^ Lit., “[in] peace, peace.” ^ Or, “it.” ^ See 12:2 ftn, “Jah.” ^ “In Jah Jehovah.” Heb., beYahʹ Yehwahʹ .
