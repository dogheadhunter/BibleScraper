Let the earth and that which fills it listen, + the productive land * + and all its produce. + 2 For Jehovah has indignation against all the nations, + and rage against all their army. + He must devote them to destruction; he must give them to the slaughter. + 3 And their slain ones will be thrown out; and as for their carcasses, their stink will ascend; + and the mountains must melt because of their blood. + 4 And all those of the army of the heavens must rot away. + And the heavens must be rolled up, + just like a book scroll; and their army will all shrivel away, just as the leafage shrivels off the vine and like a shriveled [fig] off the fig tree. + 5 “For in the heavens my sword + will certainly be drenched. Look! Upon Eʹdom it will descend, + and upon the people devoted by me to destruction + in justice. 6 Jehovah has a sword; it must be filled with blood; + it must be made greasy with the fat, with the blood of young rams and he-goats, with the fat + of the kidneys of rams. For Jehovah has a sacrifice in Bozʹrah, and a great slaughtering in the land of Eʹdom. + 7 And the wild bulls + must come down with them, and young bulls with the powerful ones; + and their land must be drenched with blood, and their very dust will be made greasy with the fat.” + 8 For Jehovah has a day of vengeance, + a year of retributions for the legal case over Zion. + 9 And her * torrents must be changed into pitch, and her dust into sulphur; and her land must become as burning pitch. + 10 By night or by day it will not be extinguished; to time indefinite its smoke will keep ascending. + From generation to generation she will be parched; + forever and ever no one will be passing across her. + 11 And the pelican and the porcupine must take possession of her, and long-eared owls and ravens themselves will reside in her; + and he must stretch out over her the measuring line + of emptiness and the stones of wasteness. 12 Her nobles—there are none there whom they will call to the kingship itself, and her very princes will all become nothing. + 13 On her dwelling towers thorns must come up, nettles and thorny weeds in her fortified places; + and she must become an abiding place of jackals, + the courtyard for the ostriches. * + 14 And haunters of waterless regions must meet up with howling animals, and even the goat-shaped demon + will call to its companion. Yes, there the nightjar * will certainly take its ease and find for itself a resting-place. + 15 There the arrow snake has made its nest and lays [eggs], and it must hatch [them] and gather [them] together under its shadow. Yes, there the gledes + must collect themselves together, each one with her mate. 16 Search for yourselves in the book + of Jehovah and read out loud: not one has been missing of them; + they actually do not fail to have each one her mate, for it is the mouth of Jehovah * that has given the command, + and it is his spirit that has collected them together. + 17 And it is He that has cast for them the lot, and his own hand has apportioned the place * to them by the measuring line. + To time indefinite they will take possession of it; for generation after generation they will reside in it.
