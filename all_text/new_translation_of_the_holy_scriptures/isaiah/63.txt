And I kept treading them in my anger, + and I kept trampling them down in my rage. + And their spurting blood kept spattering upon my garments, + and all my clothing I have polluted. 4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, + and the very year of my repurchased ones has come. 5 And I kept looking, but there was no helper; and I began to show myself astonished, but there was no one offering support. + So my arm furnished me salvation, + and my rage + was what supported me. 6 And I kept stamping down peoples in my anger, and I proceeded to make them drunk * with my rage + and to bring down to the earth their spurting blood.” + 7 The loving-kindnesses * of Jehovah I shall mention, + the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah has rendered to us, + even the abundant goodness to the house of Israel + that he has rendered to them according to his mercies + and according to the abundance of his loving-kindnesses. 8 And he went on to say: “Surely they are my people, + sons that will not prove false.” + So it was to them that he came to be a Savior. + 9 During all their distress it was distressing to him. * + And his own personal messenger * saved them. + In his love and in his compassion he himself repurchased them, + and he proceeded to lift them up and carry them all the days of long ago. + 10 But they themselves rebelled + and made his holy spirit feel hurt. + He now was changed into an enemy + of theirs; he himself warred against them. + 11 And one * began to remember the days of long ago, Moses his servant: * “Where is the One that brought them up out of the sea + with the shepherds * of his flock? + Where is the One that put within him His own holy spirit? + 12 The One making His beautiful arm + go at the right hand of Moses; the One splitting the waters from before them + in order to make an indefinitely lasting name for his own self; + 13 the One making them walk through the surging waters * so that, like a horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble? + 14 Just as when a beast itself goes down into the valley plain, the very spirit of Jehovah proceeded to make them rest.” + Thus you led your people in order to make a beautiful name for your own self. + 15 Look from heaven + and see out of your lofty abode of holiness and beauty. + Where are your zeal + and your full might, the commotion of your inward parts, + and your mercies? + Toward me they have restrained themselves. * + 16 For you are our Father; + although Abraham himself may not have known us and Israel himself may not recognize us, you, O Jehovah, are our Father. Our Repurchaser * of long ago is your name. + 17 Why do you, O Jehovah, keep making us wander from your ways? Why do you make our heart hard against the fear of you? + Come back for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your hereditary possession. + 18 For a little while your holy people + had possession. Our own adversaries have stamped down your sanctuary. + 19 We have for a long time become as those over whom you did not rule, as those upon whom your name had not been called. + Footnotes ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “I proceeded to break them to pieces,” some Heb. mss and early printed ed. ^ Or, “The acts of loyal love.” ^ According to M margin and 17 Heb. mss; M, “During all their distress he was no adversary.” ^ Lit., “And the messenger of his face.” ^ Or, “he.” ^ “His servant,” Sy and some Heb. mss; 1QIs a MVg, “[and] his people.” ^ “Shepherds,” 1QIs a MVg; TLXXSy and 11 Heb. mss, “shepherd.” ^ Or, “through the watery deeps .” Heb., bat· teho·mohthʹ . ^ Or, “mercies, [that] have restrained themselves even toward me?” ^ “Our Repurchaser ( Redeemer ).” By extension of thought, “Our Avenger ( Vindicator ).” Heb., go·ʼal eʹnu; Lat., re·demʹptor noʹster .
