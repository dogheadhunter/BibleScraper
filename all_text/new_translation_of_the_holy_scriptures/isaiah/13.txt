Lift up the voice to them, wave the hand, + that they may come into the entrances of the nobles. + 3 I myself have issued the command to my sanctified ones. * + I have also called my mighty ones for [expressing] my anger, + my eminently exultant ones. 4 Listen! * A crowd in the mountains, something like a numerous people! + Listen! * The uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathered together! + Jehovah of armies is mustering the army of war. + 5 They are coming from the land far away, + from the extremity of the heavens, Jehovah and the weapons of his denunciation, to wreck all the earth. + 6 “Howl, YOU people, + for the day of Jehovah is near! + As a despoiling from the Almighty * it will come. + 7 That is why all hands themselves will drop down, and the whole heart itself of mortal man will melt. + 8 And people have become disturbed. + Convulsions and birth pains themselves grab hold; like a woman that is giving birth they have labor pains. + They look at each other in amazement. Their faces are inflamed faces. + 9 “Look! The day of Jehovah itself is coming, cruel both with fury and with burning anger, in order to make the land an object of astonishment, + and that it may annihilate [the land’s] * sinners out of it. + 10 For the very stars of the heavens and their constellations of Keʹsil * + will not flash forth their light; the sun will actually grow dark at its going forth, and the moon itself will not cause its light to shine. 11 And I shall certainly bring home [its own] badness upon the productive land, * + and their own error upon the wicked themselves. And I shall actually cause the pride of the presumptuous ones to cease, and the haughtiness of the tyrants * I shall abase. + 12 I shall make mortal man rarer than refined gold, * + and earthling man [rarer] than the gold * of Oʹphir. + 13 That is why I shall cause heaven itself to become agitated, + and the earth will rock out of its place at the fury of Jehovah of armies + and at the day of his burning anger. + 14 And it must occur that, like a gazelle chased away and like a flock without anyone to collect them together, + they will turn, each one to his own people; and they will flee, each one to his own land. + 15 Every one that is found will be pierced through, and every one that is caught in the sweep will fall by the sword; + 16 and their very children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes. + Their houses will be pillaged, and their own wives will be raped. + 17 “Here I am arousing against them the Medes, + who account silver itself as nothing and who, as respects gold, take no delight in it. 18 And [their] bows will dash even young men to pieces. + And the fruitage of the belly they will not pity; + for sons their eye will not feel sorry. 19 And Babylon, the decoration of kingdoms, + the beauty of the pride of the Chal·deʹans, + must become as when God * overthrew Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah. + 20 She will never be inhabited, + nor will she reside for generation after generation. + And there the Arab will not pitch his tent, and no shepherds will let [their flocks] lie down there. 21 And there the haunters of waterless regions * will certainly lie down, and their houses must be filled with eagle owls. * + And there the ostriches * must reside, and goat-shaped demons * themselves will go skipping about there. + 22 And jackals must howl in her dwelling towers, + and the big snake will be in the palaces of exquisite delight. And the season for her is near to come, and her days themselves will not be postponed.” + Footnotes ^ Heb., Yeshaʽ·yaʹhu . ^ “Babylon,” LXXVg; 1QIs a MTSy, “Babel.” ^ Lit., “mountain swept bare.” ^ “Signal.” Heb., nes . ^ “To my sanctified ones ,” that is, sanctified for Jehovah’s war.
