Lengthen out your tent cords, and make those tent pins of yours strong. + 3 For to the right and to the left you will break forth, + and your own offspring * will take possession even of nations, + and they will inhabit even the desolated cities. + 4 Do not be afraid, + for you will not be put to shame; + and do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disappointed. + For you will forget even the shame of your time of youth, + and the reproach of your continuous widowhood * you will remember no more.” 5 “For your Grand Maker * + is your husbandly owner, * + Jehovah of armies being his name; + and the Holy One of Israel is your Repurchaser. + The God of the whole earth * he will be called. + 6 For Jehovah called you as if you were a wife * left entirely and hurt in spirit, + and as a wife of the time of youth + who was then rejected,” + your God has said. 7 “For a little moment * I left you entirely, + but with great mercies I shall collect you together. + 8 With a flood of indignation I concealed my face from you for but a moment, + but with loving-kindness * to time indefinite I will have mercy upon you,” + your Repurchaser, + Jehovah, has said. 9 “This is just as the days of Noah to me. + Just as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth, + so I have sworn that I will not become indignant toward you nor rebuke you. + 10 For the mountains themselves may be removed, and the very hills may stagger, + but my loving-kindness itself will not be removed from you, + nor will my covenant of peace itself stagger,” + Jehovah, the One having mercy upon you, + has said. 11 “O woman afflicted, + tempest-tossed, + uncomforted, + here I am laying with hard mortar your stones, + and I will lay your foundation + with sapphires. + 12 And I will make your battlements of rubies, and your gates of fiery glowing stones, + and all your boundaries of delightsome stones. 13 And all your sons + will be persons taught * by Jehovah, + and the peace of your sons will be abundant. + 14 You will prove to be firmly established in righteousness itself. + You will be far away * from oppression + —for you will fear none—and from anything terrifying, for it will not come near you. + 15 If anyone should at all make an attack, it will not be at my orders. + Whoever is making an attack upon you will fall even on account of you.” + 16 “Look! I myself have created the craftsman, the one blowing + upon the fire of charcoal + and bringing forth a weapon as his workmanship. I myself, too, have created the ruinous man + for wrecking work. 17 Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success, + and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn. * + This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah, + and their righteousness is from me,” is the utterance of Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ “Let them stretch out,” M; 1QIs a , “let her stretch out”; LXXSyVg, “stretch out.” ^ “Grand tabernacle.” Lit., “tabernacles,” pl., evidently to denote grandeur. ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ “Your continuous widowhood.” Lit., “your widowhoods,” pl. to show prolongation. ^ “The God of the whole earth .” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ khol-ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ “Husbandly owner,” pl. in M to denote grandeur or excellence in agreement with “Grand Maker.” ^ “Grand Maker.” Lit., “Makers,” pl. to denote grandeur or excellence. ^ Or, “as if you were a woman .” Heb., khe ʼish·shahʹ . ^ “For a little moment,” MLXXVg; TSy, “With a little anger.” ^ Or, “but with loyal love .” Heb., u·ve cheʹsedh . ^ Or, “be disciples.” Compare 8:16 ftn, “Disciples.” ^ Lit., “Be far away!” Imperative. ^ Or, “you will pronounce wicked (guilty).” Previous Next Print Share Share
