All those seeing them will recognize them, + that they are the offspring whom Jehovah has blessed.” + 10 Without fail I shall exult in Jehovah. + My soul will be joyful in my God. + For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; + with the sleeveless coat of righteousness he has enwrapped me, + like the bridegroom who, in a priestly way, puts on a headdress, + and like the bride who decks herself with her ornamental things. + 11 For as the earth itself brings forth its sprout, and as the garden itself makes the things that are sown in it sprout, + in like manner the Sovereign Lord Jehovah * will cause the sprouting of righteousness + and of praise in front of all the nations. + Footnotes ^ Or, “release; manumission [of slaves].” ^ “On the part of our God .” Heb., l Eʼ·lo·h ehʹnu . ^ Lit., “sons of a foreign (country).” ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ “The ministers of.” Heb., meshor·thehʹ; Gr., lei·tour·goiʹ; Lat., mi·niʹstri . ^ “Along with unrighteousness,” by a slight change of vowel pointing of M in agreement with LXX and five Heb. mss; Sy, “and unrighteousness”; MVg, “in whole burnt offering.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ “The Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” Heb., ʼAdho·naiʹ Yehwihʹ; 1QIs a TSyVg, “Jehovah God”; LXX, “Jehovah.” See App 1E .
