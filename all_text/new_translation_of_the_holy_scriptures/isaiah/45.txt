I myself, Jehovah, have created it.” * + 9 Woe to the one that has contended with his Former, + as an earthenware fragment with the other earthenware fragments of the ground! Should the clay + say to its former: “What do you make?” And your achievement [say]: “He has no hands”? 10 Woe to the one saying to a father: “What do you become father to?” and to the wife: * “What are you in birth pains with?” + 11 This is what Jehovah has said, the Holy One of Israel + and the Former + of him: “Ask me even about the things that are coming + concerning my sons; + and concerning the activity + of my hands YOU people should command me. 12 I myself have made the earth + and have created even man * upon it. + I—my own hands have stretched out the heavens, + and all the army of them I have commanded.” + 13 “I myself have roused up someone in righteousness, + and all his ways I shall straighten out. + He is the one that will build my city, + and those of mine in exile he will let go, * + not for a price + nor for bribery,” Jehovah of armies has said. 14 This is what Jehovah has said: “The unpaid laborers of Egypt + and the merchants of E·thi·oʹpi·a * and the Sa·beʹans, + tall men, * + will themselves come over even to you, * and yours they will become. + Behind you they will walk; in fetters + they will come over, and to you they will bow down. + To you they will pray, [saying,] ‘Indeed God is in union with you, * + and there is no one else; there is no [other] God.’” * + 15 Truly you are a God keeping yourself concealed, + the God of Israel, a Savior. + 16 They will certainly be ashamed and even be humiliated, all of them. Together in humiliation + the manufacturers of [idol] forms will have to walk. 17 As for Israel, he will certainly be saved in union with Jehovah + with a salvation for times indefinite. + Y OU people will not be ashamed, + nor will YOU be humiliated + for the indefinite times of eternity. 18 For this is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of the heavens, + He the [true] God, + the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, + He the One who firmly established it, + who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited: + “I am Jehovah, and there is no one else. + 19 In a place of concealment I spoke not, + in a dark place of the earth; nor said I to the seed * of Jacob, ‘Seek me simply for nothing, YOU people.’ + I am Jehovah, speaking what is righteous, telling what is upright. + 20 “Collect yourselves and come. + Bring yourselves up close together, YOU escapees from the nations. + Those carrying the wood * of their carved image have not come to any knowledge, neither have those praying to a god that cannot save. * + 21 Make YOUR report and YOUR presentation. + Yes, let them consult together in unity. Who has caused this to be heard from a long time ago? + [Who] has reported it from that very time? + Is it not I, Jehovah, besides whom there is no other God; * + a righteous God * and a Savior, + there being none excepting me? + 22 “Turn to me and be saved, + all YOU [at the] ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no one else. + 23 By my own self I have sworn + —out of my own mouth in righteousness the word has gone forth, + so that it will not return + —that to me every knee will bend down, + every tongue will swear, * + 24 saying, ‘Surely in Jehovah there are full righteousness and strength. + All those getting heated up against him will come straight to him and be ashamed. + 25 In Jehovah all the seed + of Israel will prove to be right + and will boast about themselves.’” + Footnotes ^ “To his anointed one .” Heb., li m·shi·ch ohʹ; Gr., khri·stoiʹ ; Syr., la m·shi·ch eh; Lat., chriʹsto . ^ “To Cyrus,” M(Heb., leKhohʹresh )TLXXVg. ^ “The God of.” Heb., ʼElo·hehʹ . ^ Or, “him,” masc. ^ Or, “woman.” ^ “And . . . man .” Heb., we ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “he will send away .” Heb., ye shal·leʹach . ^ “Ethiopia,” Vg; LXX, “Ethiopians”; MTSy, “Cush.” ^ Lit., “men of measure.” ^ “You,” fem., referring to a people or a city. ^ “God is in union with you.” Lit., “ in you [is] God.” Heb., ba kh ʼEl . ^ “No [other] God.” Heb., ʼeʹphes ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “offspring.” ^ Or, “tree of.” Heb., ʽets . ^ “A god that cannot save.” Heb., ʼel loʼ yoh·shiʹaʽ; Gr., the·ousʹ ; Lat., deʹum . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “A righteous God.” Heb., ʼEl-tsad·diqʹ; Lat., Deʹus iuʹstus . ^ “To me every knee will bend down, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God,” LXX.
