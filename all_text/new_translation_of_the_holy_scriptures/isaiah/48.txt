Before it could come in, I caused you to hear [it], + that you might not say, ‘My own idol has done them, and my own carved image and my own molten image have commanded them.’ + 6 You have heard. + Behold it all. + As for YOU people, will YOU not tell [it]? + I have made you hear new things from the present time, even things kept in reserve, * that you have not known. + 7 At the present time they must be created, and not from that time, even things that before today you have not heard, that you may not say, ‘Look! I have already known them.’ + 8 “Moreover, you have not heard, + neither have you known, nor from that time on has your ear been opened. For I well know that without fail you kept dealing treacherously, + and a ‘transgressor from the belly’ * you have been called. + 9 For the sake of my name I shall check my anger, + and for my praise I shall restrain myself toward you that there may be no cutting you off. + 10 Look! I have refined you, but not in [the form of] silver. + I have made choice of you in the smelting furnace of affliction. + 11 For my own sake, for my own sake I shall act, + for how could one let oneself be profaned? + And to no one else shall I give my own glory. + 12 “Listen to me, O Jacob, and you Israel my called one. I am the same One. + I am the first. + Moreover, I am the last. + 13 Moreover, my own hand laid the foundation of the earth, + and my own right hand extended out the heavens. + I am calling to them, that they may keep standing together. + 14 “Be collected together, all YOU people, and hear. + Who among them * has told these things? Jehovah himself has loved him. + He will do what is his delight upon Babylon, + and his own arm will be upon the Chal·deʹans. + 15 I—I myself have spoken. Moreover, I have called him. + I have brought him in, and there will be a making of his way successful. + 16 “Come near to me, YOU people. Hear this. From the start I have spoken in no place of concealment at all. + From the time of its occurring I have been there.” And now the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has sent me, even * his spirit. + 17 This is what Jehovah has said, your Repurchaser, + the Holy One of Israel: + “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit [yourself], + the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk. + 18 O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! + Then your peace would become just like a river, + and your righteousness like the waves of the sea. + 19 And your offspring would become just like the sand, and the descendants from your inward parts like the grains of it. + One’s name * would not be cut off or be annihilated from before me.” + 20 Go forth, YOU people, out of Babylon! + Run away from the Chal·deʹans. + Tell forth even with the sound of a joyful cry, cause this to be heard. + Make it to go forth to the extremity of the earth. + Say: “Jehovah has repurchased his servant Jacob. + 21 And they did not get thirsty + when he was making them walk even through devastated places. + Water out of the rock he caused to flow forth for them, and he proceeded to split a rock that the water might stream forth.” + 22 “There is no peace,” Jehovah has said, “for the wicked ones.” + Footnotes ^ “Bowels; inward parts,” by a correction of M; about 40 Heb. mss, “days.” ^ “And . . . of the God of.” Heb., u·v Eʼ·lo·hehʹ . ^ Or, “trueness.” ^ Or, “kept under safeguard.” ^ That is, from the mother’s womb. ^ “Them,” 1QIs a MTLXXVg; Sy and about 40 Heb. mss, “you.” ^ Or, “and.” ^ Or, “His name,” 1QIs a MTSyVg; LXX, “Your name.” Previous Next Print Share Share
