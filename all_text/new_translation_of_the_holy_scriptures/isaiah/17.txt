Damascus removed from being a city, and she has become a heap, a decaying ruin. + 2 The cities of A·roʹer + that have been left behind become mere places for droves, where they actually lie down, with no one to make [them] tremble. + 3 And the fortified city has been made to cease out of Eʹphra·im, + and the kingdom out of Damascus; + and those of Syria remaining over will become just like the glory of the sons of Israel,” is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. + 4 “And it must occur in that day that the glory of Jacob will become lowly, + and even the fatness of his flesh will be made lean. + 5 And it must occur that when the harvester * is gathering the standing grain and his own arm harvests the ears of grain, + he must even become like one gleaning ears of grain in the low plain of Rephʹa·im. + 6 And there must remain in it a gleaning as when there is a beating off of the olive tree: two [or] three ripe olives in the top of the branch; four [or] five on the fruit-bearing boughs thereof,” is the utterance of Jehovah the God of Israel. + 7 In that day earthling man * will look up to his Maker, and his own eyes will gaze at the Holy One of Israel himself. + 8 And he will not look to the altars, + the work of his hands; + and at what his fingers have made he will not gaze, either at the sacred poles * or at the incense stands. + 9 In that day his fortress cities will become like a place left entirely in the woodland, even the branch that they have left entirely on account of the sons of Israel; and it must become a desolate waste. + 10 For you * have forgotten + the God of your salvation; + and the Rock + of your fortress you have not remembered. That is why you plant pleasant plantations, and with the shoot of a stranger * you set it. 11 In the day you may carefully fence about the plantation of yours, and in the morning you may cause the seed of yours to sprout, [but] the harvest will certainly flee in the day of the disease * and incurable pain. + 12 Ha for the commotion of many peoples, who are boisterous as with the boisterousness of the seas! And for the noise of national groups, who make a din just like the noise of mighty waters! + 13 The national groups + themselves will make a din just like the noise of many waters. And He will certainly rebuke it, + and it must flee far away and be chased like the chaff of the mountains before a wind and like a thistle whirl before a storm wind. + 14 At evening time, why, look! there is sudden terror. Before morning—it is no more. + This is the share of those pillaging us, and the lot belonging to those plundering us. + Footnotes ^ “Harvester,” by a slight correction; M, “harvest.” ^ Or, “mankind.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “the Asherim.” ^ “You,” fem., referring to the city of God’s worship. ^ Or, “a strange [god].” ^ “Disease,” by a slight correction; M, “possession.” Previous Next Print Share Share
