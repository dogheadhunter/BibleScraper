Clear the way of the people. + Bank up, bank up the highway. Rid [it] of stones. + Raise up a signal * for the peoples. + 11 Look! Jehovah himself has caused [it] to be heard to the farthest part * of the earth: + “Say, YOU people, to the daughter of Zion, + ‘Look! Your salvation is coming. + Look! The reward he gives is with him, + and the wages he pays are before him.’” + 12 And men will certainly call them the holy people, + those repurchased by Jehovah; + and you yourself will be called Searched For, * a City Not Left Entirely. + Footnotes ^ “Your,” fem. sing. ^ “O woman,” inserted because “your” is fem. sing. and refers to “Jerusalem.” ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aʹyikh . ^ Or, “Owned by a Husband.” Or, “Beulah.” Heb., Beʽu·lahʹ . ^ “My Delight Is in Her.” Or, “Hephzibah.” Heb., Cheph·tsi-vahʹ . ^ “Your,” fem. sing., addressed to Zion, or Jerusalem. ^ Lit., “sons of a foreign (country).” ^ “Signal.” Heb., nes; Lat., siʹgnum . ^ See Jer 25:31, 33 ftns. ^ “Searched For.” Heb., Dheru·shahʹ, fem. sing.
