No stately form does he have, nor any splendor; + and when we shall see him, there is not the appearance so that we should desire him. + 3 He was despised and was avoided by men, * + a man meant for pains and for having acquaintance with sickness. + And there was as if the concealing of one’s face from us. * + He was despised, and we held him as of no account. + 4 Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; + and as for our pains, he bore them. + But we ourselves accounted him as plagued, + stricken by God * + and afflicted. * + 5 But he was being pierced + for our transgression; + he was being crushed for our errors. + The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, + and because of his wounds + there has been a healing for us. + 6 Like sheep * we have all of us wandered about; + it was each one to his own way that we have turned; and Jehovah himself has caused the error of us all to meet up with that one. + 7 He was hard pressed, + and he was letting himself be afflicted; + yet he would not open his mouth. He was being brought just like a sheep * to the slaughtering; + and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth. + 8 Because of restraint * and of judgment he was taken away; * + and who will concern himself even with [the details of] his generation? * + For he was severed + from the land of the living ones. + Because of the transgression + of my people he had the stroke. * + 9 And he * will make * his burial place even with the wicked ones, + and with the rich class * in his death, + despite the fact that he had done no violence + and there was no deception in his mouth. + 10 But Jehovah himself took delight in crushing him; + he made him sick. + If you will set his soul * as a guilt offering, + he will see his offspring, + he will prolong [his] days, + and in his hand what is the delight + of Jehovah will succeed. + 11 Because of the trouble of his soul he will see, * + he will be satisfied. + By means of his knowledge * the righteous one, my servant, + will bring a righteous standing to many people; + and their errors he himself will bear. + 12 For that reason I shall deal him a portion among the many, + and it will be with the mighty ones that he will apportion the spoil, + due to the fact that he poured out his soul to the very death, + and it was with the transgressors that he was counted in; + and he himself carried the very sin of many people, + and for the transgressors he proceeded to interpose. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the report.” ^ Or, “him.” ^ Or, “him.” ^ “Men.” Heb., ʼi·shimʹ, pl. of ʼish, “man,” in this same vs. This pl. form occurs only here, and in Ps 141:4 and Pr 8:4 . ^ Or, “humbled.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “Like a flock .” Heb., kats· tsoʼnʹ . ^ Or, “like a lamb .” Heb., kas· sehʹ . ^ “He came to be stricken to the death,” by a correction of M in agreement with LXX. ^ Or, “[the details of] his manner of life.” ^ “He was taken from oppression and from judgment,” Vg; LXX, “During his humiliation the judgment was taken away from him.” See Ac 8:33 . ^ Or, “oppression; coercion.” ^ Or, “one.” ^ Lit., “give; furnish.” ^ Lit., “a rich one (man).” ^ “His soul .” Heb., naph·sh ohʹ; Gr., psy·kheʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam .
