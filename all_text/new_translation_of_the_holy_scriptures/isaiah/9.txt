The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this. + 8 There was a word that Jehovah * sent against Jacob, and it fell upon Israel. + 9 And the people will certainly know [it], + even all of them, Eʹphra·im and the inhabitant of Sa·marʹi·a, + because of [their] haughtiness and because of [their] insolence of heart in saying: + 10 “Bricks are what have fallen, but with hewn stone + we shall build. Sycamore + trees are what have been cut down, but with cedars we shall make replacement.” 11 And Jehovah will set the adversaries of Reʹzin on high against him, and the enemies of that one he will goad on, + 12 Syria from the east + and the Phi·lisʹtines from behind, + and they will eat up Israel with open mouth. + In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still. + 13 And the people themselves have not returned to the One striking them, + and Jehovah of armies they have not sought. + 14 And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head + and tail, + shoot and rush, in one day. + 15 The aged and highly respected one * is the head, + and the prophet giving false instruction is the tail. + 16 And those who are leading this people on prove to be the ones causing [them] to wander; + and those of them who are being led on, the ones who are being confused. + 17 That is why Jehovah * will not rejoice even over their young men, + and upon their fatherless boys and upon their widows he will have no mercy; because all of them are apostates + and evildoers and every mouth is speaking senselessness. In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still. + 18 For wickedness has become aflame just like a fire; + thornbushes and weeds it will eat up. + And it will catch fire in the thickets of the forest, + and they will be borne aloft as the billowing of smoke. + 19 In the fury of Jehovah of armies the land has been set afire, * and the people will become as food for the fire. + No one will show compassion even on his brother. + 20 And one will cut down on the right and will certainly be hungry; and one will eat on the left, and they will certainly not be satisfied. + They will each one eat the flesh of his own arm, + 21 Ma·nasʹseh Eʹphra·im, and Eʹphra·im Ma·nasʹseh. Together they will be against Judah. + In view of all this his anger has not turned back, but his hand is stretched out still. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “it,” fem., that is, the land or earth. ^ Or, “the circuit.” Heb., Gelilʹ; Syr., Geli·lo; Gr., Ga·li·laiʹa; Lat., Ga·li·leʹae . “Galilee” later designated the Roman province north of Samaria. ^ MLXX end chapter 8 here with this as vs 23. ^ “For it,” M margin TSy and about 20 Heb. mss. ^ Or, “rattling; pounding.” ^ Lit., “bloods.” ^ Or, “the princedom ; the rule as prince .” Heb., ham· mis·rahʹ ; Gr., he ar·kheʹ ; Lat., prin·ci·paʹtus . ^ Or, “Peaceable Prince,” that is, a prince giving peace. ^ Or, “Father Forever.” Heb., ʼAvi·ʽadhʹ . ^ Or, “Mighty Divine One.” Heb., ʼEl Gib·bohrʹ (not ʼEl Shad·daiʹ as in Ge 17:1 , where see ftn); Sy, “Mighty God of times indefinite”; Lat., Deʹus forʹtis . ^ Lit., “Wonder (Miracle) of a Counselor,” or, “Wonder, Counselor,” M; LXX, “The Angel of Grand Counsel”; Sy, “Wonder and Counselor.” ^ “The princely rule .” Heb., ham· mis·rahʹ .
