Come, buy and eat. + Yes, come, buy wine + and milk + even without money and without price. + 2 Why do YOU people keep paying out money for what is not bread, and why is YOUR toil for what results in no satisfaction? + Listen intently to me, and eat what is good, + and let YOUR soul find its exquisite delight in fatness itself. + 3 Incline YOUR ear + and come to me. + Listen, and YOUR soul will keep alive, + and I shall readily conclude with YOU people an indefinitely lasting covenant + respecting the loving-kindnesses * to David that are faithful. * + 4 Look! As a witness + to the national groups * + I have given him, + as a leader + and commander + to the national groups. 5 Look! A nation that you * do not know you will call, + and those of a nation who have not known you will run even to you, + for the sake of Jehovah your God, * + and for the Holy One of Israel, + because he will have beautified you. + 6 Search for Jehovah, YOU people, while he may be found. + Call to him while he proves to be near. + 7 Let the wicked man leave his way, + and the harmful man his thoughts; + and let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy upon him, + and to our God, for he will forgive in a large way. + 8 “For the thoughts of YOU people are not my thoughts, + nor are my ways YOUR ways,” + is the utterance of Jehovah. 9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, + so my ways are higher than YOUR ways, + and my thoughts than YOUR thoughts. + 10 For just as the pouring rain descends, and the snow, from the heavens and does not return to that place, unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout, + and seed is actually given to the sower and bread to the eater, + 11 so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. + It will not return to me without results, + but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, + and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it. + 12 “For with rejoicing YOU people will go forth, + and with peace YOU will be brought in. + The mountains and the hills themselves will become cheerful before YOU with a joyful outcry, + and the very trees of the field will all clap their hands. + 13 Instead of the thicket of thorns the juniper tree will come up. + Instead of the stinging nettle the myrtle tree will come up. + And it must become for Jehovah something famous, * + a sign to time indefinite + that will not be cut off.” Footnotes ^ Or, “lasting; firmly established.” ^ Or, “the full loving-kindness; the full loyal love.” ^ Or, “the populations; the masses.” LXX, “nations.” ^ “You,” masc. sing., referring to Jacob, or Israel. ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ Or, “a fame; a reputation.” Lit., “a name.” Previous Next Print Share Share
