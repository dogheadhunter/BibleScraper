Put on your beautiful garments, + O Jerusalem, the holy city! + For no more will there come again into you the uncircumcised and unclean one. + 2 Shake yourself free from the dust, + rise up, take a seat, O Jerusalem. Loosen for yourself the bands on your neck, O captive daughter of Zion. + 3 For this is what Jehovah has said: “It was for nothing that YOU people were sold, + and it will be without money that YOU will be repurchased.” + 4 For this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “It was to Egypt that my people went down in the first instance to reside there as aliens; + and without cause As·syrʹi·a, for its part, oppressed them.” 5 “And now, what interest do I have here?” is the utterance of Jehovah. “For my people were taken for nothing. + The very ones ruling over them kept howling,” * + is the utterance of Jehovah, “and constantly, all day long, my name was being treated with disrespect. + 6 For that reason my people will know my name, + even for that reason in that day, because I am the One that is speaking. + Look! It is I.” 7 How comely upon the mountains are the feet + of the one bringing good news, + the one publishing peace, + the one bringing good news of something better, + the one publishing salvation, + the one saying to Zion: “Your God * has become king!” + 8 Listen! * Your * own watchmen + have raised [their] voice. + In unison they keep crying out joyfully; for it will be eye into eye + that they will see when Jehovah gathers back Zion. + 9 Become cheerful, cry out joyfully in unison, YOU devastated places of Jerusalem, + for Jehovah has comforted his people; + he has repurchased Jerusalem. + 10 Jehovah has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; + and all the ends of the earth must see the salvation of our God. + 11 Turn away, turn away, get out of there, + touch nothing unclean; + get out from the midst of her, + keep yourselves clean, YOU who are carrying the utensils of Jehovah. + 12 For YOU people will get out in no panic, and YOU will go in no flight. + For Jehovah will be going even before YOU , + and the God of Israel will be YOUR rear guard. * + 13 Look! My servant + will act with insight. + He will be in high station and will certainly be elevated and exalted very much. + 14 To the extent that many have stared at him * in amazement + —so much was the disfigurement as respects his appearance + more than that of any other man * and as respects his stately form + more than that of the sons of mankind * — 15 he will likewise startle many nations. + At him kings will shut their mouth, + because what had not been recounted to them they will actually see, and to what they had not heard they must turn their consideration. + Footnotes ^ Or, “kept making [them] howl.” ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h aʹyikh . ^ Lit., “The voice of.” ^ “Your,” fem. sing., referring to “Zion.” ^ “Be your rear guard.” Lit., “be gathering you up.” ^ “Him,” TSy; 1QIs a MLXXVg, “you.” ^ “Than . . . man .” Heb., me· ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ .
