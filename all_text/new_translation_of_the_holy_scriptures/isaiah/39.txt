There proved to be nothing that Hez·e·kiʹah did not show them in his own house + and in all his dominion. + 3 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hez·e·kiʹah and said to him: + “What did these men say, and from where did they proceed to come to you?” So Hez·e·kiʹah said: “From a distant land they came to me, from Babylon.” + 4 And he went on to say: “What did they see in your house?” + To this Hez·e·kiʹah said: “Everything that is in my house they saw. There proved to be nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.” 5 Isaiah now said to Hez·e·kiʹah: + “Hear the word of Jehovah of armies, 6 ‘Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon.’ + ‘Nothing will be left,’ + Jehovah has said. 7 ‘And some of your own sons that will come forth from you, to whom you will become father, will themselves be taken + and actually become court officials + in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” + 8 At that Hez·e·kiʹah said to Isaiah: “The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good.” + And he went on to say: “Because peace and truth + will continue in my own days.” + Footnotes ^ “Babylon,” Vg; LXX, “Babylonia”; MTSy, “Babel.” Previous Next Print Share Share
