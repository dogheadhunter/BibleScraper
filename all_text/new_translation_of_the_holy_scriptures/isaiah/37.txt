You yourself have heard what the kings of As·syrʹi·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction, + and will you yourself be delivered? + 12 Have the gods + of the nations that my forefathers brought to ruin delivered them, + even Goʹzan + and Haʹran + and Reʹzeph and the sons of Eʹden + that were in Tel-asʹsar? 13 Where is the king of Haʹmath + and the king of Arʹpad + and the king of the city of Seph·ar·vaʹim + —of Heʹna and of Ivʹvah?’” + 14 Then Hez·e·kiʹah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them, + after which Hez·e·kiʹah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it out before Jehovah. + 15 And Hez·e·kiʹah began to pray to Jehovah, + saying: 16 “O Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, + sitting upon the cherubs, you alone are the [true] God of all the kingdoms of the earth. + You yourself have made the heavens and the earth. + 17 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear. + Open your eyes, + O Jehovah, and see, and hear all the words of Sen·nachʹer·ib + that he has sent to taunt the living God. * + 18 It is a fact, O Jehovah, that the kings of As·syrʹi·a have devastated all the lands, and their own land. + 19 And there was a consigning of their gods to the fire, + because they were no gods, * + but the workmanship of man’s hands, + wood and stone, so that they destroyed them. + 20 And now, O Jehovah our God, + save us out of his hand, + that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are [God] * alone.” + 21 And Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz proceeded to send to Hez·e·kiʹah, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning Sen·nachʹer·ib the king of As·syrʹi·a, + 22 this is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him: “The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you, she has held you in derision. + Behind you the daughter of Jerusalem has wagged [her] head. + 23 Whom have you taunted + and spoken of abusively? + And against whom have you lifted up [your] voice + And do you raise your eyes on high? + It is against the Holy One of Israel! + 24 By means of your servants you have taunted Jehovah * and you say, + ‘With the multitude of my war chariots I myself + — I shall certainly ascend the height of mountainous regions, + The remotest parts of Lebʹa·non; + And I shall cut down its lofty cedars, its choice juniper trees. + And I shall enter its final height, * the forest of its orchard. + 25 I myself shall certainly dig and drink waters, And I shall dry up with the soles of my feet all the Nile + canals of Egypt.’ * + 26 Have you not heard? + From remote times it is what I will do. + From bygone days I have even formed it. + Now I will bring it in. + And you will serve to make fortified cities become desolate as piles of ruins. + 27 And their inhabitants will be feeble-handed; + They will simply be terrified and ashamed. + They must become as vegetation of the field and green tender grass, + Grass of the roofs + and of the terrace before the east wind. + 28 And your sitting quiet * and your going out + and your coming in I well know, + And your exciting yourself against me, + 29 Because your exciting yourself against me + and your roaring have come up into my ears. + And I shall certainly put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lips, + And I shall indeed lead you back by the way by which you have come.” + 30 “‘And this will be the sign for you: There will be an eating this year of the growth from spilled kernels, + and in the second year grain that shoots up of itself; but in the third year sow seed, YOU people, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. + 31 And those who escape of the house of Judah, those who are left remaining, + will certainly take root downward and produce fruitage upward. + 32 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth + and those who escape out of Mount Zion. + The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this. + 33 “‘Therefore this is what Jehovah has said concerning the king of As·syrʹi·a: + “He will not come into this city, + nor will he shoot an arrow there, nor confront it with a shield, nor cast up a siege rampart against it.”’ + 34 “‘By the way by which he came he will return, and into this city he will not come,’ is the utterance of Jehovah. + 35 ‘And I shall certainly defend + this city to save it for my own sake + and for the sake of David my servant.’” + 36 And the angel + of Jehovah proceeded to go forth and strike down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the As·syrʹi·ans. + When people rose up early in the morning, why, there all of them were dead carcasses. + 37 Hence Sen·nachʹer·ib + the king of As·syrʹi·a pulled away and went and returned + and took up dwelling in Ninʹe·veh. + 38 And it came about that as he was bowing down at the house of Nisʹroch + his god, * + A·dramʹme·lech and Shar·eʹzer, his own sons, struck him down with the sword, + and they themselves escaped to the land of Arʹa·rat. * + And Eʹsar-hadʹdon + his son began to reign in place of him.
