Bring my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremity of the earth, + 7 everyone that is called by my name + and that I have created for my own glory, + that I have formed, yes, that I have made.’ + 8 “Bring forth a people blind though eyes themselves exist, and the ones deaf though they have ears. + 9 Let the nations all be collected together * at one place, and let national groups be gathered together. + Who is there among them that can tell this? + Or can they cause us to hear even the first things? + Let them furnish their witnesses, + that they may be declared righteous, or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’” * + 10 “Y OU are my witnesses,” * + is the utterance of Jehovah, “even my servant * whom I have chosen, + in order that YOU may know + and have faith in me, + and that YOU may understand that I am the same One. + Before me there was no God * formed, + and after me there continued to be none. * + 11 I—I am Jehovah, + and besides me there is no savior.” + 12 “I myself have told forth and have saved and have caused [it] to be heard, + when there was among YOU no strange [god]. * + So YOU are my witnesses,” + is the utterance of Jehovah, “and I am God. * + 13 Also, all the time * I am the same One; + and there is no one effecting deliverance out of my own hand. + I shall get active, + and who can turn it * back?” + 14 This is what Jehovah has said, the Repurchaser of YOU people, + the Holy One of Israel: + “For YOUR sakes I will send to Babylon and cause the bars of the prisons * to come down, + and the Chal·deʹans in the ships with whining cries on their part. + 15 I am Jehovah YOUR Holy One, * + the Creator of Israel, + YOUR King.” + 16 This is what Jehovah has said, the One making a way through the sea itself and a roadway even through strong waters, + 17 the One bringing forth the war chariot and the horse, the military force and the strong ones * at the same time: + “They will lie down. + They will not get up. + They will certainly be extinguished. + Like a flaxen wick they must be put out.” + 18 “Do not remember the first things, and to the former things do not turn YOUR consideration. 19 Look! I am doing something new. + Now it will spring up. Y OU people will know it, will YOU not? + Really, through the wilderness I shall set a way, + through the desert rivers. + 20 The wild beast of the field will glorify me, + the jackals and the ostriches; * + because I shall have given water even in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, + to cause my people, my chosen one, + to drink, 21 the people whom I have formed for myself, that they should recount the praise of me. + 22 “But you have not called even me, O Jacob, + because you have grown weary of me, O Israel. + 23 You have not brought me the sheep of your whole burnt offerings, and with your sacrifices you have not glorified me. + I have not compelled you to serve me with a gift, nor have I made you weary with frankincense. + 24 For me you have bought no [sweet] cane + with any money; * and with the fat of your sacrifices you have not saturated me. + In reality you have compelled me to serve because of your sins; you have made me weary with your errors. + 25 “I—I am the One that is wiping + out your transgressions + for my own sake, + and your sins I shall not remember. + 26 Remind me; let us put ourselves on judgment * together; + tell your own account of it in order that you may be in the right. + 27 Your own father, the first one, has sinned, + and your own spokesmen * have transgressed against me. + 28 So I shall profane the princes of the holy place, * and I will give Jacob over as a man devoted to destruction and Israel over to words of abuse. + Footnotes ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ Or, “ atonement price for you.” Lit., “your covering .” Heb., khoph·r ekhaʹ . ^ “Ethiopia,” LXXVg; MTSy, “Cush.” ^ Lit., “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “and toward Teman .” Heb., u·le theh·manʹ . ^ In agreement with TSy; MLXX, “All the nations have collected themselves together.” ^ “It is the truth!” Lit., “Truth!” Heb., ʼemethʹ . ^ “You are my witnesses .” Heb., ʼat·temʹ ʽe·dh aiʹ, pl.; Lat., vos teʹstes meʹi . ^ “Even my servant ,” M(Heb., we ʽav·d iʹ, sing.)LXXVg; T(Aram.), we ·ʽav·dh iʹ me·shi·ch aʼʹ, “even my servant , the anointed ”; Sy, “servants.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “and after me there came [or, will come] to be none.” ^ Or, “no stranger.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Lit., “from [the] day.” LXXVg, “from the beginning.” ^ “It,” fem., referring to “hand,” fem. ^ “The bars of the prisons,” by a correction; M, “the bars, all of them”; Vg, “all the bars (barriers).” ^ Or, “I, Jehovah, am your Holy One .” Heb., ʼaniʹ Yehwahʹ Qedho·sh ekhemʹ . ^ Lit., “and the strong one,” sing. but in a collective sense. ^ Lit., “daughters of an ostrich.” ^ Or, “silver.” ^ Or, “let us enter into controversy; let us plead.” ^ Or, “interpreters.” ^ Or, “profane the holy princes.” Previous Next Print Share Share
