Y OUR own God will come with vengeance + itself, God even with a repayment. + He himself will come and save YOU people.” + 5 At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, + and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. + 6 At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, + and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness. + For in the wilderness waters will have burst out, and torrents in the desert plain. 7 And the heat-parched ground will have become as a reedy pool, and the thirsty ground as springs of water. + In the abiding place of jackals, + a resting-place for [them], * there will be green grass with reeds and papyrus + plants. 8 And there will certainly come to be a highway + there, even a way; and the Way of Holiness * it will be called. + The unclean one will not pass over it. * + And it will be for the one walking on the way, and no foolish ones will wander about [on it]. * 9 No lion will prove to be there, and the rapacious sort of wild beasts will not come up on it. * + None will be found there; + and the repurchased ones must walk [there]. + 10 And the very ones redeemed by Jehovah will return + and certainly come to Zion with a joyful cry; + and rejoicing to time indefinite will be upon their head. + To exultation and rejoicing they will attain, and grief and sighing must flee away. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the Arabah.” ^ Or, “crocus; asphodel.” ^ “Our God .” Heb., ʼElo·h ehʹnu . ^ “Those,” MTSyVg; LXX, “my people.” ^ “It,” fem., referring to the “desert plain” in vs 1; 12 Heb. mss, “you.” ^ “It,” fem., referring to the “des­ert plain” in vs 1. ^ Or, “slack; drooping.” ^ Lit., “her,” possibly referring to a wild beast. ^ “And by no means will the unclean one pass along there; no unclean way will be there.
