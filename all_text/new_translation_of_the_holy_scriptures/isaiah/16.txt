The vine of Sibʹmah + —the owners * of the nations themselves have smitten down its bright-red [branches]. * As far as Jaʹzer + they had reached; they had wandered about in the wilderness. Its own shoots had been left to luxuriate for themselves; they had gone over to the sea. 9 That is why I shall weep with the weeping of Jaʹzer over the vine of Sibʹmah. + With my tears I shall drench you, O Heshʹbon + and E·le·aʹleh, + because shouting even over your summer and over your harvest has fallen down. * + 10 And rejoicing and joyfulness have been taken away from the orchard; and in the vineyards there is no joyful crying out, there is no shouting done. + No wine in the presses does the treader tread out. + Shouting I have caused to cease. + 11 That is why my very inwards are boisterous just like a harp even over Moʹab, + and the midst of me over Kir-harʹe·seth. * + 12 And it occurred that it was seen that Moʹab was made weary upon the high place; + and he came to his sanctuary to pray, + and he could not accomplish anything. + 13 This is the word that Jehovah spoke concerning Moʹab formerly. 14 And now Jehovah has spoken, saying: “Within three years, according to the years of a hired laborer, + the glory + of Moʹab must also be disgraced with much commotion of every sort, and those who remain over will be a trifling few, not mighty.” + Footnotes ^ “Bring in,” masc. pl. in 1QIs a M, but in M margin LXXVg and 11 Heb. mss it is fem. sing. ^ “Make,” fem. sing. ^ “The oppressor,” by a slight correction; M, “the squeezer.” ^ Or, “land.” ^ Or, “in loyal love .” Heb., ba· cheʹsedh . ^ Or, “in truth .” Heb., be· ʼemethʹ . ^ Or, “grand owner.” Heb., ba·ʽalehʹ, a pl. form of baʹʽal, possibly to express grandeur. ^ Or, “[grapes].” ^ Or, “because upon your summer fruit and upon your harvest the [battle] shout has fallen.” ^ “Over Kir-hareseth.” Heb., leQirʹ chaʹres .
