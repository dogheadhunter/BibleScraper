And he must strike the earth * with the rod of his mouth; + and with the spirit of his lips he will put the wicked one to death. + 5 And righteousness must prove to be the belt of his hips, + and faithfulness the belt of his loins. + 6 And the wolf will actually reside for a while with the male lamb, + and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the calf and the maned young lion + and the well-fed animal all together; + and a mere little boy will be leader over them. * 7 And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their young ones will lie down. And even the lion will eat straw just like the bull. + 8 And the sucking child will certainly play upon the hole of the cobra; + and upon the light aperture * of a poisonous snake will a weaned child actually put his own hand. 9 They will not do any harm + or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; + because the earth * will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea. * + 10 And it must occur in that day + that there will be the root of Jesʹse + that will be standing up as a signal * for the peoples. + To him even the nations will turn inquiringly, + and his resting-place must become glorious. + 11 And it must occur in that day that Jehovah * will again offer his hand, a second time, + to acquire the remnant * of his people who will remain over from As·syrʹi·a + and from Egypt + and from Pathʹros + and from Cush * + and from Eʹlam + and from Shiʹnar * + and from Haʹmath and from the islands of the sea. + 12 And he will certainly raise up a signal * for the nations and gather the dispersed ones of Israel; + and the scattered ones * of Judah he will collect together from the four extremities * of the earth. + 13 And the jealousy of Eʹphra·im must depart, + and even those showing hostility to Judah will be cut off. Eʹphra·im itself will not be jealous of Judah, nor will Judah show hostility toward Eʹphra·im. + 14 And they must fly at the shoulder of the Phi·lisʹtines to the west; * + together they will plunder the sons of the East. * + Eʹdom and Moʹab will be those upon whom they will thrust out their hand, + and the sons of Amʹmon will be their subjects. + 15 And Jehovah will certainly cut off * the tongue of the Egyptian sea, + and wave his hand at the River + in the glow * of his spirit. And he must strike it in [its] seven torrents, and he will actually cause people to walk in [their] sandals. + 16 And there must come to be a highway + out of As·syrʹi·a for the remnant + of his people who will remain over, + just as there came to be [one] for Israel in the day of his coming up out of the land of Egypt.
