Because of YOUR own errors + YOU have been sold, and because of YOUR own transgressions YOUR mother has been sent away. + 2 Why is it that, when I came in, there was no one? * + When I called, there was nobody answering? + Has my hand become in fact so short that it cannot redeem, + or is there in me no power to deliver? Look! With my rebuke + I dry up the sea; + I make rivers a wilderness. + Their fish stink due to there being no water, and they die because of thirst. + 3 I clothe the heavens with obscurity, + and I make sackcloth itself their covering.” + 4 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones, * + that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word. + He awakens morning by morning; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones. + 5 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has opened my ear, and I, for my part, was not rebellious. + I did not turn in the opposite direction. + 6 My back I gave to the strikers, and my cheeks + to those plucking off [the hair]. My face I did not conceal from humiliating things * and spit. + 7 But the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself will help me. + That is why I shall not have to feel humiliated. That is why I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed. + 8 The One declaring me righteous * is near. + Who can contend with me? Let us stand up together. + Who is my judicial antagonist? * + Let him approach me. + 9 Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself will help me. Who is there that can pronounce me wicked? * + Look! All of them, like a garment, will wear out. + A mere moth will eat them up. + 10 Who among YOU people is in fear + of Jehovah, listening to the voice of his servant, + who has walked in continual darkness + and for whom there has been no brightness? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah + and support himself upon his God. * + 11 “Look! All YOU who are igniting a fire, making sparks light up, * walk in the light of YOUR fire, and amid the sparks that YOU have set ablaze. From my hand YOU will certainly come to have this: In sheer pain YOU will lie down. + Footnotes ^ Or, “man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “the disciples (followers).” ^ Or, “from insults.” ^ Or, “pronouncing me innocent.” ^ “My judicial antagonist.” Lit., “the owner [Heb., vaʹʽal, from baʹʽal ] of my judgment.” ^ Or, “can condemn me?” ^ “Upon his God .” Heb., b Eʼ·lo·h avʹ . ^ By a correction; lit., “closely girding on the sparks (fiery arrows).” Previous Next Print Share Share
