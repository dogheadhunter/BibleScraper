Is it such a little thing for YOU to tire out men, that YOU should also tire out my God? + 14 Therefore Jehovah * himself will give YOU men a sign: Look! The maiden * + herself will actually become pregnant, + and she is giving birth to a son, + and she will certainly call his name Im·manʹu·el. * 15 Butter and honey he will eat by the time that he knows how to reject the bad and choose the good. + 16 For before the boy will know how to reject the bad and choose the good, + the ground of whose two kings you are feeling a sickening dread will be left entirely. + 17 Jehovah will bring against you + and against your people and against the house of your father days such as have not come since the day of Eʹphra·im’s turning away from alongside Judah, + namely, the king of As·syrʹi·a. * + 18 “And it must occur in that day that Jehovah will whistle for the flies * that are at the extremity of the Nile canals of Egypt and for the bees * + that are in the land of As·syrʹi·a, + 19 and they will certainly come in and settle down, all of them, upon the precipitous torrent valleys and upon the clefts of the crags and upon all the thorn thickets and upon all the watering places. * + 20 “In that day, by means of a hired razor in the region of the River, + even by means of the king of As·syrʹi·a, + Jehovah * will shave the head and the hair of the feet, * and it * will sweep away even the beard itself. + 21 “And it must occur in that day that an individual * will preserve alive a young cow of the herd and two sheep. + 22 And it must occur that, due to the abundance of the producing of milk, he will eat butter; because butter and honey + are what everyone left remaining in the midst of the land * will eat. 23 “And it must occur in that day that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand pieces of silver, + will come to be—for the thornbushes and for the weeds it will come to be. + 24 With arrows and the bow he * will come there, + because all the land will become mere thornbushes and weeds. 25 And all the mountains that used to be cleared of troublesome plants with a hoe—you will not come there for fear of thornbushes and weeds; and it will certainly become a place for letting bulls loose and a trampling ground of sheep.” + Footnotes ^ See 2Ki 15:25 ftn, “Remaliah.” ^ “He,” MT; 1QIs a LXXSyVg and 2Ki 16:5 , “they.” ^ “Has settled down; has rested,” by another derivation of the Heb. verb. ^ Or, “a blast.” Heb., ruʹach .
