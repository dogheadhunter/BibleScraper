Into YOUR hand they are now given. + 3 Every moving animal that is alive may serve as food for YOU . + As in the case of green vegetation, I do give it all to YOU . + 4 Only flesh with its soul * + —its blood + — YOU must not eat. + 5 And, besides that, YOUR blood of YOUR souls * shall I ask back. From the hand of every living creature shall I ask it back; and from the hand of man, * from the hand of each one * who is his brother, shall I ask back the soul * of man. + 6 Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, + for in God’s image he made man. 7 And as for YOU men, be fruitful and become many, make the earth swarm with YOU and become many in it.” + 8 And God went on to say to Noah and to his sons with him: 9 “And as for me, here I am establishing my covenant + with YOU men and with YOUR offspring * after YOU , + 10 and with every living soul that is with YOU , among fowls, among beasts and among all living creatures of the earth with YOU , from all those going out of the ark to every living creature of the earth. + 11 Yes, I do establish my covenant with YOU : No more will all flesh be cut off by waters of a deluge, and no more will there occur a deluge to bring the earth to ruin.” + 12 And God added: “This is the sign + of the covenant that I am giving between me and YOU and every living soul that is with YOU , for the generations to time indefinite. 13 My rainbow + I do give * in the cloud, and it must serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. 14 And it shall occur that when I bring a cloud over the earth, then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud. 15 And I shall certainly remember my covenant + which is between me and YOU and every living soul among all flesh; + and no more will the waters become a deluge to bring all flesh to ruin. + 16 And the rainbow must occur in the cloud, + and I shall certainly see it to remember the covenant to time indefinite + between God and every living soul among all flesh that is upon the earth.” + 17 And God repeated to Noah: “This is the sign of the covenant that I do establish between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.” + 18 And Noah’s sons + who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Jaʹpheth. Later Ham was the father of Caʹnaan. + 19 These three were Noah’s sons, and from these was all the earth’s population * spread abroad. + 20 Now Noah started off as a farmer * + and proceeded to plant a vineyard. + 21 And he began drinking of the wine and became intoxicated, + and so he uncovered himself in the midst of his tent. 22 Later Ham + the father of Caʹnaan saw his father’s nakedness + and went telling it to his two brothers outside. + 23 At that Shem and Jaʹpheth took a * mantle + and put it upon both their shoulders and walked in backwards. Thus they covered their father’s nakedness, while their faces were turned away, * and they did not see their father’s nakedness. + 24 Finally Noah awoke from his wine and got to know what his youngest son had done to him. 25 At this he said: “Cursed be Caʹnaan. + Let him become the lowest slave * to his brothers.” + 26 And he added: “Blessed be Jehovah, * + Shem’s God, And let Caʹnaan become a slave * to him. + 27 Let God grant ample space to Jaʹpheth, And let him reside * in the tents of Shem. + Let Caʹnaan become a slave to him also.” 28 And Noah continued to live three hundred and fifty years after the deluge. + 29 So all the days of Noah amounted to nine hundred and fifty years and he died. + Footnotes ^ Or, “life.” See 1:30 ftn. ^ Or, “lives.” ^ Or, “mankind.” Heb., ha·ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “a man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Heb., neʹphesh, as in 2:7 ; Gr., psy·khenʹ . ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or, “I will certainly give.” ^ Lit., “all the earth.” ^ Lit., “a man of the soil.” ^ Lit., “were backward.” ^ Lit., “the.” ^ Lit., “the slave of slaves.” ^ Heb., Yeho·wahʹ .
