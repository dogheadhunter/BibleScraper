Noah was a righteous man. + He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. * Noah walked with the [true] God. + 10 In time Noah became father to three sons, Shem, Ham and Jaʹpheth. + 11 And the earth came to be ruined in the sight of the [true] God + and the earth became filled with violence. + 12 So God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, + because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth. + 13 After that God said to Noah: “The end of all flesh has come before me, + because the earth is full of violence as a result of them; and here I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth. + 14 Make for yourself an ark * out of wood of a resinous tree. * + You will make compartments * in the ark, and you must cover it inside and outside with tar. + 15 And this is how you will make it: three hundred cubits * + the length of the ark, fifty cubits its width, and thirty cubits its height. 16 You will make a tsoʹhar [roof; or, window] * for the ark, and you will complete it to the extent of a cubit upward, * and the entrance of the ark you will put in its side; + you will make it with a lower [story], a second [story] and a third [story]. 17 “And as for me, here I am bringing the deluge * + of waters upon the earth to bring to ruin all flesh in which the force of life + is active * from under the heavens. Everything that is in the earth will expire. + 18 And I do establish my covenant with you; and you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. + 19 And of every living creature of every sort of flesh, + two of each, you will bring into the ark to preserve them alive with you. + Male and female they will be. 20 Of the flying creatures according to their kinds and of the domestic animals according to their kinds, + of all moving animals of the ground according to their kinds, * two of each will go in there to you to preserve them alive. + 21 And as for you, take for yourself every sort of food that is eaten; + and you must gather it to yourself, and it must serve as food for you and for them.” + 22 And Noah proceeded to do according to all that God had commanded him. He did just so. + Footnotes ^ “Angels,” LXX A . ^ “He,” referring to “man,” and not to “my spirit.” ^ Or, “The Fellers.” Heb., han·Nephi·limʹ, “those who cause others to fall down.” ^ “The mighty ones .” Heb., hag· gib·bo·rimʹ . ^ Lit., “name.” ^ Lit., “day.” ^ “Among his contemporaries .” Lit., “among his generations .” Heb., be dho·ro·th avʹ . ^ Lit., “a chest.” Heb., te·vathʹ .
