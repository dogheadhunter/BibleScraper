If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, + then you must take my gift at my hand, because in harmony with its purpose I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face in that you received me with pleasure. + 11 Take, please, the gift conveying my blessing which was brought to you, + because God has favored me and because I have everything.” + And he continued to urge him, so that he took it. + 12 Later on he said: “Let us pull out and go, and let me go in advance of you.” 13 But he said to him: “My lord is aware that the children are delicate and sheep and cattle that are giving suck are in my charge, + and should they drive them too quickly for one day, then the whole flock will certainly die. + 14 Let my lord, please, pass on ahead of his servant, but may I myself continue the journey at my leisure according to the pace of the livestock + that is before me and according to the pace of the children + until I shall come to my lord at Seʹir.” + 15 Then Eʹsau said: “Let me, please, put at your disposal some of the people who are with me.” To this he said: “Why this? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” + 16 So on that day Eʹsau turned back on his way to Seʹir. 17 And Jacob pulled out for Sucʹcoth, * + and he proceeded to build himself a house and for his herd he made booths. + That was why he called the name of the place Sucʹcoth. 18 In time Jacob came safe and sound to the city of Sheʹchem, + which is in the land of Caʹnaan, + while he was coming from Padʹdan-aʹram; + and he pitched camp in front of the city. 19 Then he acquired a tract of the field where he pitched his tent at the hand of the sons of Haʹmor the father of Sheʹchem, for a hundred pieces of money. * + 20 After that he set up there an altar and called it God the God of Israel. * + Footnotes ^ “And kiss him,” MSamLXX Bagster Vg. In M this expression is marked with extraordinary points by the Sopherim, evidently to show that the Sopherim thought the words should be omitted. The ftns of BHK and BHS suggest that they were likely added to the text.
