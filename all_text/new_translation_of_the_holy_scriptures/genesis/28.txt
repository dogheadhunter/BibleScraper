So he took one of the stones of the place and set it as his head supporter * and lay down in that place. + 12 And he began to dream, + and, look! there was a ladder * stationed upon the earth and its top reaching up to the heavens; and, look! there were God’s angels ascending and descending on it. + 13 And, look! there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he proceeded to say: + “I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. + The land upon which you are lying, to you I am going to give it and to your seed. + 14 And your seed will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, + and you will certainly spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, + and by means of you and by means of your seed all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves. * + 15 And here I am with you and I will keep you in all the way you are going and I will return you to this ground, + because I am not going to leave you until I have actually done what I have spoken to you.” + 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said: “Truly Jehovah is in this place and I myself did not know it.” 17 And he grew fearful and added: + “How fear-inspiring this place is! + This is nothing else but the house of God + and this is the gate of the heavens.” 18 So Jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone that was there as his head supporter and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. + 19 Further, he called the name of that place Bethʹel; * + but the fact is, Luz was the city’s name formerly. + 20 And Jacob went on to vow a vow, + saying: “If God will continue with me and will certainly keep me on this way on which I am going and will certainly give me bread to eat and garments to wear + 21 and I shall certainly return in peace to the house of my father, then Jehovah will have proved to be my God. * + 22 And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God, + and as for everything that you will give me I shall without fail give the tenth of it to you.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the Canaanites.” ^ See 25:20 ftn, “Paddan-aram.” ^ “Jacob and Esau.” Jacob is put before his older twin brother, Esau, denoting preference. ^ Lit., “the Aramaean.” ^ Or, “bad; evil.” ^ Or, “the Ishmaelites.” By now Ishmael himself was dead and Esau was about 77 years old. See 25:17, 26 . ^ Or, “his pillow.” ^ Or, “rising flight of stones.” ^ “Will be blessed,” LXXVg. See 22:18 ftn. ^ Meaning “House of God.” Heb., Behth-ʼElʹ . ^ Or, “God to me.” Heb., li lEʼ·lo·himʹ .
