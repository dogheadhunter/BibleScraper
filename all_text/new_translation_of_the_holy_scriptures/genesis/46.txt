And the sons of Be·riʹah were Heʹber and Malʹchi·el. + 18 These are the sons of Zilʹpah, + whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. In time she bore these to Jacob: sixteen souls. 19 The sons of Rachel, + Jacob’s wife, were Joseph + and Benjamin. + 20 And there came to be born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nasʹseh + and Eʹphra·im, * + whom Asʹe·nath + the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On bore to him. 21 And the sons of Benjamin were Beʹla + and Beʹcher + and Ashʹbel, Geʹra + and Naʹa·man, + Eʹhi and Rosh, Mupʹpim + and Hupʹpim + and Ard. 22 These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob. All the souls were fourteen. 23 And the sons of Dan + were Huʹshim. + 24 And the sons of Naphʹta·li + were Jahʹze·el and Guʹni + and Jeʹzer and Shilʹlem. + 25 These are the sons of Bilʹhah, + whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Rachel. In time she bore these to Jacob; all the souls were seven. 26 All the souls who came to Jacob into Egypt were those who issued out of his upper thigh, + aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons. All the souls were sixty-six. 27 And Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were seventy. * + 28 And he sent Judah + in advance of him to Joseph to impart information ahead of him * to Goʹshen. After that they came into the land of Goʹshen. * + 29 Then Joseph had his chariot made ready and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. + When he appeared to him he at once fell upon his neck and gave way to tears upon his neck again and again. + 30 Finally Israel said to Joseph: “This time I am willing to die, + now that I have seen your face, since you are still alive.” 31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh and say to him, + ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan have come here to me. + 32 And the men are shepherds, + because they became stock raisers; + and their flocks and their herds and all they have they have brought here.’ + 33 And what must occur is that when Pharʹaoh will call YOU and actually say, ‘What is YOUR occupation?’ 34 YOU must say, ‘Your servants have continued to be stock raisers from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’ + in order that YOU may dwell in the land of Goʹshen, + because every herder of sheep is a detestable thing to Egypt.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “I, the [true] God, am the God of your father.” ^ That is, to close them at Jacob’s death. ^ After “Ephraim” LXX adds five more names, as it reads: “But there were sons born to Manasseh, whom his Syrian concubine bore to him, namely, Machir. And Machir became father to Galaad. But the sons of Ephraim, Manasseh’s brother, were Sutalaam and Taam. And the sons of Sutalaam were Edem.” This may explain why LXX, in Ge 46:27 and Ex 1:5 , and Stephen, in Ac 7:14 , count 75 souls instead of 70. ^ “Seventy,” MTSyVg; LXX, “seventy-five.” ^ “To Joseph, that he might make announcement to him,” Vg. ^ “To Joseph to meet him at Heroopolis in the land of Rameses,” LXX.
