There Abraham was buried, and also Sarah his wife. + 11 And it developed that after Abraham’s death God continued to bless Isaac his son, + and Isaac was dwelling close by Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. + 12 And this is the history of Ishʹma·el + the son of Abraham whom Haʹgar the Egyptian the maidservant of Sarah bore to Abraham. + 13 Now these are the names of the sons of Ishʹma·el, by their names, according to their family origins: Ishʹma·el’s firstborn Ne·baʹioth + and Keʹdar + and Adʹbe·el and Mibʹsam + 14 and Mishʹma and Duʹmah and Masʹsa, 15 Haʹdad + and Teʹma, + Jeʹtur, Naʹphish and Kedʹe·mah. + 16 These are the sons of Ishʹma·el, and these are their names by their courtyards and by their walled camps: + twelve chieftains according to their clans. + 17 And these are the years of Ishʹma·el’s life, a hundred and thirty-seven years. Then he expired and died and was gathered to his people. + 18 And they took up tabernacling from Havʹi·lah + near Shur, + which is in front * of Egypt, as far as As·syrʹi·a. In front of all his brothers he settled down. * + 19 And this is the history of Isaac the son of Abraham. + Abraham became father to Isaac. 20 And Isaac happened to be forty years old at his taking Re·bekʹah the daughter of Be·thuʹel + the Syrian * + of Padʹdan-aʹram, * the sister of Laʹban the Syrian, as his wife. 21 And Isaac kept on entreating Jehovah especially for his wife, + because she was barren; + so Jehovah let himself be entreated for him, + and Re·bekʹah his wife became pregnant. 22 And the sons within her began to struggle with each other, + so that she said: “If this is the way it is, just why am I alive?” * With that she went to inquire of Jehovah. + 23 And Jehovah proceeded to say to her: “Two nations are in your belly, + and two national groups will be separated from your inward parts; + and the one national group will be stronger than the other national group, + and the older will serve the younger.” * + 24 Gradually her days came to the full for giving birth, and, look! twins were in her belly. + 25 Then the first came out red all over like an official garment of hair; + so they called his name Eʹsau. * + 26 And after that his brother came out and his hand was holding onto the heel of Eʹsau; + so he called his name Jacob. * + And Isaac was sixty years old at her giving them birth. 27 And the boys got bigger, and Eʹsau became a man knowing how to hunt, + a man of the field, * but Jacob a blameless man, + dwelling in tents. + 28 And Isaac had love for Eʹsau, because it meant game in his mouth, * whereas Re·bekʹah was a lover of Jacob. + 29 Once Jacob was boiling up some stew, * when Eʹsau came along from the field and he was tired. 30 So Eʹsau said to Jacob: “Quick, please, give me a swallow of the red—the red * there, for I am tired!” That is why his name was called Eʹdom. * + 31 To this Jacob said: “Sell me, first of all, your right as firstborn!” + 32 And Eʹsau continued: “Here I am simply going to die, and of what benefit to me is a birthright?” * 33 And Jacob added: “Swear to me first of all!” + And he proceeded to swear to him and to sell his right as firstborn to Jacob. + 34 And Jacob gave Eʹsau bread and lentil stew, and he went to eating and drinking. + Then he got up and went his way. So Eʹsau despised the birthright. + Footnotes ^ Since each of these three names in Heb. has the pl. ending im, it is understood that the names represent tribes or peoples. ^ “Full of days,” LXXSyVg. ^ Or, “to the east.” ^ Lit., “he fell,” M; LXX, “he dwelt (settled)”; Vg, “he died.” ^ Meaning “Plain (Flatland) of Aram (Syria)”; a part of Mesopotamia.
