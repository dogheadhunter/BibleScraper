After that Jehovah shut the door behind him. + 17 And the deluge * went on for forty days upon the earth, and the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark and it was floating high above the earth. 18 And the waters became overwhelming and kept increasing greatly upon the earth, but the ark kept going on the surface of the waters. + 19 And the waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly that all the tall mountains that were under the whole heavens came to be covered. + 20 Up to fifteen cubits the waters overwhelmed them and the mountains became covered. + 21 So all flesh that was moving upon the earth expired, + among the flying creatures and among the domestic animals and among the wild beasts and among all the swarms that were swarming upon the earth, and all mankind. + 22 Everything in which the breath of the force of life was active * in its nostrils, namely, all that were on the dry ground, died. + 23 Thus he wiped out every existing thing that was on the surface of the ground, from man to beast, to moving animal and to flying creature of the heavens, and they were wiped off the earth; + and only Noah and those who were with him in the ark kept on surviving. + 24 And the waters continued overwhelming the earth a hundred and fifty days.
