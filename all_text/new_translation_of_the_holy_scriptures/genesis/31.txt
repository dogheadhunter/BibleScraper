Meantime Rachel stole the teraphim * + that belonged to her father. 20 So Jacob outwitted * Laʹban the Syrian, because he had not told him that he was running away. 21 And he proceeded to run away and to get up and cross the River, + he and all he had. After that he directed his face to the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. + 22 Later, on the third day, it was told to Laʹban that Jacob had run away. 23 With that he took his brothers with him and went chasing + after him for a distance of seven days’ journey and caught up with him in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. 24 Then God came to Laʹban the Syrian + in a dream by night + and said to him: “Watch yourself that you do not go speaking either good or bad * with Jacob.” + 25 So Laʹban approached Jacob, as Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain and Laʹban had encamped his brothers * in the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. 26 Then Laʹban said to Jacob: “What have you done, in that you resorted to outwitting me and driving my daughters off like captives taken by the sword? + 27 Why did you have to run away secretly and outwit me and not tell me, that I might send you away with rejoicing and with songs, + with tambourine and with harp? + 28 And you did not give me a chance to kiss my children * and my daughters. + Now you have acted foolishly. 29 It is in the power of my hand to do harm to YOU people, + but the God of YOUR father talked to me last night, saying, ‘Watch yourself against speaking either good or bad with Jacob.’ + 30 While you have actually gone now because you have been yearning intensely for the house of your father, why, though, have you stolen my gods?” * + 31 In answer Jacob proceeded to say to Laʹban: “It was because I was afraid. + For I said to myself, ‘You might tear your daughters away from me.’ 32 Whoever it is with whom you may find your gods, * let him not live. + Before our brothers, examine for yourself what is with me and take them for yourself.” + But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. + 33 So Laʹban went on into the tent of Jacob and into the tent of Leʹah and into the tent of the two slave girls, + but did not find them. Finally he went out of Leʹah’s tent and went on into Rachel’s tent. 34 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and she resorted to putting them in the woman’s saddle basket of the camel, and she kept sitting upon them. So Laʹban went feeling through the whole tent, but did not find them. 35 Then she said to her father: “Do not let anger gleam in the eyes of my lord, * + because I am not able to get up before you, for the customary thing with women is upon me.” + So he searched on carefully, but did not find the teraphim. + 36 And Jacob became angry + and began to quarrel with Laʹban, and in answer Jacob went on to say to Laʹban: “What is the revolt on my part, + what the sin of mine, as a reason why you have hotly pursued after me? + 37 Now that you have felt through all my goods, what of all the goods of your house have you found? + Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers, + and let them decide between us two. + 38 These twenty years I have been with you. Your female sheep and your she-goats did not suffer abortions, + and the rams of your flock I never ate. 39 Any animal torn to pieces I did not bring to you. + I myself would stand the loss of it. Whether one was stolen by day or was stolen by night, you would put in a claim for it from my hand. + 40 It has been my experience that by day the heat consumed me and the cold by night, and my sleep would flee from my eyes. + 41 This makes twenty years for me in your house. I have served you * fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flock, and you kept changing my wages ten times. + 42 If the God of my father, + the God of Abraham and the Dread * of Isaac, + had not proved on my side, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. My wretchedness and the toil of my hands God has seen, and so he reproved you * last night.” + 43 Then Laʹban in answer said to Jacob: “The daughters are my daughters and the children my children and the flock my flock, and everything you are looking at is mine and my daughters’. What can I do against these today or against their children whom they have borne? 44 And now, come, let us conclude a covenant, + I and you, and it must * serve as a witness between me and you.” + 45 Accordingly Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. + 46 Then Jacob said to his brothers: “Pick up stones!” And they went taking stones and making a heap. + After that they ate there on the heap. 47 And Laʹban began calling it Jeʹgar-sa·ha·duʹtha, * but Jacob called it Galʹe·ed. * 48 And Laʹban proceeded to say: “This heap is a witness between me and you today.” That is why he called its name Galʹe·ed, + 49 and The Watchtower, * because he said: “Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen * the one from the other. + 50 If you go to afflicting my daughters + and if you go to taking wives in addition to my daughters, there is no man with us. See! * God is a witness between me and you.” + 51 And Laʹban went on to say to Jacob: “Here is this heap and here is the pillar that I have erected between me and you. 52 This heap is a witness, and the pillar is something that bears witness, + that I will not pass this heap against you and that you will not pass this heap and this pillar against me for harm. + 53 Let the god * of Abraham + and the god of Naʹhor + judge * between us, the god * of their father.” But Jacob swore by the Dread of his father Isaac. + 54 After that Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain and invited his brothers to eat bread. + Accordingly they ate bread and passed the night in the mountain. * 55 However, Laʹban got up early in the morning and kissed + his children * and his daughters and blessed them. + Then Laʹban got on his way that he might return to his own place. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “home.” Lit., “place of birth.” ^ Or, “has deceived me.” ^ “God,” MLXXVg; Sam, “Jehovah.” ^ “The [true] God of Bethel.” Heb., ha·ʼElʹ Behth-ʼElʹ; LXX, “the God who appeared to you in the place of God.” See App 1G . ^ Or, “home; relatives.” ^ Lit., “a share and an inheritance (possession),” in a figure of hendiadys.
