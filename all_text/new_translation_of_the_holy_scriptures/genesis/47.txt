Buy us and our land for bread, + and we together with our land will become slaves to Pharʹaoh; and give us seed that we may live and not die and our land not be laid desolate.” + 20 So Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians for Pharʹaoh, + because the Egyptians sold each one his field, for the famine had got a strong grip on them; and the land came to be Pharʹaoh’s. 21 As for the people, he removed them into cities from one end of the territory of Egypt to its other end. + 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, + because the rations for the priests were from Pharʹaoh and they ate their rations that Pharʹaoh gave them. + That is why they did not sell their land. + 23 Then Joseph said to the people: “See, I have today bought YOU and YOUR land for Pharʹaoh. Here is seed for YOU , and YOU must sow the land with it. + 24 When it has resulted in produce, + then YOU must give a fifth to Pharʹaoh, + but four parts will become YOURS as seed for the field and as food for YOU and for those who are in YOUR houses and for YOUR little ones to eat.” + 25 Consequently they said: “You have preserved our lives. + Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will become slaves to Pharʹaoh.” + 26 And Joseph proceeded to make it a decree down to this day over the landed estate of Egypt for Pharʹaoh to have to the amount of a fifth. Only the land of the priests as a distinct group did not become Pharʹaoh’s. + 27 And Israel continued to dwell in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goʹshen; + and they became settled in it and were fruitful and grew to be very many. + 28 And Jacob lived on in the land of Egypt for seventeen years, so that Jacob’s days, the years of his life, came to be a hundred and forty-seven years. + 29 Gradually the days approached for Israel to die. + So he called his son Joseph and said to him: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, place your hand, please, under my thigh, + and you must exercise loving-kindness and trustworthiness * toward me. + (Please, do not bury me in Egypt.) + 30 And I must lie with my fathers, + and you must carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their grave.” + Accordingly he said: “I myself shall do in keeping with your word.” 31 Then he said: “Swear to me.” So he swore to him. + At that Israel prostrated himself over the head of the couch. * + Footnotes ^ “Industrious men,” Vg. ^ Heb., sa·rehʹ . ^ Or, “the family.” ^ Lit., “for the horses .” Heb., bas· su·simʹ ; the first historic mention of horses for which Egypt became famous. ^ Lit., “second.” ^ Or, “and truth ; and faithfulness .” Heb., we· ʼemethʹ . ^ “The couch .” Heb., ham· mit·tahʹ ; LXX, “And Israel worshiped over (leaning upon) the top of his staff.” “Staff” or “rod” (Heb., mat·tehʹ, as in 38:25 ) and “bed” or “couch” (Heb., mit·tahʹ, as in 48:2 ) have identical consonants, and without the vowel points they can be read one way or the other.
