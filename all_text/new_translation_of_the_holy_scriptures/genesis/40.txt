Its clusters ripened their grapes. 11 And Pharʹaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I proceeded to take the grapes and squeeze them out into Pharʹaoh’s cup. + After that I gave the cup into Pharʹaoh’s hand.” + 12 Then Joseph said to him: “This is its interpretation: + The three twigs are three days. 13 In three days from now Pharʹaoh will lift up your head and he will certainly return you to your office; + and you will certainly give Pharʹaoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former custom when you acted as his cupbearer. + 14 Nevertheless, you must keep me in your remembrance as soon as it goes well with you, + and you must, please, perform loving-kindness with me and mention me to Pharʹaoh, + and you must get me out of this house. 15 For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; + and here also I have done nothing at all for which they should put me in the prison hole.” * + 16 When the chief of the bakers saw that he had interpreted something good, he, in turn, said to Joseph: “I too was in my dream, and here there were three baskets of white bread upon my head, 17 and in the topmost basket there were all sorts of eatables for Pharʹaoh, + the product of a baker, and there were fowls + eating them out of the basket on top of my head.” 18 Then Joseph answered and said: “This is its interpretation: + The three baskets are three days. 19 In three days from now Pharʹaoh will lift up your head from off you and will certainly hang you upon a stake; * + and the fowls will certainly eat your flesh from off you.” + 20 Now on the third day it turned out to be Pharʹaoh’s birthday, + and he proceeded to make a feast for all his servants and to lift up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the midst of his servants. + 21 Accordingly he returned the chief of the cupbearers to his post of cupbearer, + and he continued to give the cup into Pharʹaoh’s hand. 22 But the chief of the bakers he hung up, + just as Joseph had given them the interpretation. + 23 However, the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph and went on forgetting him. + Footnotes ^ “Against their lord .” Heb., la· ʼadho·n eh·hemʹ, pl. of ʼa·dhohnʹ, to denote excellence.
