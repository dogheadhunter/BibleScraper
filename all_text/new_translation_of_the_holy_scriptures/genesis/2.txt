I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement * of him.” + 19 Now Jehovah God was forming * from the ground every wild beast of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call it, each living soul, + that was its name. + 20 So the man was calling the names of all the domestic animals and of the flying creatures of the heavens and of every wild beast of the field, but for man there was found no helper * as a complement of him. 21 Hence Jehovah God had a deep sleep + fall upon the man and, while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22 And Jehovah * God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man. + 23 Then the man said: “This is at last bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. + This one will be called Woman, * Because from man * this one was taken.” + 24 That is why a man will leave his father and his mother + and he must stick to his wife * and they must become one flesh. + 25 And both of them continued to be naked, + the man and his wife, and yet they did not become ashamed. + Footnotes ^ “And he proceeded to rest.” Heb., wai·yish·bothʹ . The verb is in the imperfect state denoting incomplete or continuous action, or action in progress. See App 3C . ^ “And make it sacred .” Or, “and proceeded to sanctify it ( treat it as holy ).” Heb., wai· qad·deshʹ ʼo·thohʹ; Lat., et sanc·ti·fi·caʹvit ilʹlum . See Ex 31:13 ftn. ^ Or, “he does rest (desist).” Heb., sha·vathʹ, perfect state. It shows the characteristic of an individual, namely, God, on the seventh day of his creative week. This rendering of sha·vathʹ agrees with the inspired writer’s argument in Heb 4:3-11 . See vs 2 ftn. ^ “Making,” that is, all definite things in heaven and earth. ^ “Jehovah God.” Heb., Yehwahʹ ʼElo·himʹ . This expression, without the definite Heb. article ha before ʼElo·himʹ, is used 20 times in Ge 1–3 . The first occurrence of the expression Yehwahʹ ha·ʼElo·himʹ is in 1Ch 22:1 , where it is rendered “Jehovah the [true] God.” See App 1A . ^ “Jehovah.” Heb., יְהוָה ( YHWH, here vowel-pointed as Yehwahʹ ), meaning “He Causes to Become” (from Heb., הָוָה [ ha·wahʹ, “to become”]); LXX A (Gr.), Kyʹri·os; Syr., Mar·yaʼ; Lat., Doʹmi·nus . The first occurrence of God’s distinctive personal name, יהוה ( YHWH ); these four Heb. letters are referred to as the Tetragrammaton. The divine name identifies Jehovah as the Purposer. Only the true God could rightly and authentically bear this name. See App 1A . ^ Or, “These are the historical origins.” Heb., ʼelʹleh thoh·ledhohthʹ, “These are the begettings of”; Gr., hauʹte he biʹblos ge·neʹse·os, “This is the book of origin (source)”; Lat., iʹstae ge·ne·ra·ti·oʹnes, “These are the generations.” Compare Mt 1:1 ftn. ^ Or, “But a vapor .” Heb., we ʼedhʹ ; LXX(Gr., pe·geʹ )Vg(Lat., fons )Sy, “fountain,” suggesting an underground fresh-water stream; T, “cloud.” ^ “A living soul [breathing creature].” Heb., le neʹphesh chai·yahʹ; Gr., ψυχὴν ζῶσαν ( psy·khenʹ zoʹsan, “living soul ”); Lat., aʹni·mam vi·venʹtem . See 1:20, 21, 30; 1Co 15:45 ; App 4A . ^ “ Breath of life.” Heb., nish·mathʹ (from nesha·mahʹ ) chai·yimʹ . ^ Or, “clay,” according to the later usage of the Heb. word in pottery making. Heb., ʽa·pharʹ . ^ “Jehovah.” Heb., Yehwahʹ; LXX​ P. Oxy. VII.1007 . This vellum leaf of the third cent. C.E. abbreviated the Tetragrammaton in vss 8 and 18 by doubling the first letter Yohdh, which was written as a “Z,” with a horizontal line extended through the center of both letters. See App 1C §6. ^ “A garden [or, park] in Eden .” Heb., gan-be ʽEʹdhen (“Eden,” meaning “Pleasure; Delight”); LXX Bagster (Gr.), pa·raʹdei·son en E·demʹ ; Lat., pa·ra·diʹsum vo·lu·ptaʹtis, “paradise of pleasure.” ^ “From the beginning,” Vg. ^ This Heb. participle denotes a continuous stream. ^ Heb., Kush; LXXVg, “Ethiopia.” ^ Heb., Chid·deʹqel; LXXVg, “Tigris.” ^ “Assyria.” Heb., ʼAsh·shurʹ; LXXVg, “Assyrians.” ^ “Euphrates,” LXXVg; Heb., Pherathʹ . ^ “You will positively die.” Lit., “ dying you [sing.] will die .” Heb., mohth ta· muthʹ ; the first reference to death in the Bible. See Eze 3:18 ftn. ^ See App 1C §6. ^ Or, “counterpart,” something fitting for him. ^ In point of time it was still the sixth creative day. The verb “form” in the imperfect here denotes continued, progressive action. See App 3C . ^ Lit., “he did not find a helper.” ^ Heb., Yehwahʹ . ^ Lit., “a female man.” Heb., ʼish·shahʹ . ^ “From man .” Heb., me· ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “woman.” Previous Next Print Share Share
