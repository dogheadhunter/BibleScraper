Then he sent out the dove, but it did not come back again to him anymore. + 13 Now in the six hundred and first year, + in the first month, * on the first day of the month, it came about that the waters had drained from off the earth; and Noah proceeded to remove the covering of the ark and to look, and here the surface of the ground had drained dry. + 14 And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried off. + 15 God now spoke to Noah, saying: 16 “Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons’ wives with you. + 17 Every living creature that is with you of every sort of flesh, + among the flying creatures + and among the beasts + and among all the moving animals that move upon the earth, + bring out with you, as they must swarm in the earth and be fruitful and become many upon the earth.” + 18 At that Noah went out, and also his sons + and his wife and his sons’ wives with him. 19 Every living creature, every moving animal and every flying creature, everything that moves on the earth, according to their families they went out of the ark. + 20 And Noah began to build an altar + to Jehovah and to take some of all the clean beasts + and of all the clean flying creatures + and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar. + 21 And Jehovah began to smell a restful * odor, + and so Jehovah said in his heart: + “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground + on man’s account, because the inclination + of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; + and never again shall I deal every living thing a blow just as I have done. + 22 For all the days the earth continues, * seed sowing and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, will never cease.” + Footnotes ^ Heb., ruʹach; previously translated “active force; breezy part; spirit.” ^ Or, “water canopy.” See 7:11 ftn, “Deep.” ^ Or, “windows.” ^ “Progressively receding.” Lit., “going and receding.” ^ “Seventh month.” This corresponded to the month Abib (or, Nisan), the first month of the Jewish sacred calendar after the Exodus.
