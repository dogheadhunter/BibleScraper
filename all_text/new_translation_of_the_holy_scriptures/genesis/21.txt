Listen to her voice, because it is by means of Isaac that what will be called your seed will be. + 13 And as for the son of the slave girl, + I shall also constitute him a nation, because he is your offspring.” + 14 So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin water bottle and gave it to Haʹgar, + setting it upon her shoulder, and the child, + and then dismissed her. And she went her way and wandered about in the wilderness of Beʹer-sheʹba. * + 15 Finally the water became exhausted + in the skin bottle and she threw + the child under one of the bushes. 16 Then she went on and sat down by herself, about the distance of a bowshot away, because she said: “Let me not see it when the child dies.” + So she sat down at a distance and began to raise her voice and weep. * + 17 At that God heard the voice of the boy, + and God’s angel called to Haʹgar out of the heavens and said to her: + “What is the matter with you, Haʹgar? Do not be afraid, because God has listened to the voice of the boy there where he is. 18 Get up, lift up the boy and take hold of him with your hand, because I shall constitute him a great nation.” + 19 Then God opened her eyes so that she caught sight of a well of water; + and she went and began to fill the skin bottle with water and to give the boy a drink. 20 And God continued to be with the boy, + and he kept growing and dwelling in the wilderness; and he became an archer. * + 21 And he took up dwelling in the wilderness of Paʹran, + and his mother proceeded to take a wife for him from the land of Egypt. 22 Now it came about at that time that A·bimʹe·lech together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army said to Abraham: “God * is with you in everything you are doing. + 23 So now swear to me here by God + that you will not prove false to me and to my offspring and to my posterity; + that, according to the loyal love with which I have dealt with you, + you will deal with me and with the land in which you have been residing as an alien.” + 24 So Abraham said: “I shall swear.” + 25 When Abraham criticized A·bimʹe·lech severely as regards the well of water that the servants of A·bimʹe·lech had seized by violence, + 26 then A·bimʹe·lech said: “I do not know who did this thing, neither did you yourself tell it to me, and I myself have also not heard of it except today.” + 27 With that Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to A·bimʹe·lech, + and both of them proceeded to conclude * a covenant. + 28 When Abraham set seven female lambs of the flock by themselves, 29 A·bimʹe·lech went on to say to Abraham: “What is the meaning here of these seven female lambs that you have set by themselves?” 30 Then he said: “You are to accept the seven female lambs at my hand, that it may serve as a witness + for me that I have dug this well.” 31 That is why he called that place Beʹer-sheʹba, + because there both of them had taken an oath. 32 So they concluded a covenant + at Beʹer-sheʹba, after which A·bimʹe·lech got up together with Phiʹcol the chief of his army and they returned to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines. + 33 After that he planted a tamarisk tree at Beʹer-sheʹba and called there upon the name of Jehovah + the indefinitely lasting God. * + 34 And Abraham extended his residence as an alien in the land of the Phi·lisʹtines many days. + Footnotes ^ Meaning “Well of the Oath [or, of Seven].” Heb., Beʼerʹ shaʹvaʽ . ^ “And raising his voice the young child wept,” LXX. ^ Lit., “became an archer, a bowman.” ^ Heb., ʼElo·himʹ, pl. to denote excellence and without the definite article. ^ Or, “cut.” ^ Or, “God to time indefinite.” Heb., ʼEl ʽoh·lamʹ, “God of eternity.” Previous Next Print Share Share
