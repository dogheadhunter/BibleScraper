Please, separate from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; but if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.” + 10 So Lot raised his eyes and saw the whole District * of the Jordan, + that all of it was a well-watered region before Jehovah brought Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah to ruin, like the garden * of Jehovah, + like the land of Egypt as far as Zoʹar. * + 11 Then Lot chose for himself the whole District of the Jordan, and Lot moved his camp to the east. So they separated the one from the other. 12 Aʹbram dwelt in the land of Caʹnaan, but Lot dwelt among the cities of the District. + Finally he pitched tent near Sodʹom. 13 And the men of Sodʹom were bad and were gross sinners against Jehovah. + 14 And Jehovah said to Aʹbram after Lot had separated from him: “Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward * and eastward and westward, * + 15 because all the land at which you are looking, to you and to your seed I am going to give it until time indefinite. + 16 And I will constitute your seed like the dust particles of the earth, so that, if a man could be able to count the dust particles of the earth, then your seed could be numbered. + 17 Get up, go about in the land through its length and through its breadth, because to you I am going to give it.” + 18 So Aʹbram continued to live in tents. * Later on he came and dwelt among the big trees of Mamʹre, + which are in Heʹbron; + and there he proceeded to build an altar to Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Or, “proceeded to declare (preach) there.” ^ Lit., “whole land before.” ^ Or, “Basin.” Heb., Kik·karʹ .
