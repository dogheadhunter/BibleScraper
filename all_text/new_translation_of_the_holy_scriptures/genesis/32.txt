And from what came to his hand he proceeded to take a gift for Eʹsau his brother: + 14 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty rams, 15 thirty camels giving suck and their young ones, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten full-grown asses. + 16 Then he handed over to his servants one drove after another by itself and repeatedly said to his servants: “Cross over ahead of me, and YOU are to set an interval between drove and drove.” + 17 Further he commanded the first one, saying: “In case that Eʹsau my brother should meet you and ask you, saying, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going and to whom do these ahead of you belong?’ 18 then you must say, ‘To your servant, to Jacob. A gift it is, + sent to my lord, + to Eʹsau, and look! he himself is also behind us.’” 19 And he went on to command also the second, also the third, also all those following the droves, saying: “According to this word YOU are to speak to Eʹsau on YOUR encountering him. + 20 And YOU must say also, ‘Here is your servant Jacob behind us.’” + For he said to himself: “I may appease him by the gift going ahead of me, + and afterward I shall see his face. Perhaps he will give a kindly reception.” + 21 So the gift went crossing over ahead of him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp. + 22 Later during that night he rose and took his two wives + and his two maidservants + and his eleven young sons + and crossed over the ford of Jabʹbok. + 23 So he took them and brought them over the torrent valley, * + and he brought over what he had. 24 Finally Jacob was left by himself. Then a man began to grapple with him until the dawn ascended. + 25 When he got to see that he had not prevailed over him, + then he touched the socket of his thigh joint; * and the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint got out of place during his grappling with him. + 26 After that he said: “Let me go, * for the dawn has ascended.” To this he said: “I am not going to let you go until you first bless me.” + 27 So he said to him: “What is your name?” to which he said: “Jacob.” 28 Then he said: “Your name will no longer be called Jacob but Israel, * + for you have contended * + with God and with men so that you at last prevailed.” 29 In turn Jacob inquired and said: “Tell me, please, your name.” However, he said: “Why is it that you inquire for my name?” + With that he blessed him there. 30 Hence Jacob called the name of the place Pe·niʹel, * + because, to quote him, “I have seen God face to face and yet my soul was delivered.” + 31 And the sun began to flash upon him as soon as he passed by Pe·nuʹel, but he was limping upon his thigh. + 32 That is why the sons of Israel are not accustomed to eat the sinew of the thigh nerve, * which is on the socket of the thigh joint, down to this day, because he touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve. + Footnotes ^ Or, “messengers,” as in vss 3, 6. ^ Meaning “Two Camps.” ^ Or, “the truth .” Heb., ha· ʼemethʹ . ^ Or, “offspring; posterity.” ^ Or, “the wadi; the arroyo; the stream [the wadi running with water].” ^ Or, “touched the hollow of his hip.” ^ Lit., “Send me away.” ^ Meaning “God Contends; Contender (Perseverer) With God.” Heb., Yis·ra·ʼelʹ . ^ Or, “persisted; exerted yourself; persevered,” according to BDB, p. 975. ^ Meaning “Face of God .” Heb., Peni· ʼelʹ . ^ Or, “thigh vein.” Previous Next Print Share Share
