He was then dwelling in Sodʹom. + 13 After that a man who had escaped came and told Aʹbram the Hebrew. * + He was then tabernacling among the big trees of Mamʹre the Amʹor·ite, + the brother of Eshʹcol and brother of Aʹner; + and they were confederates * of Aʹbram. 14 Thus Aʹbram got to hear that his brother had been taken captive. + With that he mustered his trained men, + three hundred and eighteen slaves born in his household, * + and went in pursuit up to Dan. + 15 And by night he resorted to dividing his forces, + he and his slaves, against them, and thus he defeated them and kept in pursuit of them up to Hoʹbah, which is north * of Damascus. 16 And he proceeded to recover all the goods, + and he recovered also Lot his brother and his goods and also the women and the people. + 17 Then the king of Sodʹom went out to meet him after he returned from defeating Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings that were with him, to the Low Plain of Shaʹveh, * that is, the king’s Low Plain. + 18 And Mel·chizʹe·dek + king of Saʹlem + brought out bread and wine, + and he was priest * of the Most High God. * + 19 Then he blessed him and said: “Blessed be Aʹbram of the Most High God, + Producer * of heaven and earth; + 20 And blessed be the Most High God, + Who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!” + At that Aʹbram * gave him a tenth * of everything. + 21 After that the king of Sodʹom said to Aʹbram: “Give me the souls, * + but take the goods for yourself.” 22 At this Aʹbram said to the king of Sodʹom: “I do lift up my hand [in an oath] + to Jehovah the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth, 23 that, from a thread to a sandal lace, no, I shall take nothing from anything that is yours, + in order that you may not say, ‘It was I who made Aʹbram rich.’ 24 Nothing for me! + Only what the young men have already eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aʹner, Eshʹcol and Mamʹre + —let them take their share.” + Footnotes ^ “Now it came about in the days of.” Heb., wai·hiʹ bi·mehʹ .
