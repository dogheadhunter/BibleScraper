I have also come off winner!” So she called his name Naphʹta·li. * + 9 When Leʹah came to see that she had left off giving birth, she proceeded to take Zilʹpah her maidservant and to give her to Jacob as wife. + 10 In time Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s maidservant, bore a son to Jacob. 11 Then Leʹah said: “With good fortune!” * So she called his name Gad. * + 12 After that Zilʹpah, Leʹah’s maidservant, bore a second son to Jacob. 13 Then Leʹah said: “With my happiness! For the daughters will certainly pronounce me happy.” + So she called his name Ashʹer. * + 14 Now Reuʹben + went walking in the days of the wheat harvest + and got to find mandrakes in the field. So he brought them to Leʹah his mother. Then Rachel said to Leʹah: “Give me, please, some of your son’s mandrakes.” + 15 At this she said to her: “Is this a little thing, your having taken my husband, + with your now taking also my son’s mandrakes?” So Rachel said: “For that reason he is going to lie down with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 16 When Jacob was coming from the field in the evening, + Leʹah went on out to meet him and then said: “It is with me you are going to have relations, because I have hired you outright with my son’s mandrakes.” Accordingly he lay down with her that night. + 17 And God heard and answered Leʹah and she became pregnant and in time bore to Jacob a fifth son. + 18 Then Leʹah said: “God has given me a hireling’s wages, * because I have given my maidservant to my husband.” So she called his name Isʹsa·char. * + 19 And Leʹah became pregnant once more and in time bore a sixth son to Jacob. + 20 Then Leʹah said: “God has endowed me, yes, me, with a good endowment. At last my husband will tolerate * me, * + because I have borne him six sons.” + So she called his name Zebʹu·lun. * + 21 And afterward she bore a daughter and then called her name Diʹnah. * + 22 Finally God remembered Rachel, and God heard and answered her in that he opened her womb. + 23 And she became pregnant and brought a son to birth. Then she said: “God has taken away my reproach!” + 24 So she called his name Joseph, * + saying: “Jehovah is adding another son to me.” 25 And it followed that when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob immediately said to Laʹban: “Send me away that I may go to my place and to my country. + 26 Give over my wives and my children, for whom I have served with you, that I may go; for you yourself must know my service which I have rendered you.” + 27 Then Laʹban said to him: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes,—I have taken the omens to the effect that Jehovah is blessing me due to you.” + 28 And he added: “Stipulate your wages to me and I shall give them.” + 29 So he said to him: “You yourself must know how I have served you and how your herd has fared with me; + 30 that it was little that you actually had before my coming, and it went expanding to a multitude, in that Jehovah blessed you since I stepped in. + So now when am I to do something also for my own house?” + 31 Then he said: “What shall I give you?” And Jacob went on to say: “You will give me nothing whatsoever! + If you will do this thing for me, I shall resume shepherding your flock. + I shall continue guarding it. + 32 I will pass among your whole flock today. You set aside from there every sheep speckled and with color patches, and every dark-brown sheep among the young rams and any color-patched and speckled one among the she-goats. Hereafter such must be my wages. + 33 And my right-doing must answer for me on whatever future day you may come to look over my wages; + every one that is not speckled and color-patched among the she-goats and dark brown among the young rams is something stolen if it is with me.” + 34 To this Laʹban said: “Why, that is fine! * Let it be according to your word.” + 35 Then he set aside on that day the he-goats striped and color-patched and all the she-goats speckled and color-patched, every one in which there was any white and every one dark brown among the young rams, but he gave them over into the hands of his sons. 36 After that he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was shepherding the flocks of Laʹban that remained over. 37 Then Jacob took for his use staffs * still moist of the storax tree + and of the almond tree + and of the plane tree + and peeled in them white peeled spots by laying bare white places which were upon the staffs. + 38 Finally the staffs that he had peeled he placed in front of the flock, in the gutters, in the water drinking troughs, + where the flocks would come to drink, that they might get into a heat * before them when they came to drink. 39 Consequently the flocks would get in heat before the staffs, and the flocks would produce striped, speckled and color-patched ones. + 40 And Jacob separated the young rams and then turned the faces of the flocks to the striped ones and all the dark-brown ones among the flocks of Laʹban. Then he set his own droves by themselves and did not set them by the flocks of Laʹban. 41 And it always occurred that whenever the robust + flocks would get in heat, Jacob would locate the staffs in the gutters + before the eyes of the flocks, that they might get in heat by the staffs. 42 But when the flocks showed feebleness he would not locate them there. So the feeble ones always came to be Laʹban’s, but the robust ones Jacob’s. + 43 And the man went on increasing more and more, and great flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses came to be his. + Footnotes ^ Meaning “Judge.” Heb., Dan . ^ Meaning “My Wrestlings.” Heb., Naph·ta·liʹ . ^ Or, “superhuman.” Lit., “God’s.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ, without the definite article. ^ “Good fortune has come!” M margin . ^ Meaning “Good Fortune.” Heb., Gadh . ^ Meaning “Happy; Happiness.” Heb., ʼA·sherʹ . ^ Lit., “given my wage [as a hireling].” ^ Meaning “He Is Wages; He Brings Wages.” Heb., Yis·sas·kharʹ . ^ Meaning “Habitation; Dwelling”; possibly, “Toleration; Lordship.” Heb., Zevu·lunʹ . ^ Or, “At last my husband will make me his legitimate wife.” (For this possible rendering see VT, Vol. I, 1951, pp. 59, 60.)
