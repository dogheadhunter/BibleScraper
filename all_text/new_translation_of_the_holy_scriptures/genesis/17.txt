Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. + He will certainly produce twelve chieftains, * and I will make him become a great nation. + 21 However, my covenant I shall establish with Isaac, + whom Sarah will bear to you at this appointed time next year.” + 22 With that God finished speaking with him and went up from Abraham. + 23 Abraham then proceeded to take Ishʹma·el his son and all the men born in his house and everyone purchased with money of his, every male among the men of the household of Abraham, and he went to circumcising the flesh of their foreskins in this very day, just as God had spoken with him. + 24 And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised. + 25 And Ishʹma·el his son was thirteen years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised. + 26 In this very day Abraham got circumcised, and also Ishʹma·el his son. + 27 And all the men of his household, anyone born in the house and anyone purchased with money from a foreigner, got circumcised with him. + Footnotes ^ “God Almighty.” Heb., ʼEl Shad·daiʹ . ^ Heb., ʼElo·himʹ, pl., without the definite article. ^ Meaning “Father of Exaltation.” Heb., ʼAv·ramʹ . ^ Meaning “Father of a Multitude.” Heb., ʼAv·ra·hamʹ . ^ “Myself God.” Lit., “for a God.” Heb., lEʼ·lo·himʹ, pl., without the definite article. ^ Or, “any son of a slave.” ^ Lit., “silver.” Heb., keʹseph . ^ Meaning “Contentious.” Heb., Sa·raiʹ . ^ Meaning “Princess.” Heb., Sa·rahʹ . ^ See App 1F . ^ Meaning “Laughter.” Heb., Yits·chaqʹ; an example of onomatopoeia, where the sound suggests the sense. ^ Or, “nasis.” Heb., nesi·ʼimʹ; Vg, “dukes; leaders”; LXX, “nations.” Previous Next Print Share Share
