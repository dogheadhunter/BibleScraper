I said: “I will become wise.” But it was far from me. + 24 What has come to be is far off and exceedingly deep. Who can find it out? + 25 I myself turned around, even my heart did, + to know and to explore and to search for wisdom + and the reason of things, + and to know about the wickedness of stupidity and the foolishness of madness; + 26 and I was finding out: More bitter than death + [I found] the woman who is herself nets for hunting and whose heart is dragnets [and] whose hands are fetters. + One is good before the [true] God if one escapes from her, but one is sinning if one is captured by her. + 27 “See! This I have found,” said the congregator, * + “one thing [taken] after another, to find out the sum-up, + 28 which my soul has continuously sought, but I have not found. One man out of a thousand I have found, + but a woman among all these I have not found. + 29 See! This only I have found, that the [true] God made mankind * upright, + but they themselves have sought out many plans.” + Footnotes ^ “A name.” Heb., shem; LXXVg, “A good name.” See Pr 22:1 ftn. ^ See 6:2 ftn. ^ Lit., “long in spirit.” ^ Or, “Wisdom [compared] with a possession is better and is more profitable.” ^ Lit., “for a shadow .” Heb., be tselʹ . ^ See 6:7 ftn. ^ “Said the congregator.” The verb and subject are both fem.
