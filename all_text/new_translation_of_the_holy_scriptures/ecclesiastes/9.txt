The good one is the same as the sinner; + the one swearing is the same as whoever has been afraid of a sworn oath. + 3 This is what is calamitous in all that has been done under the sun, that, because there is one eventuality to all, + the heart of the sons of men is also full of bad; + and there is madness + in their heart during their lifetime, and after it—to the dead ones! + 4 For as respects whoever is joined * to all the living there exists confidence, because a live dog + is better off than a dead lion. + 5 For the living are conscious that they will die; * + but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, * + neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. + 6 Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, + and they have no portion anymore to time indefinite in anything that has to be done under the sun. + 7 Go, eat your food * with rejoicing and drink your wine with a good heart, + because already the [true] God has found pleasure in your works. + 8 On every occasion let your garments prove to be white, + and let oil not be lacking upon your head. + 9 See life with the wife whom you love + all the days of your vain life that He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity, for that is your portion in life + and in your hard work with which you are working hard under the sun. 10 All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, + for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge + nor wisdom + in Sheʹol, * + the place to which you are going. + 11 I returned to see * under the sun that the swift do not have the race, + nor the mighty ones the battle, + nor do the wise also have the food, * + nor do the understanding ones also have the riches, + nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; + because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all. * + 12 For man + also does not know his time. + Just like fishes that are being taken in an evil net, + and like birds that are being taken in a trap, + so the sons of men themselves are being ensnared at a calamitous time, + when it falls upon them suddenly. + 13 Also this I saw as respects wisdom under the sun—and it * was great to me: 14 There was a little city, and the men * in it were few; and there came to it a great king, and he surrounded it and built against it great strongholds. + 15 And there was found in it a man, * needy [but] * wise, and that one provided escape for the city by his wisdom. + But no man remembered that needy man. + 16 And I myself said: “Wisdom is better than mightiness; + yet the wisdom of the needy one is despised, and his words are not listened to.” + 17 The words of the wise ones in quietness are more to be heard + than the cry of one ruling among stupid people. + 18 Wisdom is better than implements for fighting, and merely one sinner can destroy much good. + Footnotes ^ “Is joined,” M margin LXXSy and many Heb. mss. ^ Lit., “and the dead ones , they are not knowing anything .” Heb., weham· me·thimʹ ʼeh·n amʹ yoh·dheʽimʹ meʼuʹmah . ^ Lit., “For the living ones are knowing that they will die .” Heb., ki ha· chai·yimʹ yoh·dheʽimʹ shey·ya· muʹth u . ^ Lit., “your bread .” Heb., lach·m eʹkha . ^ “In Sheol .” Heb., bi sh·ʼohlʹ ; T, “the house of the grave”; Gr., haiʹdei ; Lat., inʹfe·ros .
