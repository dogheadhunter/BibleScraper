This is vanity and it is a bad sickness. 3 If a man should become a father a hundred times, + and he should live many years, so that numerous the days of his years should become, + yet his own soul is not satisfied with good things + and even the grave has not become his, + I must say that one prematurely born is better off than he is. + 4 For in vain has this one come and in darkness he goes away, and with darkness his own name will be covered. + 5 Even the sun itself he has not seen, neither known. + This one has rest rather than the former one. + 6 Even supposing that he has lived a thousand years twice over and yet he has not seen what is good, + is it not to just one place that everyone is going? + 7 All the hard work of mankind * is for their mouth, + but even their own soul does not get filled. 8 For what advantage does the wise have over the stupid one? + What does the afflicted one have in knowing how to walk in front of the living ones? 9 Better is the seeing by the eyes than the walking about of the soul. * + This too is vanity and a striving after the wind. + 10 Whatever has come to be, its name has already been pronounced, and it has become known what man * is; + and he is not able to plead his cause with one that is more powerful than he is. + 11 Because there exist many things that are causing much vanity, + what advantage does a man have? 12 For who is there knowing what good a man has in life + for the number of the days of his vain life, when he spends them like a shadow? + For who can tell man what will happen after him under the sun? + Footnotes ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Lit., “the earthling man .” Heb., ha· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “soulful desire.” ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ .
