[So] a little foolishness does to one who is precious for wisdom and glory. + 2 The heart of the wise is at his right hand, + but the heart of the stupid at his left hand. + 3 And also in whatever way the foolish one is walking, + his own heart is lacking, * and he certainly says to everybody that he is foolish. + 4 If the spirit of a ruler should mount up against you, do not leave your own place, + for calmness itself allays great sins. + 5 There exists something calamitous that I have seen under the sun, as when there is a mistake + going forth on account of the one in power: + 6 Foolishness * has been put in many high positions, + but the rich ones themselves keep dwelling merely in a low condition. 7 I have seen servants on horses but princes walking on the earth just like servants. + 8 He that is digging a pit will himself fall right into it; + and he that is breaking through a stone wall, a serpent will bite him. + 9 He that is quarrying out stones will hurt himself with them. He that is splitting logs will have to be careful with them. + 10 If an iron tool has become blunt and someone has not whetted its edge, + then he will exert his own vital energies. So the using of wisdom to success means advantage. + 11 If the serpent bites when no charming results, + then there is no advantage to the one indulging in the tongue. 12 The words of the mouth of the wise one mean favor, + but the lips of the stupid one swallow him up. + 13 The start of the words of his mouth is foolishness, + and the end afterward of his mouth is calamitous madness. 14 And the foolish one speaks many words. + Man * does not know what will come to be; and that which will come to be after him, who can tell him? + 15 The hard work of the stupid ones makes them weary, + because not one has come to know how to go to the city. + 16 How will it be with you, O land, when your king is a boy + and your own princes keep eating even in the morning? 17 Happy are you, O land, when your king is the son of noble ones and your own princes eat at the proper time for mightiness, not for mere drinking. + 18 Through great laziness the beamwork sinks in, and through the letting down of the hands the house leaks. + 19 Bread * is for the laughter of the workers, and wine itself makes life rejoice; + but money * is what meets a response in all things. + 20 Even in your bedroom do not call down evil upon the king himself, + and in the interior rooms where you lie down do not call down evil upon anyone rich; + for a flying creature of the heavens will convey the sound and something owning wings will tell the matter. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Flies of death.” ^ Or, “his own good motive is lacking .” Heb., lib· bohʹ cha·serʹ . ^ “Foolishness,” M; LXXSyVg, “The foolish one.” ^ Lit., “The earthling man .” Heb., ha· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “Food.” Heb., leʹchem . ^ Lit., “but the silver .” Heb., wehak· keʹseph .
