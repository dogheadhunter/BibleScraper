The thing that people have already done. 13 And I saw, even I, that there exists more advantage for wisdom than for folly, + just as there is more advantage for light than for darkness. + 14 As regards anyone wise, his eyes are in his head; + but the stupid one is walking on in sheer darkness. + And I have come to know, I too, that there is one eventuality that eventuates to them all. + 15 And I myself said in my heart: + “An eventuality like that upon the stupid one + will eventuate to me, yes, me.” + Why, then, had I become wise, I overmuch so + at that time? And I spoke in my heart: “This too is vanity.” 16 For there is no more remembrance of the wise one than of the stupid one to time indefinite. + In the days that are already coming in, everyone is certainly forgotten; and how will the wise one die? Along with the stupid one. + 17 And I hated life, + because the work that has been done under the sun was calamitous from my standpoint, + for everything was vanity and a striving after wind. + 18 And I, even I, hated all my hard work at which I was working hard under the sun, + that I would leave behind for the man who would come to be after me. + 19 And who is there knowing whether he will prove to be wise or foolish? + Yet he will take control over all my hard work at which I worked hard and at which I showed wisdom under the sun. + This too is vanity. 20 And I myself turned around toward making my heart despair + over all the hard work at which I had worked hard under the sun. 21 For there exists the man whose hard work has been with wisdom and with knowledge and with proficiency, + but to a man that has not worked hard at such a thing will be given the portion of that one. + This too is vanity and a big calamity. + 22 For what does a man come to have * for all his hard work and for the striving of his heart with which he is working hard under the sun? + 23 For all his days his occupation means pains and vexation, + also during the night his heart just does not lie down. + This too is mere vanity. 24 With a man there is nothing better [than] that he should eat and indeed drink and cause his soul to see good because of his hard work. + This too I have seen, even I, that this is from the hand of the [true] God. * + 25 For who eats + and who drinks * better than I do? + 26 For to the man that is good before him + he has given wisdom and knowledge and rejoicing, + but to the sinner he has given the occupation of gathering and bringing together merely to give to the one that is good before the [true] God. + This too is vanity and a striving after wind. + Footnotes ^ “And parks .” Heb., u ·phar·de·simʹ , pl. of par·desʹ; LXXSy, “parks; paradises.” ^ Lit., “what is there proving to be for the man?” Heb., meh- ho·wehʹ la·ʼa·dhamʹ?
