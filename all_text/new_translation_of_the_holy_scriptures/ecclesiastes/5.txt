That is why your words should prove to be few. + 3 For a dream certainly comes in because of abundance of occupation, + and the voice of a stupid one because of the abundance of words. + 4 Whenever you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it, + for there is no delight in the stupid ones. + What you vow, pay. + 5 Better is it that you vow + not than that you vow and do not pay. + 6 Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin, * + neither say before the angel * + that it was a mistake. + Why should the [true] God become indignant on account of your voice and have to wreck the work of your hands? + 7 For because of abundance [of occupation] there are dreams, + and there are vanities and words in abundance. But fear the [true] God himself. + 8 If you see any oppression of the one of little means and the violent taking away of judgment + and of righteousness in a jurisdictional district, do not be amazed over the affair, + for one that is higher than the high one + is watching, + and there are those who are high above them. * 9 Also, the profit of the earth is among them all; + for a field the king himself has been served. + 10 A mere lover of silver will not be satisfied with silver, neither any lover of wealth with income. * + This too is vanity. + 11 When good things become many, those eating them certainly become many. + And what advantage is there to the grand owner of them, except looking [at them] with his eyes? + 12 Sweet is the sleep + of the one serving, regardless of whether it is little or much that he eats; but the plenty belonging to the rich one is not permitting him to sleep. 13 There exists a grave calamity that I have seen under the sun: riches being kept for their grand owner * to his calamity. + 14 And those riches have perished + because of a calamitous occupation, and he has become father to a son when there is nothing at all in his hand. + 15 Just as one has come forth from his mother’s belly, naked will one go away again, + just as one came; and nothing at all can one carry away + for his hard work, which he can take along with his hand. 16 And this too is a grave calamity: exactly as one has come, so one will go away; and what profit is there to the one who keeps working hard for the wind? + 17 Also, all his days he eats in darkness itself, with a great deal of vexation, + with sickness on his part and [cause for] indignation. 18 Look! The best thing that I myself have seen, which is pretty, is that one should eat and drink and see good for all his hard work + with which he works hard under the sun for the number of the days of his life that the [true] God has given him, for that is his portion. 19 Also every man to whom the [true] God has given riches and material possessions, + he has even empowered him to eat from it + and to carry off his portion and to rejoice in his hard work. + This is the gift of God. + 20 For not often will he remember the days of his life, because the [true] God is preoccupying * [him] with the rejoicing of his heart. + Footnotes ^ “Let there be a drawing near.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ MTLXXSyVg end chapter 4 here as vs 17. ^ “Do not allow the word of your mouth to determine the judgment of Gehenna upon your flesh,” T. ^ “Angel,” MTVg; LXXSy, “God.” ^ Or, “and there is the Supreme One above them.” ^ Lit., “and who is setting his love on wealthiness with no income (revenue)?” ^ “For their grand owner .” Heb., li v·ʽa·l avʹ . ^ Possibly, “answering,” according to another derivation of the Heb. verb.
