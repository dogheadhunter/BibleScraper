And the almond tree carries blossoms, + and the grasshopper drags itself along, and the caper berry bursts, because man * is walking to his long-lasting house + and the wailers have marched around in the street; + 6 before the silver cord is removed, and the golden bowl gets crushed, + and the jar at the spring is broken, and the waterwheel for the cistern has been crushed. 7 Then the dust returns to the earth + just as it happened to be and the spirit + itself returns to the [true] God + who gave it. + 8 “The greatest vanity!” * said the congregator, * + “Everything is vanity.” + 9 And besides the fact that the congregator had become wise, + he also taught the people knowledge continually, + and he pondered and made a thorough search, + that he might arrange many proverbs in order. + 10 The congregator sought to find the delightful words + and the writing of correct words of truth. + 11 The words of the wise ones are like oxgoads, + and just like nails driven in * + are those indulging in collections * [of sentences]; they have been given from one shepherd. + 12 As regards anything besides these, my son, take a warning: To the making of many books there is no end, and much devotion [to them] is wearisome to the flesh. + 13 The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the [true] God + and keep his commandments. + For this is the whole [obligation] of man. * 14 For the [true] God himself will bring every sort of work into the judgment in relation to every hidden thing, as to whether it is good or bad. + Footnotes ^ Or, “youth.” ^ “Your Grand Creator .” Heb., Boh·reʼ eyʹkha .
