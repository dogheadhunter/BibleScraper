Also, his eyes themselves are not satisfied with riches: + “And for whom am I working hard and causing my soul to lack in good things?” + This too is vanity, and it is a calamitous occupation. + 9 Two are better than one, + because they have a good reward for their hard work. + 10 For if one of them should fall, the other one can raise his partner up. + But how will it be with just the one * who falls when there is not another to raise him up? + 11 Moreover, if two lie down together, they also will certainly get warm; but how can just one keep warm? + 12 And if somebody could overpower one alone, two together could make a stand against him. + And a threefold cord cannot quickly be torn in two. 13 Better is a needy but wise child + than an old but stupid king, + who has not come to know enough to be warned any longer. + 14 For he has gone forth from the prison house itself to become king, + although in the kingship of this one he had been born as one of little means. + 15 I have seen all those alive who are walking about under the sun, [how it goes] with the child, who is second, that stands up in the other one’s place. + 16 There is no end to all the people, to all those before whom he * happened to be; + neither will people afterward rejoice in him, + for this too is vanity and a striving after the wind. + Footnotes ^ “One.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “But woe to just the one!” ^ Or, “they,” that is, “the people.” Previous Next Print Share Share
