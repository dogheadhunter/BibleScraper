Everything is vanity!” + 3 What profit does a man * have in all his hard work at which he works + hard under the sun? * + 4 A generation is going, + and a generation is coming; + but the earth is standing even to time indefinite. + 5 And the sun also has flashed forth, and the sun has set, + and it is coming panting to its place where it is going to flash forth. + 6 The wind * is going to the south, and it is circling around to the north. + Round and round it * is continually circling, + and right back to its circlings + the wind * is returning. 7 All the winter torrents + are going forth to the sea, + yet the sea itself is not full. + To the place where the winter torrents are going forth, there they are returning so as to go forth. + 8 All things are wearisome; + no one is able to speak of it. The eye is not satisfied at seeing, + neither is the ear filled from hearing. + 9 That which has come to be, that is what will come to be; + and that which has been done, that is what will be done; and so there is nothing new under the sun. * + 10 Does anything exist of which one may say: “See this; it is new”? It has already had existence for time indefinite; + what has come into existence is from time prior to us. + 11 There is no remembrance of people of former times, nor will there be of those also who will come to be later. + There will prove to be no remembrance even of them among those who will come to be still later on. + 12 I, the congregator, * happened to be king over Israel in Jerusalem. + 13 And I set my heart to seek and explore wisdom + in relation to everything that has been done under the heavens—the calamitous occupation that God has given to the sons of mankind * in which to be occupied. + 14 I saw all the works that were done under the sun, + and, look! everything was vanity and a striving after wind. * + 15 That which is made crooked cannot be made straight, + and that which is wanting cannot possibly be counted. 16 I, even I, spoke with my heart, + saying: “Look! I myself have greatly increased in wisdom more than anyone that happened to be before me in Jerusalem, + and my own heart saw a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.” + 17 And I proceeded to give my heart to knowing wisdom and to knowing madness, + and I have come to know folly, + that this too is a striving after wind. * + 18 For in the abundance of wisdom there is an abundance of vexation, + so that he that increases knowledge increases pain. + Footnotes ^ Or, “assembler; convener; convoker,” M; LXXVg, “Ecclesiastes,” that is, a member of an ecclesia (congregation; assembly). ^ “The greatest vanity!” Lit., “Vanity of vanities,” M(Heb., havelʹ hava·limʹ )LXXSyVg. ^ Lit., “to an earthling man .” Heb., la· ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “ Under the sun .” Heb., ta·chathʹ hash· shaʹmesh .
