Then he burned the high place; he ground [it] to dust * and burned the sacred pole. 16 When Jo·siʹah * turned, he got to see the burial places that were there in the mountain. So he sent and took the bones from the burial places and burned + them upon the altar, that he might make it unfit for worship, according to Jehovah’s * word + that the man of the [true] God had proclaimed, + who proclaimed these things. 17 Then he said: “What is the gravestone over there that I am seeing?” At this the men of the city said to him: “It is the burial + place of the man of the [true] God that came from Judah + and proceeded to proclaim these things that you have done against the altar of Bethʹel.” + 18 So he said: “Let him rest. + Do not let anyone disturb his bones.” Consequently they let his bones alone along with the bones of the prophet + that had come from Sa·marʹi·a. 19 And also all the houses + of the high places that were in the cities + of Sa·marʹi·a that the kings + of Israel had built to cause offense * + Jo·siʹah removed, and he went on to do to them according to all the doings that he had done at Bethʹel. + 20 Accordingly he sacrificed all the priests + of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned human bones upon them. + After that he returned to Jerusalem. 21 The king now commanded all the people, saying: “Hold a passover + to Jehovah * YOUR God according to what is written in this book of the covenant.” + 22 For no passover like this had been held from the days of the judges that had judged Israel, + nor all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. + 23 But in the eighteenth year of King Jo·siʹah this passover was held to Jehovah * in Jerusalem. + 24 And also the spirit mediums + and the professional foretellers + of events and the teraphim * + and the dungy idols + and all the disgusting + things that had appeared in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem Jo·siʹah cleared out, in order that he might actually carry out the words of the law + that were written in the book + that Hil·kiʹah the priest had found at the house of Jehovah. + 25 And like him there did not prove to be a king prior to him who returned + to Jehovah * with all his heart and with all his soul + and with all his vital force, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him has there risen up one like him. 26 Nevertheless, Jehovah * did not turn back from the great burning of his anger, with which his anger burned against Judah + over all the offensive things with which Ma·nasʹseh had made them offend. + 27 But Jehovah * said: “Judah, + too, I shall remove from my sight, + just as I have removed Israel; + and I shall certainly reject this city that I have chosen, even Jerusalem, and the house of which I have said, ‘My name will continue there.’” + 28 As for the rest of the affairs of Jo·siʹah and all that he did, are they not written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Judah? 29 In his days Pharʹaoh Neʹchoh * + the king of Egypt came up to the king of As·syrʹi·a * by the river Eu·phraʹtes, + and King Jo·siʹah proceeded to go to meet him; + but he put him to death + at Me·gidʹdo + as soon as he saw him. 30 So his servants conveyed him dead in a chariot from Me·gidʹdo and brought him to Jerusalem + and buried him in his grave. Then the people of the land took Je·hoʹa·haz + the son of Jo·siʹah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. 31 Twenty-three years old was Je·hoʹa·haz + when he began to reign, and for three months he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Ha·muʹtal + the daughter of Jeremiah from Libʹnah. 32 And he began to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that forefathers of his had done. + 33 And Pharʹaoh Neʹchoh + got to put him in bonds + at Ribʹlah + in the land of Haʹmath, to keep him from reigning * in Jerusalem, and then imposed a fine + upon the land of a hundred silver + talents * and a gold talent. + 34 Furthermore, Pharʹaoh Neʹchoh made E·liʹa·kim + the son of Jo·siʹah king in place of Jo·siʹah his father and changed his name to Je·hoiʹa·kim; and Je·hoʹa·haz he took and then brought to Egypt, where he eventually died. + 35 And the silver + and the gold Je·hoiʹa·kim gave to Pharʹaoh. Only he taxed + the land, to give the silver at the order of Pharʹaoh. According to each one’s individual tax + rate he exacted the silver and the gold from the people of the land, to give it to Pharʹaoh Neʹchoh. 36 Twenty-five years old was Je·hoiʹa·kim + when he began to reign, and for eleven years he reigned in Jerusalem. + And his mother’s name was Ze·biʹdah the daughter of Pe·daiʹah from Ruʹmah. 37 And he continued to do what was bad + in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that forefathers of his had done. + Footnotes ^ Or, “reminders.” ^ “The foreign - god priests .” Heb., hak· kema·rimʹ . ^ Possibly, “goat-shaped demons,” by a slight change in M.
