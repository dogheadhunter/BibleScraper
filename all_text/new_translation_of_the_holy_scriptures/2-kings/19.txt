You yourself have heard what the kings of As·syrʹi·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction; + and will you yourself be delivered? + 12 Have the gods + of the nations that my forefathers brought to ruin delivered them, even Goʹzan + and Haʹran + and Reʹzeph and the sons of Eʹden + that were in Tel-asʹsar? + 13 Where is he—the king of Haʹmath + and the king of Arʹpad + and the king of the cities of Seph·ar·vaʹim, Heʹna and Ivʹvah?’” + 14 Then Hez·e·kiʹah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them, + after which Hez·e·kiʹah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it out before Jehovah. + 15 And Hez·e·kiʹah began to pray + before Jehovah and say: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, + sitting upon the cherubs, + you alone are the [true] God of all the kingdoms + of the earth. + You yourself have made the heavens + and the earth. + 16 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear. + Open your eyes, + O Jehovah, and see, and hear the words of Sen·nachʹer·ib that he has sent to taunt + the living God. * 17 It is a fact, O Jehovah, the kings of As·syrʹi·a have devastated the nations and their land. + 18 And they have consigned their gods to the fire, because they were no gods, * + but the workmanship of man’s hands, + wood and stone; so that they destroyed them. 19 And now, O Jehovah our God, + save us, + please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone.” + 20 And Isaiah the son of Aʹmoz proceeded to send to Hez·e·kiʹah, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, + ‘The prayer + that you have made to me concerning Sen·nachʹer·ib the king of As·syrʹi·a I have heard. + 21 This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him: “The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you, + she has held you in derision. + Behind you the daughter of Jerusalem + has wagged her head. + 22 Whom have you taunted + and spoken of abusively? + And against whom have you lifted up your voice + And do you raise your eyes on high? + It is against the Holy One of Israel! + 23 By means of your messengers + you have taunted Jehovah * and you say, + ‘With the multitude * of my war chariots I myself + — I shall certainly ascend the height of mountainous regions, + The remotest parts of Lebʹa·non; + And I shall cut down its lofty cedars, + its choice juniper trees. + And I will enter its final lodging place, the forest of its orchard. + 24 I myself shall certainly dig and drink strange waters, And I shall dry up with the soles of my feet all the Nile canals of Egypt.’ + 25 Have you not heard? + From remote times it is what I will do. + From bygone days I have even formed it. + Now I will bring it in. + And you will serve to make fortified cities desolate as piles of ruins. + 26 And their inhabitants will be feeble-handed; + They will simply be terrified and will be ashamed. + They must become as vegetation of the field and green tender grass, + Grass of the roofs, + when there is a scorching before the east wind. + 27 And your sitting quiet and your going out + and your coming in I well know, + And your exciting yourself against me, + 28 Because your exciting yourself against me + and your roaring have come up into my ears. + And I shall certainly put my hook in your nose and my bridle between your lips, + And I shall indeed lead you back by the way by which you have come.” + 29 “‘And this will be the sign for you: + There will be an eating * this year of the growth from spilled kernels, + and in the second year grain that shoots up of itself; but in the third year sow seed, + you people, and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. + 30 And those who escape of the house of Judah, those who are left, + will certainly take root downward and produce fruitage upward. + 31 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, + and those who escape from Mount Zion. + The very zeal + of Jehovah of armies * will do this. 32 “‘That is why this is what Jehovah has said concerning the king of As·syrʹi·a: + “He will not come into this city + nor will he shoot an arrow + there nor confront it with a shield nor cast up a siege rampart + against it. 33 By the way by which he proceeded to come, he will return, and into this city he will not come, is the utterance of Jehovah. + 34 And I shall certainly defend + this city to save it for my own + sake and for the sake of David my servant.”’” + 35 And it came about on that night that the angel of Jehovah proceeded to go out and strike down a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp + of the As·syrʹi·ans. + When people rose up early in the morning, why, there all of them were dead carcasses. + 36 Therefore Sen·nachʹer·ib + the king of As·syrʹi·a pulled away and went and returned, + and he took up dwelling in Ninʹe·veh. + 37 And it came about that as he was bowing down at the house of Nisʹroch + his god, * + A·dramʹme·lech and Shar·eʹzer, his sons, * themselves struck him down with the sword, + and they themselves escaped to the land of Arʹa·rat. * + And Eʹsar-hadʹdon + his son began to reign in place of him.
