There proved to be nothing that Hez·e·kiʹah did not show them in his own house and in all his dominion. + 14 After that Isaiah the prophet came in to King Hez·e·kiʹah and said to him: + “What did these men say and from where did they proceed to come to you?” + So Hez·e·kiʹah said: “From a distant land they came, from Babylon.” 15 And he went on to say: “What did they see in your house?” To this Hez·e·kiʹah said: “Everything that is in my house they saw. There proved to be nothing that I did not show them in my treasures.” + 16 Isaiah now said to Hez·e·kiʹah: “Hear the word of Jehovah, + 17 ‘“Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house + and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon. + Nothing will be left,” + Jehovah has said. 18 “And some of your own sons that will come forth from you to whom you will become father will themselves be taken + and actually become court officials + in the palace * of the king of Babylon.”’” + 19 At that Hez·e·kiʹah said to Isaiah: “The word of Jehovah that you have spoken is good.” + And he went on to say: “Is it not so, if peace and truth + themselves will continue in my own days?” + 20 As for the rest of the affairs of Hez·e·kiʹah and all his mightiness and how he made the pool + and the conduit + and then brought the water into the city, are they not written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Judah? 21 Finally Hez·e·kiʹah lay down with his forefathers; + and Ma·nasʹseh + his son began to reign in place of him.
