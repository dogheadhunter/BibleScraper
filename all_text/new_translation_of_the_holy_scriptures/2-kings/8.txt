Accordingly the report was made to him, saying: “The man of the [true] God + has come as far as here.” 8 At that the king said to Hazʹa·el: + “Take a gift + in your hand and go and meet the man of the [true] God, and you must inquire + of Jehovah through him, saying, ‘Shall I revive from this sickness?’” 9 So Hazʹa·el went to meet him and took a gift in his hand, even every sort of good thing of Damascus, the load of forty camels, and came and stood before him and said: “Your son, + Ben-haʹdad, the king of Syria, has sent me to you, saying, ‘Shall I revive from this sickness?’” 10 Then E·liʹsha said to him: “Go, say to him, ‘You will * positively revive,’ and Jehovah has shown me + that he will positively die.” + 11 And he kept a fixed look and kept it set to the point of embarrassment. Then the man of the [true] God gave way to weeping. + 12 At this Hazʹa·el said: “Why is my lord weeping?” To this he said: “Because I well know what injury + you will do to the sons of Israel. Their fortified places you will consign to the fire, and their choice men you will kill with the sword, and their children you will dash to pieces, + and their pregnant women you will rip up.” + 13 Upon that Hazʹa·el said: “What is your servant, [who is a mere] dog, + that he could do this great thing?” But E·liʹsha said: “Jehovah has shown me you as king over Syria.” + 14 After that he went from E·liʹsha and came to his own lord, who then said to him: “What did E·liʹsha say to you?” To this he said: “He said to me, ‘You will positively revive.’” + 15 And it came about on the next day that he proceeded to take a coverlet * and dip * it in water and spread it out over his face, + so that he died. + And Hazʹa·el + began to reign in place of him. 16 And in the fifth year of Je·hoʹram * + the son of Aʹhab the king of Israel, while Je·hoshʹa·phat was king of Judah, Je·hoʹram + the son of Je·hoshʹa·phat the king of Judah became king. 17 Thirty-two years old he happened to be when he became king, and for eight years he reigned in Jerusalem. + 18 And he went walking in the way of the kings of Israel, + just as those of the house of Aʹhab had done; + for it was Aʹhab’s daughter that became his wife, + and he kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. 19 And Jehovah did not want to bring Judah + to ruin for the sake of David his servant, + just as he had promised him to give a lamp + to him [and] to his sons * always. * 20 In his days Eʹdom + revolted from under the hand of Judah, and then made a king + reign over them. 21 Consequently Je·hoʹram passed over to Zaʹir, also all the chariots with him. And it came about that he himself rose up by night and got to strike down the Eʹdom·ites that were surrounding him and the chiefs of the chariots; and the people went fleeing to their tents. 22 But Eʹdom kept up its revolt from under the hand of Judah down to this day. It was then that Libʹnah * + began to revolt at that time. 23 And the rest of the affairs of Je·hoʹram and all that he did, are they not written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Judah? 24 Finally Je·hoʹram lay down with his forefathers + and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David. + And A·ha·ziʹah * + his son began to reign in place of him. 25 In the twelfth year of Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab the king of Israel, A·ha·ziʹah the son of Je·hoʹram the king of Judah became king. + 26 Twenty-two years old was A·ha·ziʹah when he began to reign, and for one year he reigned in Jerusalem. + And his mother’s name was Ath·a·liʹah + the granddaughter * of Omʹri + the king of Israel. 27 And he went walking in the way of the house of Aʹhab + and kept doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, + like the house of Aʹhab, for he was a relative of the house of Aʹhab by marriage. + 28 Accordingly he went with Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab to the war against Hazʹa·el + the king of Syria at Raʹmoth-gilʹe·ad, + but the Syrians struck + down Je·hoʹram. 29 So Je·hoʹram + the king returned to get healed at Jezʹre·el + from the wounds that the Syrians got to inflict upon him at Raʹmah * when he fought Hazʹa·el the king of Syria. As for A·ha·ziʹah + the son of Je·hoʹram the king of Judah, he went down to see Je·hoʹram the son of Aʹhab in Jezʹre·el, for he was sick.
