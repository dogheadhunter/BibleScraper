In turn Je·hoʹash was buried in Sa·marʹi·a with the kings of Israel. + 14 As regards E·liʹsha, + he had taken sick with the sickness with which he was to die. + So Je·hoʹash the king of Israel came down to him and began to weep over his face and say: “My father, + my father, the war chariot * of Israel and his horsemen!” + 15 And E·liʹsha proceeded to say to him: “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took to himself a bow and arrows. 16 And he went on to say to the king of Israel: “Put your hand to the bow.” * Accordingly he put his hand to it, after which E·liʹsha laid his hands upon the hands + of the king. 17 Then he said: “Open the window to the east.” So he opened it. Finally E·liʹsha said: “Shoot!” So he shot. He now said: “Jehovah’s arrow of salvation, even the arrow of salvation + against Syria! And you will certainly strike down Syria at Aʹphek + to the finishing point.” 18 And he went on to say: “Take the arrows.” At that he took [them]. Then he said to the king of Israel: “Strike on the earth.” So he struck three times and stopped. + 19 And the man of the [true] God + grew indignant at him; hence he said: “It was meant to strike five or six times! * In that case you would certainly be striking down Syria to the finishing point, but now it is three times that you will strike down Syria.” + 20 After that E·liʹsha died and they buried him. + And there were marauding bands + of the Moʹab·ites + that regularly came into the land at the coming in of the year. 21 And it came about that as they were burying a man, why, here they saw the marauding band. At once they threw the man into E·liʹsha’s burial place and went off. When the man touched the bones of E·liʹsha, he immediately came to life + and stood upon his feet. + 22 As for Hazʹa·el + the king of Syria, he oppressed + Israel all the days of Je·hoʹa·haz. 23 However, Jehovah showed them favor + and had mercy + upon them and turned to them for the sake of his covenant + with Abraham, + Isaac + and Jacob; + and he did not want to bring them to ruin, + and he did not cast them away from before his face until now. 24 Finally Hazʹa·el the king of Syria died, and Ben-haʹdad his son began to reign in place of him. 25 And Je·hoʹash the son of Je·hoʹa·haz proceeded to take back again from the hand of Ben-haʹdad the son of Hazʹa·el the cities that he had taken from the hand of Je·hoʹa·haz his father in war. Three times Je·hoʹash struck him down, and he got to recover the cities of Israel. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “tents.” ^ Or, “the Asherah.” ^ That is, Jeroboam II. ^ See 2:12 ftn. ^ Lit., “Make your hand ride upon the bow.” ^ “If you had struck five or six times,” LXX; Vg, “If you had struck five or six or seven times.” Previous Next Print Share Share
