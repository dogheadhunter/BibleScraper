All its pregnant women he ripped up. + 17 In the thirty-ninth + year of Az·a·riʹah * the king of Judah, Menʹa·hem the son of Gaʹdi became king over Israel for ten years in Sa·marʹi·a. 18 And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. + He did not depart from all the sins of Jer·o·boʹam + the son of Neʹbat, with which he caused Israel to sin, + all his days. 19 Pul + the king of As·syrʹi·a + came into the land. Consequently Menʹa·hem gave + Pul a thousand talents of silver, + that his hands might prove to be with him to strengthen the kingdom in his own hand. + 20 So Menʹa·hem brought forth the silver at the expense of Israel, at the expense of all the valiant, mighty men, + to give to the king of As·syrʹi·a fifty silver shekels * for each man. At that the king of As·syrʹi·a turned back, and he did not stay there in the land. 21 As for the rest of the affairs of Menʹa·hem + and all that he did, are they not written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel? 22 Finally Menʹa·hem lay down with his forefathers, and Pek·a·hiʹah + his son began to reign in place of him. 23 In the fiftieth year of Az·a·riʹah the king of Judah, Pek·a·hiʹah the son of Menʹa·hem became king over Israel in Sa·marʹi·a for two + years. 24 And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. + He did not depart from the sins of Jer·o·boʹam + the son of Neʹbat, with which he caused Israel to sin. + 25 Then Peʹkah + the son of Rem·a·liʹah * his adjutant + conspired + against him and struck him down in Sa·marʹi·a in the dwelling tower of the king’s house + with Arʹgob and A·riʹeh, and with him there were fifty men of the sons of Gilʹe·ad. * So he put him to death and began to reign in place of him. 26 As for the rest of the affairs of Pek·a·hiʹah and all that he did, there they are written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel. 27 In the fifty-second year of Az·a·riʹah the king of Judah, Peʹkah + the son of Rem·a·liʹah + became king over Israel in Sa·marʹi·a for twenty years. 28 And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. + He did not depart from the sins of Jer·o·boʹam + the son of Neʹbat, with which he caused Israel to sin. + 29 In the days of Peʹkah the king of Israel, Tigʹlath-pil·eʹser + the king of As·syrʹi·a + came in and proceeded to take Iʹjon + and Aʹbel-beth-maʹa·cah + and Ja·noʹah and Keʹdesh + and Haʹzor + and Gilʹe·ad + and Galʹi·lee, * + all the land of Naphʹta·li, + and to carry them into exile in As·syrʹi·a. + 30 Finally Ho·sheʹa + the son of Eʹlah formed a conspiracy + against Peʹkah the son of Rem·a·liʹah and struck him + and put him to death; and he began to reign in place of him in the twentieth year of Joʹtham + the son of Uz·ziʹah. * 31 As for the rest of the affairs of Peʹkah and all that he did, there they are written in the book + of the affairs of the days of the kings of Israel. 32 In the second year of Peʹkah the son of Rem·a·liʹah the king of Israel, Joʹtham + the son of Uz·ziʹah + the king of Judah became king. 33 Twenty-five years old he happened to be when he began to reign, and for sixteen years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Je·ruʹsha the daughter of Zaʹdok. + 34 And he continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes. + According to all that Uz·ziʹah his father had done, he did. + 35 It was only that the high places did not disappear. The people were still sacrificing and making sacrificial smoke on the high places. + He it was that built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah. + 36 As for the rest of the affairs of Joʹtham, what he did, are they not written in the book of the affairs of the days of the kings of Judah? + 37 In those days Jehovah started to send + against Judah Reʹzin + the king of Syria and Peʹkah + the son of Rem·a·liʹah. 38 Finally Joʹtham lay down with his forefathers and was buried with his forefathers in the City of David his forefather; + and Aʹhaz + his son began to reign in place of him.
