But on account of the chosen + ones whom he has chosen + he has cut short the days. + 21 “Then, too, if anyone says to YOU , ‘See! Here is the Christ,’ ‘See! There he is,’ + do not believe [it]. + 22 For false Christs and false prophets will arise + and will give signs and wonders + to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones. + 23 Y OU , then, watch + out; I have told YOU all things beforehand. + 24 “But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, 25 and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. + 26 And then they will see the Son of man + coming * in clouds with great power and glory. + 27 And then he will send forth the angels and will gather his chosen + ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity. + 28 “Now from the fig tree learn the illustration: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and puts forth its leaves, YOU know that summer is near. + 29 Likewise also YOU , when YOU see these things happening, know that he is near, at the doors. + 30 Truly I say to YOU that this generation * will by no means pass away until all these things happen. + 31 Heaven + and earth will pass away, but my words + will not pass away. + 32 “Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. + 33 Keep looking, keep awake, + for YOU do not know when the appointed time is. + 34 It is like a man traveling abroad + that left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. 35 Therefore keep on the watch, + for YOU do not know when the master of the house is coming, whether late in the day * or at midnight * or at cockcrowing * or early in the morning; * + 36 in order that when he arrives suddenly, he does not find YOU sleeping. + 37 But what I say to YOU I say to all, Keep on the watch.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “joint end.” See Mt 13:39 ftn, “Conclusion.” ^ Or, “accomplished end; completed end; finish.” Gr., τέλος ( teʹlos ). ^ Or, “be stirred up; be roused up.” ^ “Earthquakes.” Gr., sei·smoiʹ . ^ “A witness.” Gr., mar·tyʹri·on; Lat., te·sti·moʹni·um . ^ Or, “to Lesser Sanhedrins.” ^ Or, “to be heralded.” Gr., ke·ry·khtheʹnai; Lat., prae·di·caʹri .
