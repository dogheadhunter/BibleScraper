And they led him out to impale him. * + 21 Also, they impressed into service a passerby, a certain Simon of Cy·reʹne, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Ruʹfus, that he should lift up his torture stake. * + 22 So they brought him to the place Golʹgo·tha, which means, when translated, Skull Place. * + 23 Here they tried to give him wine drugged with myrrh, + but he would not take it. + 24 And they impaled him and distributed his outer garments + by casting the lot over them as to who takes what. + 25 It was now the third hour, * + and they impaled him. 26 And the inscription of the charge + against him was written above, “The King of the Jews.” + 27 Moreover, they impaled two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. + 28 * —— 29 And those going by would speak abusively + to him, wagging their heads and saying: “Bah! You would-be thrower-down of the temple * and builder of it in three days’ time, + 30 save yourself by coming down off the torture stake.” + 31 In like manner also the chief priests were making fun among themselves with the scribes and saying: “Others he saved; himself he cannot save! + 32 Let the Christ the King of Israel now come down off the torture stake, that we may see and believe.” + Even those impaled together with him were reproaching him. + 33 When it became the sixth hour * a darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour. * + 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice: “Eʹli, Eʹli, laʹma sa·bach·thaʹni?” * which means, when translated: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” + 35 And some of those standing near, on hearing it, began to say: “See! He is calling E·liʹjah.” * + 36 But a certain one ran, soaked a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and began giving him a drink, + saying: “L ET [him] be! Let us see whether E·liʹjah comes to take him down.” + 37 But Jesus let out a loud cry and expired. + 38 And the curtain + of the sanctuary * was rent in two from top to bottom. + 39 Now, when the army officer * that was standing by with him in view saw he had expired under these circumstances, he said: “Certainly this man was God’s Son.” * + 40 There were also women viewing from a distance, + among them Mary Magʹda·lene as well as Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joʹses, * and Sa·loʹme, + 41 who used to accompany him + and minister to him when he was in Galʹi·lee, and many other women who had come up together with him to Jerusalem. + 42 Now as it was already late in the afternoon, and since it was Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 43 there came Joseph of Ar·i·ma·theʹa, a reputable member of the Council, who also himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. + He took courage to go in before Pilate and asked for the body + of Jesus. 44 But Pilate wondered whether he was already dead, and, summoning the army officer, he asked him whether he had already died. 45 So after making certain from the army officer, he granted the corpse to Joseph. + 46 Accordingly he bought fine linen and took him down, wrapped him in the fine linen and laid him + in a tomb + which was quarried out of a rock-mass; and he rolled a stone up to the door of the memorial tomb. + 47 But Mary Magʹda·lene and Mary the mother of Joʹses * continued looking at where he had been laid. + Footnotes ^ Or, “Fasten him on a stake (pole).” See App 5C . ^ See vs 13 ftn. ^ See App 5C . ^ “Skull Place.” Gr., Kra·niʹou Toʹpos; Lat., Cal·vaʹri·ae loʹcus . ^ “Third hour,” that is, about 9 a.m. ^ א ABCD omit; VgSy h,p , “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘And he was reckoned with lawless ones.’ ” ^ See 14:58 ftn. ^ “Sixth hour,” that is, about 12 noon. ^ “Ninth hour,” that is, about 3 p.m. ^ “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” Compare Ps 22:1 ftn, “Me.” ^ Meaning “My God Is Jehovah.” J 17,​18 (Heb.), ʼE·li·yaʹhu . ^ See 14:58 ftn. ^ Or, “centurion.” Gr., ken·ty·riʹon; an officer in command of 100 soldiers. ^ Or, “a son of God”; or, “a son of a god.” ^ “Joses,” א * ACSy h,p ; א c BD, “Josetos”; ItVgSy s , “Joseph.” ^ “Joses,” CSy h,p ; א c B, “Josetos”; AVg, “Joseph.” Previous Next Print Share Share
