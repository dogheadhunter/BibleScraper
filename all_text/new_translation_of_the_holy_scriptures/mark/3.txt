Your mother and your brothers outside are seeking you.” + 33 But in reply he said to them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?” + 34 And having looked about upon those sitting around him in a circle, he said: “See, my mother and my brothers! + 35 Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “a life.” Gr., psy·khenʹ; Lat., aʹni·mam; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), neʹphesh .
