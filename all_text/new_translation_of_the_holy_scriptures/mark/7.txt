And many things + similar to this YOU do.” 14 So, calling the crowd to him again, he proceeded to say to them: “Listen to me, all of YOU , and get the meaning. + 15 There is nothing from outside a man that passes into him that can defile him; but the things that issue forth out of a man are the things that defile a man.” + 16 * —— 17 Now when he had entered a house away from the crowd, his disciples began to question him respecting the illustration. + 18 So he said to them: “Are YOU also without perception like them? + Are YOU not aware that nothing from outside that passes into a man can defile him, 19 since it passes, not into [his] heart, but into [his] intestines, and it passes out into the sewer?” * + Thus he declared all foods clean. * + 20 Further, he said: “That which issues forth out of a man is what defiles a man; + 21 for from inside, out of the heart of men, + injurious reasonings issue forth: fornications, * + thieveries, murders, + 22 adulteries, covetings, + acts of wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, * + an envious eye, * blasphemy, haughtiness, unreasonableness. 23 All these wicked things issue forth from within and defile a man.” + 24 From there he rose up and went into the regions of Tyre and Siʹdon. + And he entered into a house and did not want anyone to get to know it. Yet he could not escape notice; + 25 but immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and prostrated herself at his feet. + 26 The woman was a Grecian, a Sy·ro·phoe·niʹcian nationally; and she kept asking him to expel the demon from her daughter. + 27 But he began by saying to her: “First let the children be satisfied, for it is not right to take the bread of the children + and throw it to the little dogs.” + 28 In reply, however, she said to him: “Yes, sir, and yet the little dogs underneath the table eat of the crumbs + of the little children.” + 29 At that he said to her: “Because of saying this, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.” + 30 So she went away to her home and found + the young child laid on the bed and the demon gone out. 31 Now coming back out of the regions of Tyre he went through Siʹdon to the sea of Galʹi·lee up through the midst of the regions of De·capʹo·lis. * + 32 Here they brought him a man deaf and with a speech impediment, and they entreated him to lay his hand upon him. + 33 And he took him away from the crowd privately and put his fingers into the man’s ears and, after spitting, he touched his tongue. + 34 And with a look up into heaven + he sighed + deeply and said to him: “Ephʹpha·tha,” that is, “Be opened.” 35 Well, his hearing powers were opened, + and the impediment * of his tongue was loosed, and he began speaking normally. 36 With that he charged them not to tell anyone; + but the more he would charge them, that much more they would proclaim it. + 37 Indeed, they were being astounded + in a most extraordinary way and they said: “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the speechless speak.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “wash their hands with the fist.” ^ Or, “die without fail.” ^ Gr., Kor·banʹ; Lat., corʹban; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), qor·banʹ .
