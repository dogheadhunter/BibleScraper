He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?” + 8 But Jesus, having discerned immediately by his spirit that they were reasoning that way in themselves, said to them: “Why are YOU reasoning these things in YOUR hearts? + 9 Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and pick up your cot and walk’? + 10 But in order for YOU men to know that the Son of man + has authority to forgive sins upon the earth,” + —he said to the paralytic: 11 “I say to you, Get up, pick up your cot, and go to your home.” + 12 At that he did get up, and immediately picked up his cot and walked out in front of them all, + so that they were all simply carried away, and they glorified God, saying: “We never saw the like of it.” + 13 Again he went out beside the sea; and all the crowd kept coming to him, and he began to teach them. 14 But as he was passing along, he caught sight of Leʹvi + the [son] of Al·phaeʹus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: “Be my follower.” And rising up he followed him. + 15 Later he happened to be reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors + and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many of them and they began following him. + 16 But the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, began saying to his disciples: “Does he eat with the tax collectors and sinners?” + 17 Upon hearing this Jesus said to them: “Those who are strong do not need a physician, but those who are ill do. I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.” + 18 Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees practiced fasting. So they came and said to him: “Why is it the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees practice fasting, but your disciples do not practice fasting?” + 19 And Jesus said to them: “While the bridegroom is with them the friends of the bridegroom * cannot fast, + can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. + 20 But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. + 21 Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old outer garment; if he does, its full strength pulls from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. + 22 Also, nobody puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. + But people put new wine into new wineskins.” + 23 Now it happened that he was proceeding through the grainfields on the sabbath, and his disciples started to make their way plucking + the heads of grain. + 24 So the Pharisees went saying to him: “Look here! Why are they doing on the sabbath what is not lawful?” + 25 But he said to them: “Have YOU never once read what David + did when he fell in need and got hungry, he and the men with him? + 26 How he entered into the house of God, in the account about A·biʹa·thar + the chief priest, * and ate the loaves of presentation, * + which it is not lawful + for anybody to eat except the priests, and he gave some also to the men who were with him?” + 27 So he went on to say to them: “The sabbath came into existence for the sake of man, + and not man for the sake of the sabbath; + 28 hence the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “him.” ^ Lit., “the sons of the bridechamber.” ^ “In the account about Abiathar the chief priest.” Lit., “upon (at) Abiathar chief priest.” DWIt mss Sy s , Mt 12:4 and Lu 6:4 omit.
