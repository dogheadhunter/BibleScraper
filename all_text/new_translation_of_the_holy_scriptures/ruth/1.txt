Eventually they came to the fields of Moʹab and continued there. 3 In time E·limʹe·lech the husband of Naʹo·mi died, so that she remained with her two sons. 4 Later the men took wives for themselves, Moʹab·ite women. + The name of the one was Orʹpah, and the name of the other Ruth. + And they went on dwelling there for about ten years. 5 In time the two of them, Mahʹlon * and Chilʹi·on, * also died, so that the woman remained without her two children and her husband. 6 And she proceeded to get up with her daughters-in-law and to return from the fields of Moʹab, for she had heard in the field of Moʹab that Jehovah had turned his attention to * his people + by giving them bread. + 7 And she went her way out from the place where she had continued, + and both of her daughters-in-law were with her, and they kept walking on the road to return to the land of Judah. 8 Finally Naʹo·mi said to both of her daughters-in-law: “Go, return, each one to the house of her mother. May Jehovah exercise loving-kindness * toward YOU , + just as YOU have exercised it toward the men now dead and toward me. + 9 May Jehovah make a gift + to YOU , and do YOU find a resting-place + each one in the house of her husband.” Then she kissed + them, and they began to raise their voices and weep. 10 And they kept saying to her: “No, but with you we shall return to your people.” + 11 But Naʹo·mi said: “Return, my daughters. Why should YOU go with me? Do I still have sons in my inward parts, and will they have to become YOUR husbands? + 12 Return, my daughters, go, for I have grown too old to get to belong to a husband. If I had said I had hope also that I should certainly become a husband’s tonight and also should certainly bear sons, + 13 would YOU keep waiting for them * until they could grow up? Would YOU keep yourselves secluded for them so as not to become a husband’s? No, my daughters, for it is very bitter to me because of YOU , that the hand of Jehovah has gone out against me.” + 14 At that they raised their voices and wept some more, after which Orʹpah kissed her mother-in-law. As for Ruth, she stuck with her. + 15 So she said: “Look! Your widowed sister-in-law * has returned to her people and her gods. + Return with your widowed sister-in-law.” + 16 And Ruth proceeded to say: “Do not plead with me to abandon you, to turn back from accompanying you; * for where you go I shall go, and where you spend the night I shall spend the night. + Your people will be my people, + and your God my God. + 17 Where you die I shall die, + and there is where I shall be buried. May Jehovah do so to me and add + to it if anything but death should make a separation between me and you.” 18 When she got to see that she was persistent about going with her, + then she left off speaking to her. 19 And they both continued on their way until they came to Bethʹle·hem. + And it came about that as soon as they came to Bethʹle·hem, all the city became stirred up over them, + and the women kept saying: “Is this Naʹo·mi?” + 20 And she would say to the women: “Do not call me Naʹo·mi. * Call me Maʹra, * for the Almighty * + has made it very bitter for me. + 21 I was full when I went, + and it is empty-handed that Jehovah has made me return. + Why should YOU call me Naʹo·mi, when it is Jehovah that has humiliated me + and the Almighty that has caused me calamity?” + 22 Thus Naʹo·mi made her return, Ruth the Moʹab·ite woman, her daughter-in-law, being with her when returning from the fields of Moʹab; + and they came to Bethʹle·hem + at the commencement of barley harvest. + Footnotes ^ Meaning “God Is King.” ^ Or, “inhabitants of Ephrath.” See Ge 35:16, 19 . ^ Meaning “Sickly; Invalid.” ^ Meaning “Frailty.” ^ Or, “had visited.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Them,” masc., LXXSyVg. ^ That is, the widow of the brother of a wife’s husband.
