Boʹaz came from Bethʹle·hem and proceeded to say to the harvesters: “Jehovah be with YOU .” + In turn they would say to him: “Jehovah bless you.” + 5 Subsequently Boʹaz + said to the young man who was set over the harvesters: “To whom does this young woman belong?” 6 So the young man set over the harvesters answered and said: “The young woman is a Moʹab·i·tess, + who returned with Naʹo·mi from the field of Moʹab. + 7 Then she said, ‘Let me glean, + please, and I shall certainly gather among the cut-off ears of grain behind the harvesters.’ So she entered and kept on her feet from that time in the morning until her sitting down just now in the house a little while.” + 8 Later Boʹaz said to Ruth: “You have heard, have you not, my daughter? Do not go away to glean in another field, + and you must also not cross over from this place, and in that way you should keep close by my young women. + 9 Let your eyes be on the field that they will harvest, and you must go with them. Have I not commanded the young men not to touch + you? When you are thirsty, you must also go to the vessels and drink from what the young men will draw.” + 10 At that she fell upon her face and bowed down to the earth + and said to him: “How is it I have found favor in your eyes so that I am taken notice of, when I am a foreigner?” + 11 Then Boʹaz answered and said to her: “The report + was fully made to me of all that you have done to your mother-in-law after the death of your husband, + and how you proceeded to leave your father and your mother and the land of your relatives and to go to a people whom you had not known formerly. + 12 May Jehovah reward the way you act, + and may there come to be a perfect wage + for you from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.” + 13 To this she said: “Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, because you have comforted me and because you have spoken reassuringly to * your maidservant, + although I myself may not happen to be like one of your maidservants.” + 14 And Boʹaz proceeded to say to her at mealtime: “Approach here, and you must eat some of the bread + and dip your piece in the vinegar.” So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he would hold out roasted grain + to her and she would eat, so that she was satisfied and yet had something left over. 15 Then she got up to glean. + Boʹaz now commanded his young men, saying: “Let her glean also among the cut-off ears of grain, and YOU must not molest + her. 16 And YOU should also be sure to pull out some from the bundles of ears for her, and YOU must leave them behind that she may glean them, + and YOU must not rebuke her.” 17 And she continued to glean in the field until the evening, + after which she beat out + what she had gleaned, and it came to be about an eʹphah * + of barley. 18 Then she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law got to see * what she had gleaned. After that she took out what food she had left over + when she had satisfied herself and gave it to her. 19 Her mother-in-law now said to her: “Where did you glean today, and where did you work? May the one who took notice of you become blessed.” + So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked; and she went on to say: “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boʹaz.” 20 At that Naʹo·mi said to her daughter-in-law: “Blessed be he of Jehovah, + who has not left his loving-kindness + toward the living and the dead.” + And Naʹo·mi went on to say to her: “The man is related to us. + He is one of our repurchasers.” * + 21 Then Ruth the Moʹab·i·tess said: “He also said to me, ‘Close by the young people that are mine is where you should keep until they have finished the entire harvest that I have.’” + 22 So Naʹo·mi + said to Ruth her daughter-in-law: + “It is better, my daughter, that you should go out with his young women, that they may not annoy you in another field.” + 23 And she continued to keep close by the young women of Boʹaz to glean until the harvest of the barley + and the harvest of the wheat came to an end. And she kept on dwelling with her mother-in-law. + Footnotes ^ Possibly meaning “In Strength.” ^ Or, “acquaintance.” ^ Lit., “spoken to the heart of.” ^ About 22 L (20 dry qt). ^ “And her mother-in-law got to see,” MLXX; SyVg, “and showed her mother-in-law.” ^ Or, “one of our kinsmen with the right to repurchase ( redeem ).” Heb., mig· go·ʼal eʹnu, sing.; pl. in several Heb. mss.
