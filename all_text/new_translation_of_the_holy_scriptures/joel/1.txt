As for [the] pomegranate tree, also [the] palm tree and [the] apple tree, all the trees of the field, they have dried up; + for exultation has gone ashamed away from the sons of mankind. * + 13 “Gird yourselves, and beat YOUR breasts, + YOU priests. Howl, YOU ministers of [the] altar. + Come in, spend the night in sackcloth, YOU ministers of my God; * for from the house of YOUR God grain offering + and drink offering have been withheld. + 14 Sanctify a time of fasting. + Call together a solemn assembly. + Gather together [the] older men, all the inhabitants of the land, * to the house of Jehovah YOUR God, + and cry to Jehovah for aid. + 15 “Alas for the day; + because the day of Jehovah is near, + and like a despoiling from the Almighty One * it will come! 16 Has not food itself been cut off before our very eyes; from the house of our God, rejoicing and joyfulness? + 17 Dried figs * have shriveled under their shovels. Storehouses have been laid desolate. Barns * have been torn down, for [the] grain has dried up. 18 O how the domestic animal has sighed! [How] the droves of cattle have wandered in confusion! For there is no pasturage for them. + Also, the droves of the sheep have been the ones made to bear guilt. 19 “To you, O Jehovah, I shall call; + for fire itself has devoured the pasture grounds of [the] wilderness, and a very flame has consumed all the trees of the field. + 20 The beasts of the field also keep longing for you, + because the channels of water have dried up, + and fire itself has devoured the pasture grounds of the wilderness.” Footnotes ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ Or, “you elders .” Heb., haz· zeqe·nimʹ ; Gr., pre·sbyʹte·roi .
