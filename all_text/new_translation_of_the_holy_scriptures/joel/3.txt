And if YOU are giving such treatment to me, swiftly, speedily I shall pay back YOUR treatment upon YOUR heads. + 5 Because YOU men have taken my own silver and my own gold, + and YOU have brought my own desirable good things into YOUR temples; + 6 and the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem YOU have sold + to the sons of the Greeks, * + for the purpose of removing them far from their own territory; + 7 here I am arousing them [to come] from the place where YOU have sold them, + and I will pay back YOUR treatment upon YOUR own heads. + 8 And I will sell YOUR sons and YOUR daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, + and they must sell them to the men of Sheʹba, + to a nation far away; + for Jehovah himself has spoken [it]. 9 “Proclaim this, YOU people, among the nations, + ‘Sanctify war! Arouse the powerful men! * + Let them draw near! Let them come up, all the men * of war! + 10 Beat YOUR plowshares into swords and YOUR pruning shears + into lances. As for the weak one, let him say: “I am a powerful man.” + 11 Lend YOUR aid and come, all YOU nations round about, + and collect yourselves together.’” + To that place, O Jehovah, bring your powerful ones down. + 12 “Let the nations be aroused and come up to the low plain of Je·hoshʹa·phat; + for there I shall sit in order to judge all the nations round about. + 13 “T HRUST in a sickle, + for harvest has grown ripe. + Come, descend, for [the] winepress has become full. + The press vats actually overflow; for their badness has become abundant. + 14 Crowds, crowds are in the low plain of the decision, + for the day of Jehovah is near in the low plain of the decision. + 15 Sun and moon themselves will certainly become dark, and the very stars will actually withdraw their brightness. + 16 And out of Zion Jehovah himself will roar, and out of Jerusalem he will give forth his voice. + And heaven and earth certainly will rock; + but Jehovah will be a refuge for his people, + and a fortress for the sons of Israel. + 17 And YOU people will have to know that I am Jehovah YOUR God, + residing in Zion my holy mountain. + And Jerusalem must become a holy place; + and as regards strangers, they will no more pass through her. + 18 “And it must occur in that day that the mountains will drip with sweet wine, * + and the very hills will flow * with milk, and the very streambeds of Judah will all flow with water. And out of the house of Jehovah there will go forth a spring, + and it must irrigate the torrent valley of the Acacia Trees. * + 19 As regards Egypt, a desolate waste it will become; + and as regards Eʹdom, a wilderness of desolate waste it will become, + because of the violence to the sons of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood. + 20 But as for Judah, to time indefinite it will be inhabited, + and Jerusalem to generation after generation. + 21 And I will consider innocent their blood * that I had not considered innocent; * + and Jehovah will be residing in Zion.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “for the prostitute .” Heb., baz· zoh·nahʹ ; Gr., porʹnais ; Lat., in pro·stiʹbu·lum . ^ Lit., “what are you to me?” A Heb. idiom; a repellent question indicating objection to the “treatment.” See App 7B . ^ “The Greeks,” LXXVg; Heb., hai·Yewa·nimʹ, “the Ionians.” ^ See 2:7 ftn. ^ “Men of.” Heb., ʼan·shehʹ, pl. of ʼish . ^ Or, “fresh grape juice.” ^ Lit., “go.” ^ Or, “valley of Shittim.” ^ That is, death by bloodshed. ^ “And I will avenge their blood and by no means consider [them] innocent,” LXX; Vg, “And I will cleanse their blood that I had not cleansed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
