For this very cause keep on reproving them with severity, + that they may be healthy + in the faith, 14 paying no attention to Jewish fables + and commandments of men + who turn themselves away from the truth. + 15 All things are clean to clean [persons]. + But to [persons] defiled + and faithless + nothing is clean, but both their minds and their consciences + are defiled. 16 They publicly declare they know God, + but they disown him by their works, + because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved + for good work of any sort.
