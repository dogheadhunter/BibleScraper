Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound. + 10 On this account I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones, + that they too may obtain the salvation that is in union with Christ Jesus along with everlasting glory. + 11 Faithful is the saying: + Certainly if we died together, we shall also live together; + 12 if we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings; + if we deny, + he also will deny us; 13 if we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, + for he cannot deny himself. 14 Keep reminding + them of these things, charging + them before God * as witness, + not to fight about words, + a thing of no usefulness at all because it overturns those listening. 15 Do your utmost to present yourself approved + to God, a workman + with nothing to be ashamed of, + handling the word of the truth aright. + 16 But shun empty speeches that violate what is holy; + for they will advance to more and more ungodliness, * + 17 and their word will spread like gangrene. + Hy·me·naeʹus and Phi·leʹtus are of that number. + 18 These very [men] have deviated from the truth, + saying that the resurrection has already occurred; + and they are subverting the faith of some. + 19 For all that, the solid foundation * of God * stays standing, + having this seal: “Jehovah * knows those who belong to him,” + and: “Let everyone naming the name of Jehovah * + renounce unrighteousness.” + 20 Now in a large house there are vessels not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable purpose but others for a purpose lacking honor. + 21 If, therefore, anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, * he will be a vessel for an honorable purpose, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work. + 22 So, flee from the desires incidental to youth, * + but pursue righteousness, + faith, love, peace, + along with those who call upon the Lord * out of a clean heart. + 23 Further, turn down foolish and ignorant questionings, + knowing they produce fights. + 24 But a slave of the Lord * does not need to fight, + but needs to be gentle * toward all, + qualified to teach, + keeping himself restrained under evil, + 25 instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed; + as perhaps God may give them repentance + leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, + 26 and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare + of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive + by him for the will of that one.
