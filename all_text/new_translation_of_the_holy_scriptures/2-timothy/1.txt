This was given us in connection with Christ Jesus before times long lasting, * + 10 but now it has been made clearly evident through the manifestation + of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished * death + but has shed light + upon life + and incorruption + through the good news, + 11 for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher. + 12 For this very cause I am also suffering + these things, but I am not ashamed. + For I know the one whom I have believed, and I am confident * he is able to guard + what I have laid up in trust with him until that day. + 13 Keep holding the pattern of healthful + words that you heard from me with the faith and love that are in connection with Christ Jesus. + 14 This fine trust + guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us. + 15 You know this, that all the men in * the [district of] Asia + have turned away from me. + Phy·gelʹus and Her·mogʹe·nes are of that number. 16 May the Lord * grant mercy to the household of On·e·siphʹo·rus, + because he often brought me refreshment, + and he did not become ashamed of my chains. + 17 On the contrary, when he happened to be in Rome, he diligently looked for me and found me. + 18 May the Lord * grant him to find mercy + from Jehovah * in that day. + And all the services he rendered in Ephʹe·sus you know well enough. * Footnotes ^ “I am rendering sacred service.” Gr., la·treuʹo; J 17 (Heb.), ʼaniʹ ʽo·vedhʹ , “I am serving ( worshiping ).” See Ex 3:12 ftn. ^ “Witness.” Gr., mar·tyʹri·on; Lat., te·sti·moʹni·um . ^ Or, “me his prisoner.” ^ Or, “times eternal.” ^ Lit., “having made ineffective.” ^ Lit., “I have been persuaded.” ^ Or, “of.” ^ “The Lord,” א AVg; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16 , “Jehovah.” ^ “The Lord,” א AVg; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16 , “Jehovah.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “know better than I do.” Previous Next Print Share Share
