Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful + to me for ministering. 12 But I have sent Tychʹi·cus + off to Ephʹe·sus. 13 When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troʹas + with Carpus, and the scrolls, * especially the parchments. 14 Alexander + the coppersmith did me many injuries—Jehovah * will repay him according to his deeds + — 15 and you too be on guard against him, for he resisted our words to an excessive degree. 16 In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all proceeded to forsake me + —may it not be put to their account + — 17 but the Lord stood near me + and infused power into me, + that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; + and I was delivered from the lion’s mouth. + 18 The Lord will deliver me from every wicked work + and will save [me] for his heavenly kingdom. + To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 19 Give my greetings to Prisʹca * + and Aqʹui·la and the household of On·e·siphʹo·rus. + 20 E·rasʹtus + stayed in Corinth, + but I left Trophʹi·mus + sick at Mi·leʹtus. + 21 Do your utmost to arrive before winter. Eu·buʹlus sends you his greetings, and [so do] Puʹdens and Liʹnus and Clauʹdi·a and all * the brothers. 22 The Lord [be] with the spirit you [show]. + His undeserved kindness [be] with YOU people.
