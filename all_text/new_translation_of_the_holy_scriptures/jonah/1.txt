So he paid its fare and went down into it, in order to go with them to Tarʹshish from before Jehovah. 4 And Jehovah himself hurled forth a great wind * at the sea, + and there came to be a great tempest + on the sea; and as for the ship, it was about to be wrecked. 5 And the mariners began to fear and to call for aid, each one to his god. * + And they kept hurling out the articles that were in the ship to the sea, in order to lighten [it] of them. + But Joʹnah himself had gone down to the innermost parts of the decked vessel, and he proceeded to lie down and go fast asleep. + 6 At length the ship captain * came near to him and said to him: “What is the matter with you, sleeper? Get up, call out to your god! * + Perhaps the [true] God * will show himself caring about us, and we shall not perish.” + 7 And they began to say to one another: “Come, and let us cast lots, + that we may know on whose account we have this calamity.” + And they kept casting lots, and finally the lot fell upon Joʹnah. + 8 So they said to him: “Do tell us, please, on whose account it is that we are having this calamity? + What is your work, and from where do you come? What is your country, and from which people are you?” 9 At that he said to them: “I am a Hebrew, + and Jehovah the God of the heavens + I am fearing, + the One who made the sea and the dry land.” + 10 And the men * began to fear greatly, and they went on to say to him: “What is this that you have done?” + For the men had come to know that it was from before Jehovah that he was running away, because he had told them. 11 Finally they said to him: “What should we do to you, + in order that the sea may become still for us?” For the sea was continually growing more tempestuous. 12 So he said to them: “Lift me up and hurl me into the sea, and the sea will become still for YOU ; because I am aware that it is on my account that this great tempest is upon YOU .” + 13 But the men tried to work their way through, in order to bring [the ship] back to the dry land; yet they were unable, because the sea was continually growing more tempestuous against them. + 14 And they proceeded to call out to Jehovah and to say: + “Ah, now, O Jehovah, may we, please, not perish because of the soul * of this man! And do not put upon us innocent blood, + since you yourself, O Jehovah, have done according to what you have delighted in!” + 15 Then they lifted up Joʹnah and hurled him into the sea; and the sea began to halt from its raging. + 16 At that the men began to fear Jehovah greatly, + and so they offered a sacrifice to Jehovah + and made vows. + 17 * Now Jehovah appointed a great fish * to swallow Joʹnah, + so that Joʹnah came to be in the inward parts of the fish three days and three nights. + Footnotes ^ “Joppa.” Heb., Ya·phohʹ; Gr., I·opʹpen; Lat., Iopʹpen . ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma; Lat., venʹtum .
