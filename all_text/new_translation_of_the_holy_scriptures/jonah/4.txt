That is why I went ahead and ran away to Tarʹshish; + for I knew that you are a God * gracious and merciful, + slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, * + and feeling regret over the calamity. + 3 And now, O Jehovah, take away, please, my soul * + from me, for my dying is better than my being alive.” * + 4 In turn Jehovah said: “Have you rightly become hot with anger?” + 5 Then Joʹnah went out of the city and sat down east of the city; and gradually he made for himself there a booth, that he might sit under it in the shade + until he would see what would become of the city. + 6 Accordingly Jehovah God * appointed a bottle-gourd plant, * that it should come up over Joʹnah, in order to become a shade over his head, to deliver him from his calamitous state. + And Joʹnah began to rejoice greatly over the bottle-gourd plant. 7 But the [true] God appointed a worm + at the ascending of the dawn on the next day, that it should strike the bottle-gourd plant; and it gradually dried up. + 8 And it came about that, as soon as the sun shone forth, God * also went on to appoint a parching east wind, + and the sun kept striking upon the head of Joʹnah, so that he was swooning away; + and he kept asking that his soul * might die, and he repeatedly said: “My dying off is better than my being alive.” * + 9 And God proceeded to say to Joʹnah: “Have you rightly become hot with anger over the bottle-gourd plant?” + At that he said: “I have rightly become hot with anger, to the point of death.” 10 But Jehovah said: “You, for your part, felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, which you did not toil upon or make get big, which proved to be a mere growth of a night * and perished as a mere growth of a night. 11 And, for my part, ought I not to feel sorry for Ninʹe·veh the great city, + in which there exist more than one hundred and twenty thousand * men * who do not at all know the difference between their right hand and their left, besides many domestic animals?” + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §2. ^ “An affair of mine.” Or, “my word.” ^ “A God.” Heb., ʼEl; Lat., Deʹus . ^ Or, “loyal love.” Heb., cheʹsedh . ^ Or, “my life.” ^ See 2:7 ftn. ^ Or, “castor-oil plant.” Heb., qi·qa·yohnʹ . ^ “Jehovah God,” MTLXXSyVg.
