All your breakers and your waves—over me they passed on. + 4 And as for me, I said, ‘I have been driven away from in front of your eyes! + How shall I * gaze again upon your holy temple?’ + 5 Waters encircled me clear to [the] soul; + the watery deep itself * kept enclosing me. Weeds were wound around my head. 6 To the bottoms of [the] mountains I went down. As for the earth, its bars were upon me for time indefinite. But out of [the] pit you proceeded to bring up my life, O Jehovah my God. + 7 When my soul * fainted away within me, + Jehovah was the One whom I remembered. + Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. + 8 As for those who are observing the idols of untruth, they leave their own loving-kindness. + 9 But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you. + What I have vowed, I will pay. + Salvation belongs to Jehovah.” + 10 In time Jehovah commanded * the fish, so that it vomited out Joʹnah onto the dry land. + Footnotes ^ “His God .” Heb., ʼElo·h avʹ . ^ “Sheol.” Heb., sheʼohlʹ; Gr., haiʹdou; Lat., in·ferʹni .
