None should take food. Even water they should not drink. + 8 And let them cover themselves with sackcloth, man and domestic animal; and let them call out to God with strength and come back, + each one from his bad way and from the violence that was in their hands. 9 Who is there knowing whether the [true] God may turn back and actually feel regret + and turn back from his burning anger, so that we may not perish?” + 10 And the [true] God got to see their works, + that they had turned back from their bad way; + and so the [true] God felt regret + over the calamity that he had spoken of causing to them; and he did not cause [it]. + Footnotes ^ See App 1C §3. ^ Or, “extremely great; divinely great.” Heb., gedhoh·lahʹ lEʼ·lo·himʹ; Gr., me·gaʹle toi The·oiʹ .
