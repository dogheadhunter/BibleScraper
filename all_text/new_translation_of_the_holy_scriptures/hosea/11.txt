But Judah is yet roaming with God, * + and with the Most Holy One * he is trustworthy.” * Footnotes ^ Or, “lad; young man.” ^ “They,” MSyVg; LXX, “I.” ^ “From before them (from their faces),” MTVg; LXXSy, “from my face.” ^ Or, “To the Baals.” Heb., lab·Beʽa·limʹ; Gr., Ba·a·limʹ; Lat., Baʹa·lim . ^ “My,” in agreement with LXXSyVg; M, “his,” or, “one’s.” ^ Or, “man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “does any exalting.” Compare Ex 15:2; Ps 145:1 , where the same Heb. verb occurs.
