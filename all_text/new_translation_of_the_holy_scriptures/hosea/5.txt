S HOUT a war cry at Beth-aʹven + —after you, O Benjamin! + 9 O Eʹphra·im, a mere object of astonishment you will become in the day of rebuke. + Among the tribes of Israel I have made known trustworthy words. + 10 The princes of Judah have become just like those moving back a boundary. + Upon them I shall pour out my fury just like water. 11 Eʹphra·im is oppressed, crushed in justice, + for he had taken it upon himself to walk after his adversary. * + 12 And I was like the moth * + to Eʹphra·im and just like rottenness to the house of Judah. 13 “And Eʹphra·im got to see his sickness, and Judah his ulcer. + And Eʹphra·im proceeded to go to As·syrʹi·a + and send to a great king. * + But that one himself was unable to give healing to YOU people, + and he could not take from YOU an ulcer with any cure. + 14 For I shall be like a young lion to Eʹphra·im + and like a maned young lion to the house of Judah. I, I myself shall tear to pieces and I shall go [and] carry off, and there will be no deliverer. + 15 I shall go, I will return to my place until they bear their guilt; + and they will certainly seek my face. + When they are in sore straits, + they will seek me.” + Footnotes ^ “Their God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eh·hemʹ . ^ That is, a straight trumpet.
