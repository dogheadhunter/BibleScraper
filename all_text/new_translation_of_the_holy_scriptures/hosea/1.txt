And He * went on to say to him: “Call her name Lo-ru·haʹmah, * + for I shall no more show mercy + again to the house of Israel, because I shall positively take them away. * + 7 But to the house of Judah I shall show mercy, + and I will save them by Jehovah their God; * + but I shall not save them by a bow or by a sword or by war, by horses or by horsemen.” + 8 And she gradually weaned Lo-ru·haʹmah, and she proceeded to become pregnant and give birth to a son. 9 So He said: “Call his name Lo-amʹmi, * because YOU men are not my people * and I myself shall prove to be not YOURS . * 10 “And the number of the sons of Israel must become like the grains of the sand of the sea that cannot be measured or numbered. + And it must occur that in the place in which it used to be said to them, ‘Y OU men are not my people,’ + it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’ * + 11 And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will certainly be collected together into a unity * + and will actually set up for themselves one head and go up out of the land, + because great will be the day of Jezʹre·el. * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “fornications; prostitutions.” Heb., zenu·nimʹ, pl.
