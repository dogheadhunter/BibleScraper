And as regards the king, what will he do for us?’ 4 “They speak words, making false oaths, + concluding a covenant; + and judgment has sprouted like a poisonous plant in the furrows of the open field. + 5 For the calf [idol] of Beth-aʹven + the residents of Sa·marʹi·a will get frightened; for over it its people will certainly mourn, as well as its foreign-god priests * [who] used to be joyful over it, on account of its glory, because it will have gone into exile away from it. + 6 Even it someone will bring to As·syrʹi·a itself as a gift to a great king. * + Shame is what Eʹphra·im himself will get, + and Israel will be ashamed of its counsel. + 7 Sa·marʹi·a [and] her king will certainly be silenced, + like a snapped-off twig on the surface of waters. 8 And the high places of [Beth-]aʹven, + the sin of Israel, + will actually be annihilated. Thorns and thistles + themselves will come up upon their altars. + And people will in fact say to the mountains, ‘Cover us!’ and to the hills, ‘Fall over us!’ + 9 “From the days of Gibʹe·ah + you have sinned, + O Israel. There they stood still. In Gibʹe·ah war against the sons of unrighteousness did not get to overtake them. + 10 When it is my craving I shall also discipline them. + And against them peoples will certainly be gathered when there is a harnessing of them to their two errors. + 11 “And Eʹphra·im was a trained heifer loving to thresh; + and I, for my part, passed over her good-looking neck. I make [someone] ride Eʹphra·im. + Judah plows; + Jacob harrows + for him. 12 Sow seed for yourselves in righteousness; + reap in accord with loving-kindness. + Till for yourselves arable land, + when there is time for searching for Jehovah until he comes + and gives instruction in righteousness to YOU . + 13 “Y OU people have plowed wickedness. + Unrighteousness is what YOU have reaped. + Y OU have eaten the fruitage of deception, + for you have trusted in your way, + in the multitude of your mighty ones. + 14 And an uproar has risen among your people, + and your own fortified cities will all be despoiled, + as with the despoiling by Shalʹman of the house of Arʹbel, in the day of battle [when] a mother herself was dashed to pieces alongside [her] own sons. + 15 In this way one * will certainly do to YOU people, O Bethʹel, * because of YOUR extreme badness. + In the dawn the king of Israel will positively have to be silenced.” + Footnotes ^ “Luxuriant; outspreading,” if derived from another Heb. verb of the same form. ^ Or, “smooth; slippery.” ^ “As well as its foreign - god priests .” Heb., u· khema·r avʹ, “Chemarim”; Vg, “temple keepers.” ^ Or, “King Jareb.” See 5:13 ftn. ^ Or, “he,” MVg; LXX, “I”; Sy, “they.” ^ “Bethel,” MSyVg; LXX, “house of Israel.” Previous Next Print Share Share
