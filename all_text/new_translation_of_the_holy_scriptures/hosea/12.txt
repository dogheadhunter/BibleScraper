In Gilʹgal they have sacrificed even bulls. + Moreover, their altars are * like piles of stones in the furrows of the open field. + 12 And Jacob proceeded to run away to the field of Syria, * + and Israel + kept serving for a wife, * + and for a wife he guarded [sheep]. + 13 And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, + and by a prophet he was guarded. + 14 Eʹphra·im caused offense to bitterness, + and his deeds of bloodshed he leaves upon his own self, + and his reproach his grand Master * will repay to him.” + Footnotes ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach .
