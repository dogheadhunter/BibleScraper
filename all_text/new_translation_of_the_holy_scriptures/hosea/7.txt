Their own kings have all fallen; + none among them is calling out to me. + 8 “As for Eʹphra·im, it is among the peoples that he personally mingles himself. + Eʹphra·im himself has become a round cake not turned on the other side. + 9 Strangers have eaten up his power, + and he himself has not come to know [it]. + Also, gray hairs themselves have become white on him, but he himself has not come to know [it]. 10 And the pride of Israel has testified to his face, + and they have not returned to Jehovah their God, * + nor have they looked for him because of all this. + 11 And Eʹphra·im proves to be like a simpleminded dove + without heart. * + To Egypt they have called; + to As·syrʹi·a they have gone. + 12 “Whichever way they go, I shall spread out over them my net. + Like flying creatures of the heavens I shall bring them down. + I shall discipline them in agreement with the report to their assembly. + 13 Woe to them, + for they have fled from me! + Despoiling to them, for they have transgressed against me! And I myself proceeded to redeem them, + but they themselves have spoken lies even against me. + 14 And they did not call to me for aid with their heart, + although they kept howling on their beds. On account of their grain and sweet wine they kept loafing about; + they kept turning against me. + 15 And I, for my part, did disciplining; + I strengthened their arms, + but against me they kept scheming what was bad. + 16 And they proceeded to return, not to anything higher; * + they had become like a loose bow. + By the sword their princes will fall because of the denunciation of their tongue. + This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “it,” masc., referring to “furnace,” masc. ^ “Their God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eh·hemʹ . ^ Or, “without good motive .” Heb., ʼehn lev . ^ “Not to anything higher.” Lit., “not upward,” that is, not to an elevated form of worship.
