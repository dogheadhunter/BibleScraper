For their bread is for their own soul; * it will not come into the house of Jehovah. + 5 What will YOU people do in the day of meeting and in the day of the festival of Jehovah? + 6 For, look! they will have to go because of despoiling. + Egypt itself will collect them together; + Memʹphis, * + for its part, will bury them. As for their desirable things of silver, nettles themselves will take possession of them; + thorny bushes will be in their tents. + 7 “The days of being given attention must come; + the days of the due payment must come. + Those of Israel will know [it]. + The prophet will be foolish, + the man of inspired expression * will be maddened on account of the abundance of your error, + even animosity being abundant.” 8 The watchman + of Eʹphra·im was with my God. * + As regards a prophet, + there is the trap of a birdcatcher on all his ways; + there is an animosity in the house of his God. 9 They have gone down deep in bringing ruin, * + as in the days of Gibʹe·ah. + He will remember their error; + he will give attention to their sins. 10 “Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel. + Like the early fig on a fig tree in its beginning I saw the forefathers of YOU people. + They themselves went in to Baʹal of Peʹor, * + and they proceeded to dedicate themselves to * the shameful thing, + and they came to be disgusting like [the thing of] their love. + 11 As regards Eʹphra·im, like a flying creature their glory flies away, + so that there is no giving birth, and no [pregnant] belly and no conception. + 12 For although they bring up their sons, I will also bereave them of children so that there will be no man; + because—woe also to them when I turn away from them! + 13 Eʹphra·im, whom I have seen like Tyre planted in a pasture ground, + even Eʹphra·im is destined to a bringing out of his sons even to a killer.” + 14 Give to them, O Jehovah, what you should give. + Give them a miscarrying womb + and breasts shriveling up. 15 “All their badness was in Gilʹgal, + for there I had to hate them. + On account of the evil of their dealings I shall drive them away from my own house. + I will not continue on loving them. + All their princes are acting stubborn. + 16 Eʹphra·im must be struck down. + Their very root must dry up. + There will be no fruit that they produce. + Also, in case they bring to birth, I will even put to death the desirable things of their belly.” + 17 My God * + will reject them, for they have not listened to him, + and they will become fugitives among the nations. + Footnotes ^ Or, “for their own selves .” Heb., le naph·sh amʹ; Gr., tais psy·khaisʹ au·tonʹ; Lat., aʹni·mae i·psoʹrum .
