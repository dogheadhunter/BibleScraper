And she will have to say, ‘I want to go and return to my husband, + the first one, + for I had it better at that time than now.’ + 8 But she herself did not recognize + that it was I who had given to her the grain + and the sweet wine and the oil, and that I had made silver itself abound for her, and gold, [which] they made use of for Baʹal. * + 9 “‘Therefore I shall turn back and certainly take away my grain in its time and my sweet wine in its season, + and I will snatch away my wool and my linen for covering her nakedness. + 10 And now I shall uncover her private parts to the eyes of her passionate lovers, + and there will be no man * to snatch her out of my hand. + 11 And I shall certainly cause all her exultation, + her festival, + her new moon + and her sabbath and her every festal season to cease. 12 And I will lay desolate her vine + and her fig tree, + of which she has said: “They are a gift to me, which my passionate lovers have given to me”; and I will set them as a forest, + and the wild beast of the field will certainly devour them. 13 And I will hold an accounting + against her for the days of the Baʹal images * + to which she kept making sacrificial smoke, + when she kept decking herself with her ring and her ornament + and kept going after her passionate lovers, + and I was the one that she forgot,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah. 14 “‘Therefore here I am prevailing upon her, and I will cause her to go into the wilderness, + and I will speak to her heart. + 15 And I will give her her vineyards from then onward, + and the low plain * of Aʹchor * + as an entrance to hope; and she will certainly answer there as in the days of her youth + and as in the day of her coming up out of the land of Egypt. + 16 And it must occur in that day,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘that you will call [me] My husband, * and you will no longer call me My owner.’ * + 17 “‘And I will remove the names of the Baʹal images from her mouth, + and they will no longer be remembered * by their name. + 18 And for them I shall certainly conclude a covenant in that day in connection with the wild beast of the field + and with the flying creature of the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground, and the bow and the sword and war I shall break out of the land, + and I will make them lie down in security. + 19 And I will engage you to me for time indefinite, + and I will engage you to me in righteousness and in justice and in loving-kindness * and in mercies. + 20 And I will engage you to me in faithfulness; and you will certainly know Jehovah.’ * + 21 “‘And it must occur in that day that I shall answer,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘I shall answer the heavens, and they, for their part, will answer the earth; + 22 and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain + and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jezʹre·el [‘God will sow seed’]. + 23 And I shall certainly sow her like seed for me in the earth, + and I will show mercy to her who was not shown mercy, * + and I will say to those not my people: * “You are my people”; + and they, for their part, * will say: “[You are] my God.”’” * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “She has been shown mercy.” Heb., ru·chaʹmah . ^ “My people !” Heb., ʽam· miʹ . ^ Or, “her man .” Heb., ʼi·sh ahʹ . ^ Or, “my woman .” Heb., ʼish·t iʹ . ^ Or, “they made into a Baal [image].” ^ “And . . . man .” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “the Baals.” Heb., hab·Beʽa·limʹ; Gr., Ba·a·limʹ; Lat., Baʹa·lim . ^ Meaning “Ostracism; Trouble.” ^ Or, “valley.” ^ Or, “My man .” Heb., ʼi·sh iʹ . ^ Or, “My baal .” Heb., baʽ·l iʹ . ^ Or, “mentioned.” ^ Or, “and in loyal love .” Heb., u·ve cheʹsedh . ^ “Know Jehovah,” MLXXSy; Vg and about 45 Heb. mss, “know that I am Jehovah.” ^ “Her who was not shown mercy.” Heb., loʼ ru·chaʹmah .
