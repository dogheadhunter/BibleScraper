They have set up princes, but I did not know [it]. With their silver and their gold they have made for themselves idols, + to the end that they * may be cut off. + 5 Your calf has been cast off, + O Sa·marʹi·a. My anger has grown hot against them. + How long will they be incapable of innocency? + 6 For from Israel was even this. + A mere craftsman made it, + and it is not God; * because the calf of Sa·marʹi·a will become mere splinters. + 7 “For it is wind * that they keep sowing, and a storm wind is what they will reap. + Nothing has standing grain. + No sprout produces flour. + Should any perhaps produce [it], strangers themselves will swallow it down. + 8 “Israel must be swallowed down. + Now they must come to be among the nations, + like a vessel in which there is no delight. + 9 For they themselves have gone up to As·syrʹi·a, + as a zebra isolated to itself. + In Eʹphra·im’s case, they have hired lovers. + 10 Also, although they keep hiring [them] among the nations, + I shall now collect them together; and they will be a little while in severe pains + because of the burden of king [and] princes. 11 “For Eʹphra·im has multiplied altars in order to sin. + He has come to have altars in order to sin. + 12 I proceeded to write for him many things of my law; + just like something strange they have been accounted. + 13 As my gift sacrifices they kept sacrificing flesh, + and they kept eating what Jehovah himself took no pleasure in. + Now he will remember their error and hold an accounting for their sins. + To Egypt they themselves proceeded to return. + 14 And Israel began forgetting his Maker + and building temples; + and Judah, for his part, multiplied fortified cities. + And I shall certainly send fire into his cities and it must devour the dwelling towers of [each] one.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “shofar.” See 5:8 ftns. ^ Lit., “palate.” ^ “They,” LXXSyVg; M, “one (he).” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach; Lat., venʹtum .
