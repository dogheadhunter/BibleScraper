For, as to the [men], it is with the harlots that they get off to themselves, + and with the female temple prostitutes + that they sacrifice; and a people [that] does not understand + will be trodden down. 15 Although you are committing fornication, O Israel, + let not Judah become guilty, + and do not YOU people come to Gilʹgal, + neither go up to Beth-aʹven + nor swear ‘As Jehovah is alive!’ + 16 For, like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn. + Is it now that Jehovah will shepherd them like a young ram in a roomy place? 17 Eʹphra·im is joined with idols. + Let him be to himself! + 18 Their wheat beer * being gone, + they have positively treated [woman] as a harlot. + Her shielders + have positively loved dishonor. + 19 A wind * has wrapped her up in its wings. + And they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the earth .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ Or, “loyal love.” Heb., cheʹsedh . ^ Or, “will die”; or, “will be taken away.” See Isa 57:1 . ^ M is obscure here. ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ “My own glory they have exchanged” was the original reading.
