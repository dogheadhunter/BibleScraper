And I shall devour them there like a lion; + a wild beast of the field itself will tear them to pieces. + 9 It will certainly bring you to ruin, + O Israel, because it was against me, against your helper. + 10 “Where, then, is your king, that he may save you in all your cities, + and your judges, [concerning] whom you said, ‘Do give me a king and princes’? + 11 I proceeded to give you a king in my anger, + and I shall take [him] away in my fury. + 12 “The error of Eʹphra·im is wrapped up, his sin is treasured up. + 13 The labor pangs of a woman giving birth are what will come to him. + He is a son not wise, + for in season he will not stand still at the breaking forth of sons [from the womb]. + 14 “From the hand of Sheʹol * I shall redeem them; + from death * I shall recover them. * + Where are your stings, O Death? + Where is your destructiveness, O Sheʹol? * + Compassion itself will be concealed from my eyes. + 15 “In case he himself as the son of reed plants should show fruitfulness, + an east wind, the wind * of Jehovah, will come. + From a wilderness it is coming up, and it will dry up his well and drain his spring. + That one will pillage the treasure of all desirable articles. + 16 “Sa·marʹi·a will be held guilty, + for she is actually rebellious against her God. * + By the sword they will fall. + Their own children will be dashed to pieces, + and their pregnant women themselves will be ripped up.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “sacrificers of earthling man [Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ ].” ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ Or, “droughts.” ^ “From death .” Heb., mim· maʹweth ; Gr., ek tha·naʹtou ; Lat., de morʹte . ^ “O Sheol.” Heb., sheʼohlʹ; Gr., haiʹde; Lat., in·ferʹne . ^ Or, “I shall repurchase them.” Heb., ʼe gh·ʼa·l emʹ . ^ “Sheol.” Heb., sheʼohlʹ; Gr., haiʹdou; Lat., morʹtis, “death.” See App 4B . ^ “Wind.” Heb., ruʹach; Lat., venʹtum .
