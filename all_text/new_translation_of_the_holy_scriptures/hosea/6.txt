What shall I do to you, O Judah, + when the loving-kindness * of YOU people is like the morning clouds and like the dew that early goes away? 5 That is why I shall have to hew [them] by the prophets; + I shall have to kill them by the sayings of my mouth. + And the judgments upon you will be as the light that goes forth. + 6 For in loving-kindness I have taken delight, + and not in sacrifice; + and in the knowledge of God * rather than in whole burnt offerings. + 7 But they themselves, like earthling man, * have overstepped [the] covenant. + There is where they have dealt treacherously with me. + 8 Gilʹe·ad + is a town of practicers of what is harmful; their footprints are blood. + 9 And as in the lying in wait for a man, * + the association of priests are marauding bands. + By the wayside they commit murder at Sheʹchem, + because they have carried on nothing but loose conduct. + 10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing. + There there is fornication on the part of Eʹphra·im. + Israel has defiled itself. + 11 Furthermore, O Judah, a harvest has been fixed for you, when I gather back the captive ones of my people.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “the loyal love.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “like Adam .” Heb., ke ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “A man.” Heb., ʼish .
