They have a heart trained in covetousness. + They are accursed children. + 15 Abandoning the straight path, they have been misled. They have followed the path of Baʹlaam, + [the son] of Beʹor, who loved the reward of wrongdoing, + 16 but got a reproof for his own violation of what was right. * + A voiceless beast of burden, making utterance with the voice of a man, + hindered the prophet’s mad course. + 17 These are fountains without water, + and mists driven by a violent storm, and for them the blackness of darkness has been reserved. + 18 For they utter swelling expressions of no profit, and by the desires of the flesh + and by loose habits they entice + those who are just escaping + from people who conduct themselves in error. 19 While they are promising them freedom, + they themselves are existing as slaves of corruption. + For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one. * + 20 Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world + by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved * again with these very things and are overcome, + the final conditions have become worse for them than the first. + 21 For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness + than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them. + 22 The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: “The dog + has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “heresies.” Gr., hai·reʹseis; Lat., secʹtas . ^ “Acts of loose conduct.” Gr., a·sel·geiʹais .
