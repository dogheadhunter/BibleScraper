In them, however, are some things hard to understand, which the untaught * and unsteady are twisting, * as [they do] also the rest of the Scriptures, + to their own destruction. 17 Y OU , therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, + be on YOUR guard that YOU may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people * and fall from YOUR own steadfastness. + 18 No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. + To him [be] the glory both now and to the day of eternity. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “mental perception.” ^ Lit., “players in sport [of mocking].” ^ See App 5B . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “change of mind.” Gr., me·taʹnoi·an . ^ “Be discovered,” א B; AVg c , “be burned up.” ^ Lit., “will be loosed.” ^ Or, “the celestial bodies.” Gr., stoi·kheiʹa . ^ See App 1D . ^ “Keeping close in mind.” Or, “ardently desiring.” Lit., “speeding up.” ^ See App 5B . ^ “Of Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​17 ; CVg c (Gr.), tou Ky·riʹou; א ABVgSy h , “of God.” See App 1D . ^ Lit., “longness of spirit.” ^ Lit., “nonlearners.” ^ Lit., “are distorting.” ^ Lit., “illegal (ones).” Previous Next Print Share Share
