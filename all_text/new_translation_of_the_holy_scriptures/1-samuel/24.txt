David is in the wilderness of En-geʹdi.” + 2 And Saul proceeded to take three thousand chosen men + out of all Israel and to go looking for David + and his men upon the bare rocks of the mountain goats. + 3 At length he came to the stone sheepfolds along the road, where a cave was. So Saul came in to ease nature, * + while David and his men were in the parts of the cave + farthest back, sitting down. 4 And David’s men began to say to him: “Here is the day on which Jehovah does say to you, ‘Look! I am giving your enemy into your hand, + and you must do to him just as it may seem good in your eyes.’” + So David rose up and quietly cut off the skirt of the sleeveless coat that belonged to Saul. 5 But it came about afterward that David’s heart kept striking + him for the reason that he had cut off the skirt [of the sleeveless coat] * that belonged to Saul. 6 Hence he said to his men: “It is unthinkable, on my part, from Jehovah’s standpoint, that I should do this thing to my lord, the anointed * + of Jehovah, by thrusting out my hand against him, for he is the anointed of Jehovah.” + 7 Accordingly David dispersed his men with these words, and he did not allow them to rise up against Saul. + As for Saul, he rose up from the cave and kept going on his way. 8 So David rose up afterward and went out from the cave and called out after Saul, saying: “My lord + the king!” At this Saul looked behind him, and David proceeded to bow low with his face to the earth + and prostrate himself. 9 And David went on to say to Saul: “Why do you listen to the words of man, + saying, ‘Look! David is seeking your hurt’? 10 Here this day your eyes have seen how Jehovah gave you today into my hand in the cave; and someone said to kill + you, but I felt sorry for you and said, ‘I shall not thrust out my hand against my lord, for he is the anointed + of Jehovah.’ 11 And, my father, + see, yes, see the skirt of your sleeveless coat in my hand, for when I cut off the skirt of your sleeveless coat I did not kill you. Know and see that there is no badness + or revolt in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, while you are lying in wait for my soul to take it away. + 12 May Jehovah judge between me and you; + and Jehovah must take vengeance + for me from you, but my own hand will not come to be upon you. + 13 Just as the proverb of the ancients says, ‘From the wicked ones wickedness will go forth,’ + but my own hand will not come to be upon you. 14 After whom has the king of Israel gone out? After whom are you chasing? After a dead dog? + After a single flea? + 15 And Jehovah must become judge, and he must judge between me and you, and he will see and he will conduct the legal case + for me and judge me [to free me] from your hand.” 16 And it came about that, at the moment that David finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul proceeded to say: “Is this your voice, my son David?” + And Saul began to raise his own voice and weep. + 17 And he went on to say to David: “You are more righteous than I am, + for it is you who have rendered me good, + and it is I who have rendered you evil. 18 And you—you have told today what good you have done in connection with me in that Jehovah surrendered me into your hand + and you did not kill me. 19 Now in the case where a man finds his enemy, will he send him away on a good road? + So Jehovah himself will reward you with good, + due to the fact that this day you have done it to me. 20 And now, look! I well know that you will, without fail, rule as king, + and that in your hand the kingdom of Israel will certainly endure. 21 So now do swear to me by Jehovah + that you will not cut off my seed after me and that you will not annihilate my name out of the house of my father.” + 22 Accordingly David swore to Saul, after which Saul went to his home. + As for David and his men, they went up to the place difficult to approach. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “came in to cover his feet.” ^ “Skirt of the sleeveless coat,” TLXXSyVg and eight Heb. mss; M, “skirt.” ^ “To my lord , the anointed of.” Heb., l aʼ·dho·n iʹ li m·shiʹach ; Gr., toi ky·riʹoi mou toi khri·stoiʹ ; Syr., le mar i la m·shi·ch eh; Lat., doʹmi·no meʹo chriʹsto .
