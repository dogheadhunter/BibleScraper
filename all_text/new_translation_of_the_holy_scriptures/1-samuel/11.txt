When there proved to be some that were left over, then they were sent scattering and there were not left over among them two together. + 12 And the people began to say to Samuel: “Who is it saying, ‘Saul—is he to be king * over us?’ + G IVE the men over, that we may put them to death.” + 13 However, Saul * said: “Not a man should be put to death on this day, + because today Jehovah has performed salvation in Israel.” + 14 Later Samuel said to the people: “Come and let us go to Gilʹgal + that we may there make the kingship anew.” + 15 So all the people went to Gilʹgal, and there they proceeded to make Saul king * before Jehovah in Gilʹgal. Then they rendered up communion sacrifices there before Jehovah, + and there Saul and all the men of Israel continued rejoicing to a great degree. + Footnotes ^ Or, “Jabesh-gilead.” ^ “Spirit of God.” Heb., ru·ach-­ʼElo·himʹ; TLXXVg and two Heb. mss, “spirit of Jehovah.” ^ “They,” MVg; LXXSy, “He.” ^ See Ex 14:24 ftn. ^ “Ammon,” MVg; TLXXSy and three Heb. mss, “the sons of Ammon.” ^ “Saul​—⁠is he to be king?” MVg c ; LXXSy, “Saul​—⁠he should not be king.” ^ “Saul,” MSyVg; LXX B and other Gr. mss, “Samuel.” ^ “And there Samuel anointed Saul to be king,” LXX.
