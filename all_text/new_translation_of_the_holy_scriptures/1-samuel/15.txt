As for you, you exercised loving-kindness * with all the sons of Israel + at the time of their coming up out of Egypt.” + So the Kenʹites departed from the midst of Amʹa·lek. 7 After that Saul went striking down Amʹa·lek + from Havʹi·lah + as far as Shur, + which is in front of Egypt. 8 And he got to catch Aʹgag + the king of Amʹa·lek alive, and all the other people he devoted to destruction with the edge of the sword. + 9 But Saul and the people had compassion upon Aʹgag and upon the best of the flock and the herd + and the fat ones * and upon the rams and upon all that was good, and they did not wish to devote them to destruction. + As for all the goods that were despicable and rejected, these they devoted to destruction. 10 The word of Jehovah now came * to Samuel, saying: 11 “I do regret + that I have caused Saul to reign as king, because he has turned + back from following me, and my words he has not carried out.” + And it was distressing to Samuel, * + and he kept crying out to Jehovah all night long. + 12 Then Samuel got up early to meet Saul in the morning. But report was made to Samuel, saying: “Saul came to Carʹmel, + and, look! he was erecting a monument + for himself, and he then turned around and went across and descended to Gilʹgal.” 13 At length Samuel came to Saul, and Saul began to say to him: “Blessed + are you of Jehovah. I have carried out the word of Jehovah.” + 14 But Samuel said: “Then what does this sound of the flock in my ears mean, and the sound of the herd that I am hearing?” + 15 To this Saul said: “From the A·malʹek·ites they have brought them, because the people + had compassion upon the best of the flock and of the herd, for the purpose of sacrificing to Jehovah your God; + but what was left over we have devoted to destruction.” 16 At this Samuel said to Saul: “Stop! And I will tell you what Jehovah spoke to me last night.” + So he * said to him: “Speak!” 17 And Samuel went on to say: “Was it not when you were little in your own eyes + that you were head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah proceeded to anoint + you as king over Israel? 18 Later Jehovah sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go, and you must devote the sinners, + the A·malʹek·ites, * to destruction, and you must fight against them until you will have exterminated them.’ + 19 So why is it you did not obey the voice of Jehovah but went darting greedily at the spoil + and doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah?” + 20 However, Saul said to Samuel: “But I have obeyed + the voice of Jehovah in that I went on the mission on which Jehovah had sent me and I brought Aʹgag + the king of Amʹa·lek, but Amʹa·lek I have devoted to destruction. + 21 And the people + went taking from the spoil sheep and cattle, the choicest of them as something devoted to destruction, to sacrifice + to Jehovah your God in Gilʹgal.” + 22 In turn Samuel said: “Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings + and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey + is better than a sacrifice, + to pay attention than the fat + of rams; 23 for rebelliousness + is the same as the sin of divination, + and pushing ahead presumptuously * the same as [using] uncanny power and teraphim. * + Since you have rejected the word of Jehovah, + he * accordingly rejects you from being king.” * + 24 Then Saul said to Samuel: “I have sinned; + for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people + and so obeyed their voice. 25 And now, please, pardon + my sin and return with me that I may prostrate + myself to * Jehovah.” 26 But Samuel said to Saul: “I shall not return with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah rejects you from continuing as king over Israel.” + 27 As Samuel was turning about to go, he immediately grabbed hold of the skirt of his sleeveless coat, but it ripped + away. 28 At this Samuel said to him: “Jehovah has ripped away + the royal rule of Israel from off you today, and he will certainly give it to a fellowman of yours who is better than you. + 29 And, besides, the Excellency * of Israel + will not prove false, + and He will not feel regrets, for He is not an earthling man * so as to feel regrets.” + 30 At this he * said: “I have sinned. Now honor me, + please, in front of the older men of my people and in front of Israel and return with me, and I shall certainly prostrate myself to Jehovah your God.” + 31 So Samuel returned behind Saul, and Saul proceeded to prostrate himself to Jehovah. 32 After that Samuel said: “B RING Aʹgag the king of Amʹa·lek near to me.” Then Aʹgag went to him reluctantly, * and Aʹgag began to say to himself: * “Truly the bitter experience of death has departed.” 33 However, Samuel said: “Just as your sword + has bereaved women of children, in that way your mother + will be most bereaved of children among women.” + With that Samuel went hacking Aʹgag to pieces before Jehovah in Gilʹgal. + 34 Samuel now went his way to Raʹmah, and Saul, for his part, went up to his own house at Gibʹe·ah + of Saul. 35 And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, because Samuel had gone into mourning + for Saul. As for Jehovah, he regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel. + Footnotes ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Sweep you away,” by a slight emendation; M, “collect (gather) you.” ^ “Fat ones,” T; M, “animals of the second litter,” hence, more valued. ^ Or, “occurred; came to be.” ^ “It was distressing to Samuel,” by a slight emendation; M, “Samuel became angry.” ^ “He,” M margin ; M, “they.” ^ Lit., “Amalek.” ^ “From being king,” MVg; LXX, “from being king over Israel.” ^ “He,” MSy; LXX, “Jehovah.” ^ “Teraphim,” MLXX; Vg, “idolatry.” ^ “Pushing ahead presumptu­ously.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ Or, “I may worship.” ^ Or, “Eminence,” MSy; Vg, “Triumphant One.” ^ Or, “a man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ; Gr., anʹthro·pos; Lat., hoʹmo; Sy, “son of man.” ^ “He,” MVg; LXXSy, “Saul.” ^ Or, “in fetters.” Or, “cheerfully.” LXX, “trembling.” ^ Or, “began to think.” Previous Next Print Share Share
