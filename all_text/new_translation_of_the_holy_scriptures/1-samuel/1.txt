And Pe·ninʹnah came to have children, but Hanʹnah had no children. + 3 And that man went up out of his city from year to year * to prostrate himself + and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies * in Shiʹloh. + And there is where the two sons of Eʹli, * Hophʹni and Phinʹe·has, + were priests to Jehovah. + 4 And there came to be a day when El·kaʹnah proceeded to sacrifice, and he gave to Pe·ninʹnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions; + 5 but to Hanʹnah he gave one portion. Nonetheless * it was Hanʹnah that he loved, + and, as for Jehovah, he had closed up her womb. + 6 And her rival wife * also vexed + her sorely for the sake of making her feel disconcerted because Jehovah had closed up her womb. 7 And that was the way she * would do year by year, + as often as she * went up into the house of Jehovah. + That was the way she would vex her, so that she would weep and not eat. 8 And El·kaʹnah her husband proceeded to say to her: “Hanʹnah, why do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why does your heart feel bad? + Am I not better to you than ten sons?” + 9 Then Hanʹnah got up after they * had eaten in Shiʹloh * and after the drinking, * while Eʹli the priest was sitting upon the seat by the doorpost of the temple * + of Jehovah. 10 And she was bitter of soul, + and she began to pray to Jehovah + and to weep greatly. + 11 And she went on to make a vow + and say: “O Jehovah of armies, if you will without fail look upon the affliction of your slave girl + and actually remember me, + and you will not forget your slave girl and actually give to your slave girl a male offspring, I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head.” + 12 And it occurred that while she prayed extendedly + before Jehovah, Eʹli was watching her mouth. 13 As for Hanʹnah, she was speaking in her heart; + only her lips were quivering, and her voice was not heard. But Eʹli took her for drunk. + 14 So Eʹli said to her: “How long will you behave drunk? + Put away your wine from upon you.” 15 At this Hanʹnah answered and said: “No, my lord! A woman hard pressed in spirit I am; and wine and intoxicating liquor I have not drunk, but I pour out my soul before Jehovah. + 16 Do not make your slave girl like a good-for-nothing + woman, * for it is out of the abundance of my concern and my vexation that I have spoken until now.” + 17 Then Eʹli answered and said: “Go in peace, + and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.” + 18 To this she said: “Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes.” + And the woman proceeded to go on her way and to eat, + and her face became self-concerned no more. + 19 Then they got up early in the morning and prostrated themselves before Jehovah, after which they returned and came into their house at Raʹmah. + El·kaʹnah now had intercourse + with Hanʹnah his wife, and Jehovah began remembering her. + 20 So it came about at the rolling around of a year * that Hanʹnah became pregnant and brought a son to birth and proceeded to call his name + Samuel, * because, said she, “it is from Jehovah that I have asked + him.” 21 In time the man El·kaʹnah went up with all his household to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice * + and his vow offering. + 22 As for Hanʹnah, she did not go up, + for she had said to her husband: “As soon as the boy is weaned, + I must bring him, and he must appear before Jehovah and dwell there to time indefinite.” + 23 At this El·kaʹnah her husband + said to her: “Do what is good in your eyes. + Stay at home until you wean him. Only may Jehovah carry out his * word.” + So the woman stayed at home and kept nursing her son until she weaned him. + 24 Accordingly just as soon as she had weaned him, she brought him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull * and one eʹphah * of flour and a large jar of wine, + and she proceeded to enter * the house of Jehovah in Shiʹloh. + And the boy was with her. * 25 Then they * slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eʹli. + 26 With that she said: “Excuse me, my lord! By the life of your soul, + my lord, I am the woman that was standing with you in this place to pray to Jehovah. + 27 It was with reference to this boy that I prayed that Jehovah should grant me my petition + that I asked of him. + 28 And I, in my turn, have lent him * to Jehovah. + All the days that he does happen to be, * he is one requested for Jehovah.” * And he * proceeded to bow down there to Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ “Of Ramathaim-zophim.” Or, “of Ramah, a Zuphite.” LXX, “of Armathaim-zipha”; Vg, “of Ramathaim-sophim.” See vs 19; 1Ch 6:26, 35 . ^ “Elihu,” M; LXX, “Eliou”; MLXX in 1Ch 6:27 , “Eliab”; in 1Ch 6:34 , “Eliel.” ^ By settlement in the territory of Ephraim, but Elkanah was actually a Levite.
