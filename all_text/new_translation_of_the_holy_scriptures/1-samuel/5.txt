Footnotes ^ LXX adds: “and went into the house of Dagon and looked.” ^ “Took,” MSyVg; LXX, “raised up.” ^ Or, “podium.” ^ Lit., “Only Dagon,” as the Dagon idol was seemingly half man, half fish. ^ LXX adds: “because those stepping (leaping) over step (leap) over.” Compare Zep 1:9 . ^ Or, “with plague boils .” Heb., ba ʽ·pho·limʹ . Since this Heb. word is associated with the human anus, the Masoretes, as a show of modesty, pointed the word with the vowels for techo·rimʹ, “tumors.” They also showed this word in the margin, for it to be read instead. ^ Or, “began desolating [them].” ^ “Our god .” Heb., ʼelo·h ehʹnu, pl. to denote majesty, applied to Dagon; Gr., the·onʹ ; Lat., deʹum . Compare Jg 16:23 ftn. ^ “To Gath,” LXX. ^ “From small to great, and their rectums protruding began putrefying. And the people of Gath took counsel together and made themselves seats of skins,” Vg c . ^ “The [true] God.” Heb., ha·­ʼElo·himʹ, the definite article ha, “the,” preceding the title ʼElo·himʹ to distinguish him from the false god Dagon.
