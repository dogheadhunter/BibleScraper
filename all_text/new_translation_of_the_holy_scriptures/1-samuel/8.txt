You yourself have grown old, but your own sons have not walked in your ways. Now do appoint for us a king + to judge us like all the nations.” 6 But the thing was bad in the eyes of Samuel inasmuch as they had said: “Do give us a king to judge us,” and Samuel began to pray to Jehovah. + 7 Then Jehovah said to Samuel: + “Listen to the voice of the people as respects all that they say to you; + for it is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected from being king + over them. 8 In accord with all their doings that they have done from the day of my bringing them up out of Egypt + until this day in that they kept leaving me + and serving other gods, + that is the way they are doing also to you. 9 And now listen to their voice. Only this, that you should solemnly warn them, and you must tell them the rightful due of the king who will reign over them.” + 10 So Samuel said all the words of Jehovah to the people who were asking a king of him. 11 And he proceeded to say: “This will become the rightful due + of the king that will reign over YOU : Y OUR sons he will take + and put them as his in his chariots + and among his horsemen, + and some will have to run before his chariots; + 12 and to appoint for himself chiefs * over thousands + and chiefs over fifties, + and [some] to do his plowing + and to reap his harvest + and to make his war instruments + and his chariot instruments. + 13 And YOUR daughters he will take for ointment mixers and cooks and bakers. + 14 And YOUR fields and YOUR vineyards + and YOUR olive groves, + the best ones, he will take and actually give to his servants. 15 And of YOUR fields of seed and of YOUR vineyards he will take the tenth, + and he will certainly give [them] to his court officials + and his servants. 16 And YOUR menservants and YOUR maidservants and YOUR best herds, * and YOUR asses he will take, and he will have to use them for his work. + 17 Of YOUR flocks + he will take the tenth, and YOU yourselves will become his as servants. 18 And YOU will certainly cry out in that day by reason of YOUR king, + whom YOU have chosen for yourselves, but Jehovah will not answer YOU in that day.” + 19 However, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel + and said: “No, but a king is what will come to be over us. 20 And we must become, we also, like all the nations, + and our king must judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 21 And Samuel gave a hearing to all the words of the people; then he spoke them in the ears of Jehovah. + 22 And Jehovah proceeded to say to Samuel: “Listen to their voice, and you must cause a king to reign for them.” + Accordingly Samuel said to the men of Israel: “Go each one to his city.” Footnotes ^ Compare Ex 18:21 ftns. ^ “Herds,” LXX; MSyVg, “young men.” Previous Next Print Share Share
