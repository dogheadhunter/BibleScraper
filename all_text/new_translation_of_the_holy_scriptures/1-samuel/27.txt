There is nothing better for me than that I should escape + without fail to the land of the Phi·lisʹtines; + and Saul must despair of me in looking for me any longer in all the territory of Israel, + and I shall certainly escape from his hand.” 2 So David rose up and he and six hundred men + that were with him passed over to Aʹchish + the son of Maʹoch, the king of Gath. 3 And David continued to dwell with Aʹchish in Gath, he and his men, each one with his household, + David and his two wives, A·hinʹo·am + the Jezʹre·el·i·tess and Abʹi·gail, + Naʹbal’s wife, the Carʹmel·it·ess. 4 In time report was made to Saul that David had run away to Gath, and so he did not go looking for him still another time. + 5 Then David said to Aʹchish: “If, now, I have found favor in your eyes, let them give me a place in one of the cities of the countryside, that I may dwell there; for why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?” 6 Accordingly Aʹchish gave him Zikʹlag + on that day. That is why Zikʹlag has come to belong to the kings of Judah down to this day. 7 And the number of the days that David dwelt in the countryside of the Phi·lisʹtines came to be a year and four months. + 8 And David proceeded to go up with his men that they might raid the Geshʹur·ites + and the Girʹzites and the A·malʹek·ites; + for they were inhabiting the land that [extended] from Teʹlam * + as far as Shur + and down to the land of Egypt. 9 And David struck the land, but he preserved neither man nor woman alive; + and he took flocks and herds and asses and camels and garments, after which he returned and came to Aʹchish. 10 Then Aʹchish said: “Where did YOU men make a raid today?” To this David said: + “Upon the south of Judah + and upon the south of the Je·rahʹme·el·ites + and upon the south of the Kenʹites.” + 11 As for man and woman, David was not preserving any alive to bring them to Gath, saying: “That they may not tell on us, saying, ‘This is the way David did.’” + (And this way has been his procedure all the days that he dwelt in the countryside of the Phi·lisʹtines.) 12 Consequently Aʹchish believed + David, saying to himself: “He has unquestionably become a stench among his people Israel; + and he will have to become my servant to time indefinite.” Footnotes ^ “From Tela(m),” LXX 12 mss ; Heb., me· ʽoh·lamʹ , “from long ago .” Compare 15:4; Jos 15:24 .
