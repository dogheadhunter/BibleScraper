When the sons of Israel heard of it, they began to be afraid on account of the Phi·lisʹtines. + 8 So the sons of Israel said to Samuel: “Do not keep silent for our sakes from calling to Jehovah our God for aid, + that he may save us from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines.” 9 Then Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it up as a burnt offering, a whole offering, + to Jehovah; and Samuel began calling to Jehovah for aid in behalf of Israel, + and Jehovah proceeded to answer him. + 10 And it came about that while Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Phi·lisʹtines themselves drew near for battle against Israel. And Jehovah now caused it to thunder with a loud noise + on that day against the Phi·lisʹtines, that he might throw them into confusion; + and they got defeated before Israel. + 11 At that the men of Israel sallied forth from Mizʹpah and went in pursuit of the Phi·lisʹtines and kept striking them down as far as south of Beth-car. 12 Then Samuel took a stone + and set it between Mizʹpah and Jeshʹa·nah * and began to call its name Eb·en·eʹzer. * Accordingly he said: “Till now Jehovah has helped us.” + 13 Thus the Phi·lisʹtines were subdued, and they did not come anymore into the territory of Israel; + and the hand of Jehovah continued to be against the Phi·lisʹtines all the days of Samuel. + 14 And the cities that the Phi·lisʹtines had taken from Israel kept coming back to Israel from Ekʹron to Gath, and the territory of them Israel delivered from the hand of the Phi·lisʹtines. And there came to be peace between Israel and the Amʹor·ites. + 15 And Samuel kept on judging Israel all the days of his life. + 16 And he traveled from year to year and made the circuit of Bethʹel + and Gilʹgal + and Mizʹpah + and judged Israel + at all these places. 17 But his return was to Raʹmah, + because there was where his house was, and there he judged Israel. And he proceeded to build an altar there to Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ “On the hill,” MLXX; Vg, “in Gibeah.” ^ Or, “Israel kept holding with.” ^ Lit., “the gods of the foreign (country).” ^ LXX adds, “upon the earth.” ^ Meaning “the Stone of Help.” Heb., ʼEʹven ha·ʽAʹzer .
