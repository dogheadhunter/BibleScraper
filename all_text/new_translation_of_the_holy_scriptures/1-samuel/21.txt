And how much more so today, when one becomes holy in [his] organism?” 6 At that the priest gave him what was holy, + because there happened to be no bread there but the showbread * that had been removed from before Jehovah + so as to place fresh * bread there on the day of its being taken away. 7 Now one of Saul’s servants was there on that day, detained + before Jehovah, and his name was Doʹeg + the Eʹdom·ite, + the principal one of the shepherds * that belonged to Saul. + 8 And David went on to say to A·himʹe·lech: “And is there nothing here at your disposal, a spear or a sword? For neither my own sword nor my weapons did I take in my hand, because the king’s matter proved to be urgent.” 9 To this the priest said: “The sword of Go·liʹath + the Phi·lisʹtine, whom you struck down in the low plain of Eʹlah + —here it is, wrapped up in a mantle, behind the ephʹod. + If it is what you would take for yourself, take it, because there is no other here except it.” And David went on to say: “There is none like it. Give it to me.” 10 Then David rose up and continued running away + on account of Saul on that day, and at length came to Aʹchish the king of Gath. + 11 And the servants of Aʹchish began to say to him: “Is not this David the king + of the land? Was it not to this one that they kept responding with * dances, + saying, ‘Saul has struck down his thousands, And David his tens of thousands’?” * + 12 And David began to take these words to his heart, and he became very much afraid + on account of Aʹchish the king of Gath. 13 So he disguised + his sanity under their eyes + and began acting insane in their hand and kept making cross marks * on the doors of the gate * and let his saliva run down upon his beard. 14 Finally Aʹchish said to his servants: “Here YOU see a man behaving crazy. Why should YOU bring him to me? 15 Am I in need of people driven crazy, so that YOU have brought this one to behave crazy by me? Should this one come into my home?” Footnotes ^ “Young men,” that is, of his escort. ^ “If there are five loaves of bread under your hand, give into my hand,” LXX; MSy, “what is there under your hand?
