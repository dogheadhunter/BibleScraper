Jehovah * came with his holy myriads, * + 15 to execute judgment against all, + and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” + 16 These men are murmurers, + complainers about their lot in life, * proceeding according to their own desires, + and their mouths speak swelling things, + while they are admiring personalities * + for the sake of [their own] benefit. 17 As for YOU , beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, + 18 how they used to say to YOU : “In the last time there will be ridiculers, * proceeding according to their own desires for ungodly things.” + 19 These are the ones that make separations, * + animalistic [men], * + not having spirituality. * + 20 But YOU , beloved ones, by building up yourselves + on YOUR most holy faith, + and praying with holy spirit, + 21 keep yourselves in God’s love, + while YOU are waiting for the mercy + of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view. + 22 Also, continue showing mercy + to some that have doubts; + 23 save [them] + by snatching [them] out of the fire. + But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while YOU hate even the inner garment that has been stained by the flesh. + 24 Now to the one who is able to guard + YOU from stumbling * and to set YOU unblemished + in the sight of his glory * with great joy, 25 to [the] only God our Savior * + through Jesus Christ + our Lord, be glory, + majesty, might + and authority + for all past eternity * + and now and into all eternity. + Amen. + Footnotes ^ Or, “Judas.” Gr., I·ouʹdas, meaning “Lauded.” ^ Lit., “(ones) having been kept.” ^ Lit., “encouraging.” ^ Lit., “to be struggling upon.” ^ Lit., “irreverential (ones).” ^ Or, “for licentiousness (wantonness; shameless conduct).” Gr., eis a·selʹgei·an; J 17,​22 (Heb.), lezim·mahʹ . ^ “Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​11-14,​16-18,​22,​23 ; א (Gr.), Kyʹri·os; C c , “God”; ABVg, “Jesus.” See App 1D . ^ Lit., “they are blaspheming.” ^ Lit., “of glories.” ^ Lit., “having judged for self dividedly.” ^ Lit., “he was saying in disagreement.” ^ “Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​11-14,​16-18,​22-24 ; AB(Gr.), Kyʹri·os; א * , “God.” See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “holy tens of thousands.” ^ Lit., “complainers at fate.” ^ Lit., “wondering at faces.” ^ Lit., “players in sport [of mocking].” ^ Or, “distinctions.” ^ Lit., “soulical ones; physical ones.” Gr., psy·khi·koiʹ; Lat., a·ni·maʹles; J 17 (Heb.), naph·shi·yimʹ . ^ Lit., “spirit.” Gr., pneuʹma; Lat., spiʹri·tum; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), we ruʹach , “and spirit .” ^ Lit., “not tripping.” ^ Or, “unblemished before his glorious person.” ^ Lit., “to only God Savior of us.” Gr., moʹnoi The·oiʹ So·teʹri he·monʹ; Lat., soʹli Deʹo sal·va·toʹri noʹstro . ^ Or, “before all time.” Previous Next Print Share Share
