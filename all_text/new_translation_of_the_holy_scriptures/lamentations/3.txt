I have lost memory of what good is. + 18 And I keep saying: “My excellency has perished, and my expectation from Jehovah.” + ז [ Zaʹyin ] 19 Remember my affliction and my homeless state, + the wormwood and the poisonous plant. + 20 Without fail your * soul will remember and bow low over me. + 21 This is what I shall bring back to my heart. + That is why I shall show a waiting attitude. + ח [ Chehth ] 22 It is the acts of loving-kindness * + of Jehovah that we have not come to our finish, + because his mercies will certainly not come to an end. + 23 They are new each morning. + Your faithfulness is abundant. + 24 “Jehovah is my share,” + my soul has said, “that is why I shall show a waiting attitude for him.” + ט [ Tehth ] 25 Good is Jehovah to the one hoping in him, + to the soul that keeps seeking for him. + 26 Good it is that one should wait, + even silently, + for the salvation of Jehovah. + 27 Good it is for an able-bodied man that he should carry the yoke during his youth. + י [ Yohdh ] 28 Let him sit solitary and keep silent, + because he has laid [something] upon him. + 29 Let him put his mouth in the very dust. + Perhaps there exists a hope. + 30 Let him give [his] cheek to the very one striking him. + Let him have his sufficiency of reproach. + כ [ Kaph ] 31 For not to time indefinite will Jehovah * keep on casting off. + 32 For although he has caused grief, + he will also certainly show mercy according to the abundance of his loving-kindness. + 33 For not out of his own heart has he afflicted or does he grieve the sons of men. * + ל [ Laʹmedh ] 34 For crushing beneath one’s feet + all the prisoners of the earth, + 35 For turning aside the judgment of an able-bodied man before the face of the Most High, + 36 For making a man * crooked in his legal case, Jehovah * himself has had no countenance. + מ [ Mem ] 37 Who, now, has said that something should occur [when] Jehovah * himself has not commanded? + 38 From the mouth of the Most High bad things and what is good do not go forth. + 39 How can a living man * indulge in complaints, + an able-bodied man on account of his sin? + נ [ Nun ] 40 Do let us search out our ways and explore them, + and do let us return clear to Jehovah. + 41 Let us raise our heart along with [our] palms to God * in the heavens: + 42 “We ourselves have transgressed, and we have behaved rebelliously. + You yourself have not forgiven. + ס [ Saʹmekh ] 43 You have blocked approach with anger, + and you keep pursuing us. + You have killed; you have shown no compassion. + 44 You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud mass, + that prayer may not pass through. + 45 You make us mere offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.” + פ [ Peʼ ] * 46 Against us all our enemies have opened their mouth. + 47 Dread and the hollow themselves have become ours, + desolateness and breakdown. + 48 With streams of water my eye keeps running down on account of the breakdown of the daughter of my people. + ע [ ʽAʹyin ] 49 My very eye has been poured forth and will not keep still, so that there are no pauses, + 50 Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven. + 51 My own eye has dealt severely with my soul, + because of all the daughters * of my city. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 52 My enemies have positively hunted for me just as for a bird, + for no cause. + 53 They have silenced my life in the pit itself, + and they kept hurling stones at me. 54 Waters have flowed over my head. + I have said: “I shall certainly be cut off!” + ק [ Qohph ] 55 I have called out your name, O Jehovah, from a pit of the lowest sort. + 56 My voice you must hear. + Do not hide your ear to my relief, to my cry for help. + 57 You have drawn near in the day that I kept calling you. + You said: “Do not be afraid.” + ר [ Rehsh ] 58 You have taken up, O Jehovah, * the contests of my soul. + You have repurchased my life. + 59 You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me. + O do conduct the judgment for me. + 60 You have seen all their vengeance, all their thoughts against me. + ש [ Sin ] or [ Shin ] 61 You have heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their thoughts against me, + 62 The lips of those rising up against me + and their whispering against me all day long. + 63 Do look at their very sitting down and their rising up. + I am the subject of their song. + ת [ Taw ] 64 You will give back to them a treatment, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands. + 65 You will give to them the insolence of heart, + your curse to them. + 66 You will pursue in anger and annihilate them + from under the heavens of Jehovah. + Footnotes ^ Each line in each section of this chapter begins with the same Heb. letter in alphabetic order; the Peʼ section (vss 46-48) precedes the ʽAʹyin section (vss 49-51). ^ Or, “he tears me to pieces.” ^ “All my people,” MLXXVg; Sy, “all peoples”; T, “all scatterers of my people.” ^ “Your,” emended by the Sopherim to read “my” in M; one of the Eighteen Emendations.
