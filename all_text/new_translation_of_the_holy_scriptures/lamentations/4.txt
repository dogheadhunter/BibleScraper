They have suckled their cubs. The daughter of my people becomes cruel, + like ostriches in the wilderness. + ד [ Daʹleth ] 4 The tongue of the suckling has cleaved to its palate because of thirst. + Children themselves have asked for bread. + There is no one dealing [it] out to them. + ה [ He ʼ] 5 The very ones that were eating pleasant things have been struck with astonishment in the streets. + The very ones that were being reared in scarlet + have had to embrace ash heaps. + ו [ Waw ] 6 The [punishment for the] error of the daughter of my people also becomes greater than the [punishment for the] sin of Sodʹom, + Which was overthrown as in a moment, and to which no hands turned [helpfully]. + ז [ Zaʹyin ] 7 Her Nazʹi·rites + were purer than snow; + they were whiter than milk. They were in fact more ruddy + than corals; their polish was as the sapphire. + ח [ Chehth ] 8 Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. + Their skin has shriveled upon their bones. + It has become just as dry as a tree. ט [ Tehth ] 9 Better have those slain with the sword + proved to be than those slain by famine, + Because these pine away, * pierced through for lack of the produce of the open field. י [ Yohdh ] 10 The very hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children. + They have become as bread of consolation to one during the breakdown of the daughter of my people. + כ [ Kaph ] 11 Jehovah has accomplished his rage. + He has poured out his burning anger. + And he sets a fire ablaze in Zion, which eats up her foundations. + ל [ Laʹmedh ] 12 The kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the productive land * had not believed + That the adversary and the enemy would come into the gates of Jerusalem. + מ [ Mem ] 13 Because of the sins of her prophets, the errors of her priests, + There were in the midst of her those pouring out the blood of righteous ones. + נ [ Nun ] 14 They have wandered about as blind + in the streets. + They have become polluted with blood, + So that none are able to touch their garments. + ס [ Saʹmekh ] 15 “Get out of the way! Unclean!” + they have called out to them. “Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Do not touch!” + For they have gone homeless. + They have also wandered about. + People have said among the nations: “They will not reside again as aliens. + פ [ Peʼ ] 16 The face of Jehovah has divided them up. + He will not look upon them again. + Men will certainly show no consideration even for the priests. + They will certainly show no favor even to the old men.” + ע [ ʽAʹyin ] 17 While we yet are, our eyes keep pining away in vain for assistance to us. + During our looking about we have looked out to a nation that can bring no salvation. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 18 They have hunted our steps + so that there is no walking in our public squares. Our end has drawn near. Our days have come to their full, for our end has come. + ק [ Qohph ] 19 Swifter than the eagles of the heavens our pursuers have proved to be. + Upon the mountains they have hotly pursued us. + In the wilderness they have lain in wait for us. + ר [ Rehsh ] 20 The very breath * of our nostrils, + the anointed one * of Jehovah, * + has been captured in their large pit, + The one of whom we have said: “In his shade + we shall live among the nations.” + ש [ Sin ] 21 Exult and rejoice, + O daughter of Eʹdom, + dwelling as you do in the land of Uz. + To you also the cup * will pass along. + You will become drunk and show yourself in nakedness. + ת [ Taw ] 22 Your error, O daughter of Zion, has come to its finish. + He will not * carry you off into exile again. + He has turned his attention to your error, O daughter of Eʹdom. He has uncovered your sins. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the stones of the sanctuary.” ^ Or, “O how the gold [Heb., za·havʹ ] becomes dim, how the good gold [Heb., hak· keʹthem ] changes!” See Job 28:16, 17 ftns. ^ “Against refined gold .” Heb., bap· pazʹ . ^ Lit., “flow forth,” evidently figuratively. ^ “The productive land.” Heb., the·velʹ; LXX, “the inhabited earth”; Lat., orʹbis, “the circle,” that is, of the earth. ^ Or, “spirit (wind).” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pneuʹma; Lat., spiʹri·tus . ^ “Anointed one of.” Heb., meshiʹach; Gr., khri·stosʹ; Syr., meshi·cheh; Lat., chriʹstus . ^ “The anointed Lord,” LXX Bagster Vg. ^ “The cup,” MSyVg; T, “the cup of cursing”; LXX, “the cup of Jehovah.” ^ Or, “No one will.” Previous Next Print Share Share
