No rest has been left for us. + 6 To Egypt + we have given the hand; + to As·syrʹi·a, + in order to get satisfaction with bread. 7 Our forefathers are the ones that have sinned. + They are no more. As for us, it is their errors that we have had to bear. + 8 Mere servants have ruled over us. + There is no one tearing us away from their hand. + 9 At the risk of our soul we bring in our bread, + because of the sword of the wilderness. 10 Our very skin has grown hot just like a furnace, because of the pangs of hunger. + 11 The wives * in Zion they have humbled, + the virgins in the cities of Judah. 12 Princes themselves have been hanged by just their hand. + The faces of even old men have not been honored. + 13 Even young men have lifted up a hand mill itself, + and under the wood mere boys have stumbled. + 14 Old men themselves have ceased even out of the gate, + young men from their instrumental music. + 15 The exultation of our heart has ceased. Our dancing has been changed into mere mourning. + 16 The crown of our head has fallen. + Woe, now, to us, because we have sinned! + 17 On this account our heart has become ill. + On account of these things our eyes have grown dim, + 18 On account of Zion’s mountain that is desolated; + foxes themselves have walked on it. + 19 As for you, O Jehovah, to time indefinite you will sit. + Your throne is for generation after generation. + 20 Why is it that forever you forget us, + that you leave us for the length of days? + 21 Bring us back, + O Jehovah, to yourself, and we shall readily come back. Bring new days for us as in the long ago. + 22 However, you have positively rejected us. + You have been indignant toward us very much. + Footnotes ^ This chapter is not an alphabetic acrostic like each of the preceding four chapters, but it does have 22 vss to correspond to the 22 letters of the Heb. alphabet. ^ Or, “silver.” ^ Or, “women.” Previous Next Print Share Share
