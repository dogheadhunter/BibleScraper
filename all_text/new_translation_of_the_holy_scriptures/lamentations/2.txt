In his fury he has torn down the fortified places + of the daughter of Judah. He has brought into contact with the earth, + he has profaned the kingdom + and her princes. + ג [ Giʹmel ] 3 In the heat of anger he has cut down every horn of Israel. + He has turned his right hand back from before the enemy; + And in Jacob he keeps burning like a flaming fire that has devoured all around. + ד [ Daʹleth ] 4 He has trodden his bow like an enemy. + His right hand + has taken its position Like an adversary, + and he kept killing all those desirable to the eyes. + Into the tent + of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his rage, just like fire. + ה [ He ʼ] 5 Jehovah * has become like an enemy. + He has swallowed down Israel. + He has swallowed down all her dwelling towers; + he has brought his fortified places to ruin. + And in the daughter of Judah he makes mourning and lamentation abound. + ו [ Waw ] 6 And he treats his booth + violently like that in a garden. + He has brought his festival to ruin. Jehovah has caused to be forgotten in Zion festival + and sabbath, And in his angry denunciation he shows no respect for king and priest. + ז [ Zaʹyin ] 7 Jehovah * has cast off his altar. + He has spurned his sanctuary. + Into the hand of the enemy he has surrendered the walls of her dwelling towers. + In the house of Jehovah they have let out [their] own voice, as in the day of a festival. + ח [ Chehth ] 8 Jehovah has thought of bringing the wall + of the daughter of Zion to ruin. He has stretched out the measuring line. + He has not turned back his hand from swallowing up. + And he causes rampart and wall to go mourning. + Together they have faded away. ט [ Tehth ] 9 Her gates + have sunk down into the very earth. He has destroyed and broken her bars in pieces. Her king and her princes are among the nations. + There is no law. + Her own prophets also have found no vision from Jehovah. + י [ Yohdh ] 10 The older men of the daughter of Zion sit down on the earth, [where] they keep silence. + They have brought up dust upon their head. + They have girded on sackcloth. + The virgins of Jerusalem have brought their head down to the very earth. + כ [ Kaph ] 11 My eyes have come to their end in sheer tears. + My intestines are in a ferment. + My liver has been poured out to the very earth, + on account of the crash of the daughter of my people, + Because of the fainting away of child and suckling in the public squares of the town. + ל [ Laʹmedh ] 12 To their mothers they kept saying: “Where are grain and wine?” + Because of their fainting away like someone slain in the public squares of the city, Because of their soul being poured out into the bosom of their mothers. מ [ Mem ] 13 Of what shall I use you as a witness? What shall I liken to you, O daughter of Jerusalem? + What shall I make equal to you, that I may comfort you, O virgin daughter of Zion? + For your breakdown + is just as great as the sea. Who can bring healing to you? + נ [ Nun ] 14 Your own prophets have visioned for you worthless and unsatisfying things, + And they have not uncovered your error in order to turn back your captivity, + But they kept visioning for you worthless and misleading pronouncements. + ס [ Saʹmekh ] 15 At you all those passing along on the road have clapped their hands. + They have whistled + and kept wagging their head + at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying:] “Is this the city of which they used to say, ‘It is the perfection of prettiness, an exultation for all the earth’?” + פ [ Peʼ ] * 16 At you all your enemies have opened their mouth. + They have whistled and kept grinding the teeth. + They have said: “We will swallow [her] * down. + This indeed is the day that we have hoped for. + We have found! We have seen!” + ע [ ʽAʹyin ] * 17 Jehovah has done what he had in mind. + He has accomplished his saying, + What he had commanded from the days of long ago. + He has torn down and shown no compassion. + And over you he causes the enemy to rejoice. + He has made the horn of your adversaries high. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 18 Their heart has cried out to Jehovah, * + O wall of the daughter of Zion. + Cause tears to descend just like a torrent day and night. + Give no numbness to yourself. May the pupil * of your eye not keep quiet. ק [ Qohph ] 19 Rise up! Whine during the night at the start of the morning watches. + Pour out your heart + before the face + of Jehovah * just like water. Raise to him your palms + on account of the soul of your children, Who are fainting away because of famine at the head of all the streets. + ר [ Rehsh ] 20 See, O Jehovah, and do look + to the one to whom you have dealt severely in this manner. Should the women keep eating their own fruitage, the children born fully formed, + Or in the sanctuary of Jehovah * should priest and prophet be killed? + ש [ Shin ] 21 Boy and old man + have lain down on the earth of the streets. + My virgins and my young men themselves have fallen by the sword. + You have killed in the day of your anger. + You have slaughtered; + you have had no compassion. + ת [ Taw ] 22 As in the day of a festival + you proceeded to call out my places of alien residence all around. And in the day of the wrath of Jehovah there proved to be no escapee or survivor; + Those whom I brought forth fully formed and reared, my enemy himself exterminated them. + Footnotes ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
