And who is adequately qualified for these things? + 17 [We are;] for we are not peddlers * of the word of God + as many men are, + but as out of sincerity, yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ, we are speaking. + Footnotes ^ Or, “those who commercialize (make gain); adulterators.” Previous Next Print Share Share
