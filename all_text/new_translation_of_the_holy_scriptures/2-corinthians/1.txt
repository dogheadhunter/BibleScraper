This was that we might have our trust, + not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead. + 10 From such a great thing as death he did rescue us and will rescue us; + and our hope is in him that he will also rescue us further. + 11 Y OU also can help along by YOUR supplication for us, + in order that thanks + may be given by many in our behalf for what is kindly given to us due to many [prayerful] faces. + 12 For the thing we boast of is this, to which our conscience bears witness, + that with holiness and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom + but with God’s undeserved kindness, we have conducted ourselves in the world, but more especially toward YOU . 13 For we are really not writing YOU things except those which YOU well know * or also recognize; and which I hope YOU will continue to recognize to the end, + 14 just as YOU have also recognized, to an extent, that we are a cause for YOU to boast, + just as YOU will also be for us in the day of our Lord Jesus. + 15 So, with this confidence, I was intending before to come to YOU , + that YOU might have a second + [occasion for] joy, 16 and after a stopover with YOU to go to Mac·e·doʹni·a, + and to come back from Mac·e·doʹni·a to YOU + and be conducted + partway by YOU to Ju·deʹa. 17 Well, when I had such an intention, I did not indulge in any lightness, + did I? Or what things I purpose, do I purpose [them] according to the flesh, + that with me there should be “Yes, Yes” and “No, No”? + 18 But God can be relied upon that our speech addressed to YOU is not Yes and yet No. * 19 For the Son of God, + Christ Jesus, who was preached among YOU through us, that is, through me and Sil·vaʹnus and Timothy, + did not become Yes and yet No, but Yes has become Yes in his case. + 20 For no matter how many the promises + of God are, they have become Yes by means of him. * + Therefore also through him is the “Amen” + [said] to God for glory through us. 21 But he who guarantees that YOU and we belong to Christ and he who has anointed + us is God. 22 He has also put his seal + upon us and has given us the token + of what is to come, * that is, the spirit, + in our hearts. 23 Now I call upon God as a witness + against my own soul that it is to spare YOU + that I have not yet come to Corinth. 24 Not that we are the masters + over YOUR faith, but we are fellow workers + for YOUR joy, for it is by [ YOUR ] faith + that YOU are standing. + Footnotes ^ The Roman province of southern Greece with its capital at Corinth. ^ Lit., “you are reading.” ^ Or, “Yes and No in one breath.” Lit., “Yes and No.” Gr., Nai kai Ou; Lat., EST et NON ; J 17,​18 (Heb.), Hen wa·Loʼʹ . ^ “By means of him.” Or, “in him.” ^ Or, “earnest money (down payment) of what is to come.” Gr., ar·ra·boʹna .
