However, I hope that we have been made manifest also to YOUR consciences. + 12 We are not again recommending + ourselves to YOU , but giving YOU an inducement for boasting in respect to us, + that YOU may have [an answer] for those who boast over the outward appearance + but not over the heart. + 13 For if we were out of our mind, + it was for God; if we are sound in mind, + it is for YOU . 14 For the love the Christ has * compels us, because this is what we have judged, that one man died for all; + so, then, all had died; 15 and he died for all that those who live might live no longer for themselves, + but for him + who died for them and was raised up. + 16 Consequently from now on we know no man according to the flesh. + Even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, + certainly we now know him so no more. + 17 Consequently if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new creation; * + the old things passed away, + look! new things have come into existence. + 18 But all things are from God, who reconciled + us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry + of the reconciliation, 19 namely, that God was by means of Christ + reconciling a world + to himself, + not reckoning to them their trespasses, + and he committed the word + of the reconciliation to us. + 20 We + are therefore ambassadors + substituting for * Christ, + as though God were making entreaty through us. + As substitutes for Christ we beg: + “Become reconciled to God.” 21 The one who did not know sin + he made to be sin * + for us, that we might become God’s righteousness + by means of him.
