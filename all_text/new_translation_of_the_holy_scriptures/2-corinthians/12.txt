It is not beneficial; but I shall pass on to supernatural visions + and revelations of [the] Lord. 2 I know a man in union with Christ who, fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know; God knows—was caught away + as such to the third heaven. 3 Yes, I know such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body, + I do not know, * God knows— 4 that he was caught away into paradise * + and heard unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to speak. 5 Over such a man * I will boast, but I will not boast over myself, except as respects [my] weaknesses. + 6 For if I ever do want to boast, + I shall not be unreasonable, for I shall say the truth. But I abstain, in order that no one should put to my credit more than what he sees I am or he hears from me, 7 just because of the excess * of the revelations. Therefore, that I might not feel overly exalted, + there was given me a thorn * in the flesh, + an angel of Satan, to keep slapping me, that I might not be overly exalted. 8 In this behalf I three times + entreated the Lord that it might depart from me; 9 and yet he really said to me: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient + for you; for [my] power is being made perfect in weakness.” + Most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast as respects my weaknesses, + that the power of the Christ may like a tent remain over me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in cases of need, in persecutions and difficulties, for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful. + 11 I have become unreasonable. Y OU compelled me + to, for I ought to have been recommended by YOU . For I did not prove to be inferior to [ YOUR ] superfine + apostles in a single thing, even if I am nothing. + 12 Indeed, the signs of an apostle + were produced among YOU by all endurance, + and by signs and portents and powerful works. * + 13 For in what respect is it that YOU became less than the rest of the congregations, except that I myself did not become a burden to YOU ? + Kindly forgive me this wrong. 14 Look! This is the third time + I am ready to come to YOU , and yet I will not become a burden. For I am seeking, not YOUR possessions, + but YOU ; for the children + ought not to lay up for [their] parents, but the parents for [their] children. + 15 For my part I will most gladly spend and be completely spent for YOUR souls. + If I love YOU the more abundantly, am I to be loved the less? 16 But be that as it may, I did not burden YOU down. + Nevertheless, YOU say, I was “crafty” and I caught YOU “by trickery.” + 17 As for any one of those I have dispatched to YOU , I did not take advantage of YOU through him, did I? 18 I urged Titus and I dispatched the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of YOU at all, did he? + We walked in the same spirit, + did we not? In the same footsteps, did we not? 19 Have YOU been thinking all this while that we have been making our defense to YOU ? It is before God that we are speaking in connection with Christ. But, beloved ones, all things are for YOUR upbuilding. + 20 For I am afraid that somehow, when I arrive, + I may find YOU not as I could wish and I may prove to be to YOU not as YOU could wish, but, instead, there should somehow be strife, jealousy, + cases of anger, contentions, backbitings, whisperings, cases of being puffed up, disorders. + 21 Perhaps, when I come again, my God might humiliate me among YOU , and I might mourn over many of those who formerly sinned + but have not repented over their uncleanness * and fornication * + and loose conduct * + that they have practiced.
