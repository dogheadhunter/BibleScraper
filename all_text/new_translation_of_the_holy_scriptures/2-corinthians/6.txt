Now is the especially acceptable time. + Look! Now is the day of salvation. + 3 In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, + that our ministry might not be found fault with; + 4 but in every way we recommend + ourselves as God’s ministers, * by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by cases of need, by difficulties, + 5 by beatings, by prisons, + by disorders, by labors, by sleepless nights, by times without food, + 6 by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, + by kindness, + by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy, + 7 by truthful speech, by God’s power; + through the weapons + of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, * 8 through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report; as deceivers + and yet truthful, 9 as being unknown and yet being recognized, + as dying and yet, look! we live, + as disciplined + and yet not delivered to death, + 10 as sorrowing but ever rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. + 11 Our mouth has been opened to YOU , Corinthians, our heart + has widened out. 12 Y OU are not cramped for room within us, + but YOU are cramped for room in YOUR own tender affections. + 13 So, as a recompense in return—I speak as to children + — YOU , too, widen out. 14 Do not become unevenly yoked * with unbelievers. + For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? + Or what sharing does light have with darkness? + 15 Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Beʹli·al? * + Or what portion + does a faithful * person have with an unbeliever? 16 And what agreement does God’s temple * have with idols? + For we are a temple + of a living God; just as God said: “I shall reside among them + and walk among [them], and I shall be their God, and they will be my people.” + 17 “‘Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, * ‘and quit touching the unclean thing’”; + “‘and I will take YOU in.’” + 18 “‘And I shall be a father to YOU , + and YOU will be sons and daughters to me,’ + says Jehovah * the Almighty.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “servants.” Gr., di·aʹko·noi; Lat., mi·niʹstros (from miʹnus, “less”); J 18,​22 (Heb.), ki m·sha·rethehʹ , “as attendants of.” ^ Or, “for offense and defense.” ^ Lit., “being differently yoked.” ^ “Belial,” Vg; P 46 א BC, “Beliar”; Sy p , “Satan.” ^ Or, “believing.” ^ Or, “divine habitation (dwelling).” Gr., na·oiʹ, dative, sing.; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), le heh·khalʹ , “to the palace ( temple ) of.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D .
