But through the spirit + they repeatedly told Paul not to set foot in Jerusalem. 5 So when we had completed the days, we went forth and started on our way; but they all, together with the women and children, conducted us as far as outside the city. And kneeling + down on the beach we had prayer 6 and said good-bye + to one another, and we went up into the boat but they returned to their homes. 7 We then completed the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptol·e·maʹis, and we greeted the brothers and stayed one day with them. 8 The next day we set out and arrived in Caes·a·reʹa, + and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelizer, * who was one of the seven men, + and we stayed with him. 9 This man had four daughters, virgins, that prophesied. + 10 But while we were remaining quite a number of days, a certain prophet named Agʹa·bus + came down from Ju·deʹa, 11 and he came to us and took up the girdle of Paul, bound his own feet and hands and said: “Thus says the holy spirit, ‘The man to whom this girdle belongs the Jews will bind + in this manner in Jerusalem and deliver + into the hands of people of the nations.’” 12 Now when we heard this, both we and those of that place began entreating him not to go + up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered: “What are YOU doing by weeping + and making me weak at heart? + Rest assured, I am ready not only to be bound but also to die + at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” 14 When he would not be dissuaded, we acquiesced with the words: “Let the will + of Jehovah * take place.” 15 Now after these days we prepared for the journey and began going up to Jerusalem. + 16 But some of the disciples from Caes·a·reʹa + also went with us, to bring us to the man at whose home we were to be entertained, a certain Mnaʹson of Cyʹprus, an early disciple. 17 When we got into Jerusalem, + the brothers received us gladly. + 18 But on the following [day] Paul went in with us to James; + and all the older men * were present. * 19 And he greeted them and began giving in detail an account + of the things God did among the nations through his ministry. + 20 After hearing this they began to glorify God, and they said to him: “You behold, brother, how many thousands * of believers there are among the Jews; and they are all zealous for the Law. + 21 But they have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations an apostasy * from Moses, + telling them neither to circumcise + their children nor to walk in the [solemn] customs. 22 What, then, is to be done about it? In any case they are going to hear you have arrived. 23 Therefore do this which we tell you: We have four men with a vow upon themselves. 24 Take these men along + and cleanse yourself ceremonially with them and take care of their expenses, + that they may have their heads shaved. + And so everybody will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you, but that you are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law. + 25 As for the believers from among the nations, we have sent out, * rendering our decision that they should keep themselves from what is sacrificed to idols + as well as from blood + and what is strangled * + and from fornication.” + 26 Then Paul took the men along the next day and cleansed himself ceremonially with them + and went into the temple, to give notice of the days to be fulfilled + for the ceremonial cleansing, until the offering + should be presented for each one of them. + 27 Now when the seven + days were about to be concluded, the Jews from Asia on beholding him in the temple began to throw all the crowd into confusion, + and they laid their hands upon him, 28 crying out: “Men of Israel, help! This is the man that teaches everybody everywhere against the people + and the Law and this place and, what is more, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.” + 29 For they had previously seen Trophʹi·mus + the E·pheʹsian in the city with him, but they were imagining Paul had brought him into the temple. 30 And the whole city was set in an uproar, + and a running together of the people occurred; and they laid hold of Paul and dragged him outside the temple. + And immediately the doors were closed. 31 And while they were seeking to kill him, information came up to the commander * of the band that all Jerusalem was in confusion; + 32 and he at once took soldiers and army officers * and ran down to them. + When they caught sight of the military commander + and the soldiers, they quit beating Paul. 33 Then the military commander came near and took hold of him and gave command for him to be bound with two chains; + and he proceeded to inquire who he might be and what he had done. 34 But some in the crowd began shouting out one thing, and others another. + So, being unable himself to learn anything certain because of the tumult, he commanded him to be brought to the soldiers’ quarters. + 35 But when he got upon the stairs, the situation became such that he was being carried along by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd; 36 for the multitude of the people kept following, crying out: “Take him away!” * + 37 And as he was about to be led into the soldiers’ quarters, Paul said to the military commander: “Am I allowed to say something to you?” He said: “Can you speak Greek? 38 Are you not really the Egyptian who before these days stirred up a sedition + and led the four thousand dagger * men out into the wilderness?” 39 Then Paul said: “I am, in fact, a Jew, + of Tarsus + in Ci·liʹcia, a citizen of no obscure city. So I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.” 40 After he gave permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, motioned + with his hand to the people. When a great silence fell, he addressed them in the Hebrew + language, saying: Footnotes ^ Or, “missionary.” Gr., eu·ag·ge·li·stouʹ; Lat., e·van·ge·liʹstae . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “elders.” ^ Or, “came there.” ^ Lit., “myriads; tens of thousands.” ^ “An apostasy.” Gr., a·po·sta·siʹan (from the verb a·phiʹste·mi, “stand away from”).
