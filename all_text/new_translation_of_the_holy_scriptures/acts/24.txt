But there were certain Jews from the [district of] Asia, 19 who ought to be present before you and to accuse me if they might have anything against me. + 20 Or, let the [men] here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanʹhe·drin, 21 except with respect to this one utterance which I cried out while standing among them, ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before YOU !’” + 22 However, Felix, + knowing quite accurately the matters concerning this Way, + began to put the [men] off and said: “Whenever Lysʹi·as + the military commander * comes down, I shall decide upon these matters involving YOU .” 23 And he ordered the army officer * that the man be kept and have some relaxation [of custody], and that he forbid no one of his people to wait upon him. + 24 Some days later Felix + arrived with Dru·silʹla his wife, who was a Jewess, + and he sent for Paul and listened to him on the belief in Christ Jesus. + 25 But as he talked about righteousness + and self-control + and the judgment + to come, Felix became frightened and answered: “For the present go your way, but when I get an opportune time I shall send for you again.” 26 At the same time, though, he was hoping for money + to be given him by Paul. On that account he sent for him even more frequently and would converse with him. + 27 But, when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor + with the Jews, he left Paul bound.
