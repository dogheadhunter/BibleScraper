But they were closely watching also the gates both day and night in order to do away with him. + 25 So his disciples took him and let him down by night through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket. + 26 On arriving in Jerusalem + he made efforts to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe he was a disciple. 27 So Barʹna·bas came to his aid + and led him to the apostles, and he told them in detail how on the road he had seen the Lord + and that he had spoken to him, + and how in Damascus + he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. 28 And he continued with them, walking in and out * at Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord; + 29 and he was talking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews. * But these made attempts to do away with him. + 30 When the brothers detected this, they brought him down to Caes·a·reʹa and sent him off to Tarsus. + 31 Then, indeed, the congregation + throughout the whole of Ju·deʹa and Galʹi·lee and Sa·marʹi·a entered into a period of peace, being built up; and as it walked in the fear of Jehovah * + and in the comfort of the holy spirit + it kept on multiplying. 32 Now as Peter was going through all [parts] he came down also to the holy ones * that dwelt in Lydʹda. + 33 There he found a certain man named Ae·neʹas, who had been lying flat on his cot for eight years, as he was paralyzed. 34 And Peter said to him: + “Ae·neʹas, Jesus Christ heals you. + Rise and make up your bed.” And he rose immediately. 35 And all those who inhabited Lydʹda and the [plain of] Sharʹon * + saw him, and these turned to the Lord. + 36 But in Jopʹpa + there was a certain disciple named Tabʹi·tha, which, when translated, means Dorʹcas. * She abounded in good deeds + and gifts of mercy that she was rendering. 37 But in those days she happened to fall sick and die. So they bathed her and laid her in an upper chamber. 38 Now as Lydʹda was near Jopʹpa, + when the disciples heard that Peter was in this city they dispatched two men to him to entreat [him]: “Please do not hesitate * to come on as far as us.” 39 At that Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they led him up into the upper chamber; and all the widows presented themselves to him weeping and exhibiting many inner garments and outer garments + that Dorʹcas used to make while she was with them. + 40 But Peter put everybody outside + and, bending his knees, he prayed, and, turning to the body, he said: “Tabʹi·tha, * rise!” She opened her eyes and, as she caught sight of Peter, she sat up. + 41 Giving her his hand, he raised her up, + and he called the holy ones and the widows and presented her alive. + 42 This became known throughout all Jopʹpa, and many became believers on the Lord. + 43 For quite a few days he remained in Jopʹpa + with a certain Simon, a tanner. + Footnotes ^ “The Way .” Gr., tes ho·douʹ . ^ “In a vision,” BCSy h,p Arm; P 74 א AVg omit. ^ Or, “your saints.” ^ Or, “carrying on his daily life.” ^ Lit., “the Hellenists.” J 17 , “the Grecian Jews.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “the saints.” ^ “Sharon,” J 17,​18,​22 ; א AB, “Saron.” ^ “Dorcas” (Gr.) corresponds with “Tabitha” (Aram.); both names mean “Gazelle.” ^ Or, “do not delay.” ^ See vs 36 ftn.
