We also are humans + having the same infirmities + as YOU do, and are declaring the good news to YOU , for YOU to turn from these vain + things to the living God, + who made the heaven + and the earth and the sea and all the things in them. 16 In the past generations he permitted all the nations to go on in their ways, + 17 although, indeed, he did not leave himself without witness in that he did good, + giving YOU rains + from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling YOUR hearts to the full with food and good cheer.” + 18 And yet by saying these things they scarcely restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them. 19 But Jews arrived from Antioch and I·coʹni·um and persuaded the crowds, + and they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, imagining he was dead. + 20 However, when the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he left with Barʹna·bas for Derʹbe. + 21 And after declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples, + they returned to Lysʹtra and to I·coʹni·um and to Antioch, 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, + encouraging them to remain in the faith and [saying]: “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.” + 23 Moreover, they appointed * older men + for them in each congregation and, offering prayer with fastings, + they committed them to Jehovah * + in whom they had become believers. 24 And they went through Pi·sidʹi·a and came into Pam·phylʹi·a, + 25 and, after speaking the word * in Perga, they went down to At·ta·liʹa. 26 And from there they sailed off for Antioch, + where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of God for the work they had fully performed. + 27 When they had arrived and had gathered the congregation together, they proceeded to relate + the many things God had done by means of them, and that he had opened to the nations the door to * faith. + 28 So they spent not a little time with the disciples.
