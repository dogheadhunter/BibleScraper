But these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man. + 13 “He reported to us how he saw the angel stand in his house and say, ‘Dispatch men to Jopʹpa and send for Simon who is surnamed Peter, + 14 and he will speak those things to you by which you and all your household may get saved.’ + 15 But when I started to speak, the holy spirit fell upon them just as it did also upon us in [the] beginning. + 16 At this I called to mind the saying of the Lord, how he used to say, ‘John, for his part, baptized with water, + but YOU will be baptized in holy spirit.’ + 17 If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them as he also did to us who have believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, + who was I that I should be able to hinder God?” + 18 Now when they heard these things, they acquiesced, + and they glorified God, + saying: “Well, then, God has granted repentance for the purpose of life to people of the nations also.” + 19 Consequently those who had been scattered + by the tribulation that arose over Stephen went through as far as Phoe·niʹcia + and Cyʹprus + and Antioch, but speaking the word to no one except to Jews only. + 20 However, out of them there were some men of Cyʹprus and Cy·reʹne that came to Antioch and began talking to the Greek-speaking people, * + declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus. + 21 Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah * + was with them, and a great number that became believers turned to the Lord. + 22 The account about them got to the ears of the congregation that was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barʹna·bas + as far as Antioch. 23 When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness + of God, he rejoiced + and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with hearty purpose; + 24 for he was a good man and full of holy spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord. + 25 So he went off to Tarsus + to make a thorough search for Saul + 26 and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called * Christians. * + 27 Now in these days prophets + came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 28 One of them named Agʹa·bus + rose and proceeded to indicate through the spirit that a great famine was about to come upon the entire inhabited earth; + which, for that matter, did take place in the time of Claudius. 29 So those of the disciples determined, each of them according as anyone could afford it, + to send a relief + ministration to the brothers dwelling in Ju·deʹa; 30 and this they did, dispatching it to the older men * by the hand of Barʹna·bas and Saul. + Footnotes ^ “Greek-speaking people.” Lit., “Hellenists.” AD * , “Greeks.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “named.” ^ “Christians.” Gr., Khri·sti·a·nousʹ; Lat., Chri·sti·aʹni; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), Meshi·chi·yimʹ, “Messia­nists.” ^ Or, “elders.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹrous .
