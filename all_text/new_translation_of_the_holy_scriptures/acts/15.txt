+ 11 On the contrary, we trust to get saved through the undeserved kindness + of the Lord Jesus in the same way as those people also.” + 12 At that the entire multitude became silent, and they began to listen to Barʹna·bas and Paul relate the many signs and portents that God did through them among the nations. + 13 After they quit speaking, James answered, saying: “Men, brothers, hear me. + 14 Symʹe·on * + has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name. + 15 And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, 16 ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth * of David that is fallen down; and I shall rebuild its ruins and erect it again, + 17 in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, * together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, * says Jehovah, * who is doing these things, + 18 known from of old.’ * + 19 Hence my decision is not to trouble those from the nations who are turning to God, + 20 but to write them to abstain * from things polluted by idols + and from fornication * + and from what is strangled * + and from blood. * + 21 For from ancient times * Moses has had in city after city those who preach him, because he is read aloud in the synagogues on every sabbath.” + 22 Then the apostles and the older men * together with the whole congregation favored sending chosen men from among them to Antioch along with Paul and Barʹna·bas, namely, Judas who was called Barʹsab·bas + and Silas, leading men among the brothers; 23 and by their hand they wrote: “The apostles and the older men, brothers, to those brothers in Antioch + and Syria and Ci·liʹcia + who are from the nations: Greetings! 24 Since we have heard that some from among us have caused YOU trouble with speeches, + trying to subvert YOUR souls, although we did not give them any instructions, + 25 we have come to a unanimous accord * + and have favored choosing men to send to YOU together with our loved ones, Barʹna·bas and Paul, + 26 men that have delivered up their souls * for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. + 27 We are therefore dispatching Judas and Silas, + that they also may report the same things by word. + 28 For the holy spirit + and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden + to YOU , except these necessary things, 29 to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols + and from blood + and from things strangled * + and from fornication. * + If YOU carefully keep yourselves from these things, + YOU will prosper. Good health to YOU !” * 30 Accordingly, when these men were let go, they went down to Antioch, and they gathered the multitude together and handed them the letter. + 31 After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement. + 32 And Judas and Silas, since they themselves were also prophets, + encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them. + 33 So, when they had passed some time, they were let go in peace + by the brothers to those who had sent them out. 34 * —— 35 However, Paul and Barʹna·bas continued spending time in Antioch + teaching and declaring, with many others also, the good news of the word of Jehovah. * + 36 Now after some days Paul said to Barʹna·bas: “Above all things, let us return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities in which we published the word of Jehovah * to see how they are.” + 37 For his part, Barʹna·bas was determined to take along also John, who was called Mark. + 38 But Paul did not think it proper to be taking this one along with them, seeing that he had departed from them from Pam·phylʹi·a + and had not gone with them to the work. 39 At this there occurred a sharp burst of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barʹna·bas + took Mark along and sailed away to Cyʹprus. + 40 Paul selected Silas + and went off after he had been entrusted by the brothers to the undeserved kindness of Jehovah. * + 41 But he went through Syria and Ci·liʹcia, strengthening the congregations. + Footnotes ^ Or, “elders.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹrous; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), wehaz· zeqe·nimʹ , “and the older men .” See Nu 11:25 ftn, “Men.” ^ Lit., “turning upon.” Gr., e·pi·stro·phenʹ; Lat., con·ver·si·oʹnem . ^ A Heb. form of the name Simon (Peter).
