Moreover, even my flesh will reside in hope; + 27 because you will not leave my soul in Haʹdes, * neither will you allow your loyal one to see corruption. + 28 You have made life’s ways known to me, you will fill me with good cheer with your face.’ + 29 “Men, brothers, it is allowable to speak with freeness of speech to YOU concerning the family head David, that he both deceased + and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day. 30 Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God * had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one from the fruitage of his loins * upon his throne, + 31 he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Haʹdes nor did his flesh see corruption. + 32 This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. + 33 Therefore because he was exalted to * the right hand of God + and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, + he has poured out this which YOU see and hear. 34 Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, + but he himself says, ‘Jehovah * said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, + 35 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’ + 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord + and Christ, this Jesus whom YOU impaled.” * + 37 Now when they heard this they were stabbed to the heart, + and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Men, brothers, what shall we do?” + 38 Peter [said] to them: “Repent, + and let each one of YOU be baptized + in the name + of Jesus Christ for forgiveness + of YOUR sins, and YOU will receive the free gift + of the holy spirit. 39 For the promise + is to YOU and to YOUR children and to all those afar off, + just as many as Jehovah * our God may call to him.” + 40 And with many other words he bore thorough witness and kept exhorting them, saying: “Get saved from this crooked generation.” + 41 Therefore those who embraced his word heartily were baptized, + and on that day about three thousand souls were added. + 42 And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to sharing [with one another], * + to taking of meals * + and to prayers. + 43 Indeed, fear began to fall upon every soul, and many portents and signs began to occur through the apostles. + 44 All those who became believers were together in having all things in common, + 45 and they went selling their possessions + and properties and distributing the [proceeds] to all, just as anyone would have the need. + 46 And day after day they were in constant attendance at the temple with one accord, + and they took their meals in private homes * and partook of food with great rejoicing + and sincerity of heart, 47 praising God and finding favor with all the people. + At the same time Jehovah * continued to join + to them daily those being saved. + Footnotes ^ Or, “converts.” ^ That is, about 9 a.m., counting from sunrise. ^ Or, “elders.” Gr., pre·sbyʹte·roi . ^ Or, “upon all flesh .” Gr., e·piʹ paʹsan sarʹka ; Lat., carʹnem ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ba·sarʹ . ^ Or, “active force.” Gr., pneuʹma·tos; Lat., Spiʹri·tu; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ru·ch iʹ, “my spirit .” See Ge 1:2 ftn, “Force.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ “Hades,” א AB; J 7,​8,​11-18,​22 , “Sheol.” See App 4B . ^ “God,” א AB; J 7,​8,​10 , “Jehovah.” ^ Or, “one of his offspring.” ^ Or, “by.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “fastened on a stake (pole).” See App 5C . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “association together.” ^ Lit., “to the breaking of the bread.” ^ Or, “from house to house.” Gr., katʼ oiʹkon .
