I know that all of YOU among whom I went preaching * the kingdom * will see my face no more. 26 Hence I call YOU to witness this very day that I am clean from the blood + of all men, 27 for I have not held back from telling YOU all the counsel + of God. 28 Pay attention + to yourselves + and to all the flock, + among which the holy spirit has appointed YOU overseers, * + to shepherd the congregation of God, * + which he purchased with the blood + of his own [Son]. * 29 I know that after my going away oppressive wolves + will enter in among YOU and will not treat the flock with tenderness, 30 and from among YOU yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things + to draw away the disciples after themselves. + 31 “Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that for three years, + night and day, I did not quit admonishing + each one with tears. 32 And now I commit YOU to God * + and to the word of his undeserved kindness, which [word] can build YOU up + and give YOU the inheritance among all the sanctified ones. + 33 I have coveted no man’s silver or gold or apparel. + 34 Y OU yourselves know that these hands have attended to the needs of me + and of those with me. 35 I have exhibited to YOU in all things that by thus laboring + YOU must assist those who are weak, + and must bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving + than there is in receiving.’” 36 And when he had said these things, he kneeled + down with all of them and prayed. 37 Indeed, quite a bit of weeping broke out among them all, and they fell upon Paul’s neck + and tenderly kissed + him, 38 because they were especially pained at the word he had spoken that they were going to behold his face + no more. So they proceeded to conduct + him to the boat.
