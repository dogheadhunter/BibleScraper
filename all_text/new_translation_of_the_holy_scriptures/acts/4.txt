And they began to recognize about them that they used to be with Jesus; + 14 and as they were looking at the man that had been cured standing with them, + they had nothing to say in rebuttal. + 15 So they commanded them to go outside the Sanʹhe·drin hall, and they began consulting with one another, 16 saying: “What shall we do with these men? + Because, for a fact, a noteworthy sign has occurred through them, one manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; + and we cannot deny it. 17 Nevertheless, in order that it may not be spread abroad further among the people, let us tell them with threats not to speak anymore upon the basis of this name to any man at all.” + 18 With that they called them and charged them, nowhere to make any utterance or to teach upon the basis of the name of Jesus. 19 But in reply Peter and John said to them: “Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to YOU rather than to God, judge for yourselves. 20 But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” + 21 So, when they had further threatened them, they released them, since they did not find any ground on which to punish them and on account of the people, + because they were all glorifying God over what had occurred; 22 for the man upon whom this sign of healing had occurred was more than forty years old. 23 After being released they went to their own people + and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. 24 Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God + and said: “Sovereign + Lord, * you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, + 25 and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, + your servant, ‘Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? + 26 The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah * and against his anointed one.’ * + 27 Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate + with [men of] nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy + servant Jesus, whom you anointed, * + 28 in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. + 29 And now, Jehovah, * give attention to their threats, + and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, + 30 while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents + occur through the name + of your holy servant + Jesus.” 31 And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; + and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit + and were speaking the word of God with boldness. + 32 Moreover, the multitude of those who had believed had one heart and soul, + and not even one would say that any of the things he possessed was his own; but they had all things in common. + 33 Also, with great power the apostles continued giving forth the witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; + and undeserved kindness in large measure was upon them all. 34 In fact, there was not one in need among them; + for all those who were possessors of fields or houses would sell them and bring the values of the things sold 35 and they would deposit them at the feet of the apostles. + In turn distribution + would be made to each one, just as he would have the need. 36 So Joseph, who was surnamed Barʹna·bas + by the apostles, which means, when translated, Son of Comfort, a Levite, a native of Cyʹprus, 37 possessing a piece of land, sold it and brought the money and deposited it at the feet of the apostles. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “while they.” ^ Or, “elders.” Gr., tous pre·sby·teʹrous . ^ Or, “has been saved.” ^ Or, “in this name.” ^ Or, “fastened on a stake (pole).” See App 5C . ^ “Sovereign Lord.” Gr., Deʹspo·ta; Lat., Doʹmi·ne; J 17,​18 (Heb.), ʼAdho·naiʹ .
