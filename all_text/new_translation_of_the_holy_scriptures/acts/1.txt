This Jesus who was received up from YOU into the sky will come thus in the same manner + as YOU have beheld him going into the sky.” * 12 Then they returned + to Jerusalem from a mountain called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, being a sabbath day’s journey * away. + 13 So, when they had entered, they went up into the upper chamber, + where they were staying, Peter as well as John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bar·tholʹo·mew and Matthew, James [the son] of Al·phaeʹus and Simon the zealous one, * and Judas [the son] of James. + 14 With one accord all these were persisting in prayer, + together with some women + and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. + 15 Now during these days Peter rose up in the midst of the brothers and said (the crowd * of persons was all together about one hundred and twenty): 16 “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled, + which the holy spirit + spoke beforehand by David’s mouth about Judas, + who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus, + 17 because he had been numbered among us + and he obtained a share in this ministry. + 18 (This very man, therefore, purchased + a field with the wages for unrighteousness, + and pitching head foremost * + he noisily burst in his midst and all his intestines were poured out. 19 It also became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their language A·kelʹda·ma, that is, Field of Blood.) 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his lodging place become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it,’ + and, ‘His office of oversight * let someone else take.’ + 21 It is therefore necessary that of the men that assembled with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out * among us, + 22 starting with his baptism by John + and until the day he was received up from us, + one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection.” + 23 So they put up two, Joseph called Barʹsab·bas, who was surnamed Justus, and Mat·thiʹas. 24 And they prayed and said: “You, O Jehovah, * who know the hearts of all, + designate which one of these two men you have chosen, 25 to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, + from which Judas deviated to go to his own place.” 26 So they cast lots + over them, and the lot fell upon Mat·thiʹas; and he was reckoned along with the eleven + apostles.
