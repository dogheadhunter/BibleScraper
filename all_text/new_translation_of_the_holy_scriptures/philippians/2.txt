13 for God is the one that, for the sake of [his] good pleasure, is acting within YOU + in order for YOU both to will and to act. + 14 Keep doing all things free from murmurings + and arguments, * + 15 that YOU may come to be blameless + and innocent, children + of God without a blemish in among a crooked and twisted generation, + among whom YOU are shining as illuminators in the world, + 16 keeping a tight grip on the word of life, + that I may have cause for exultation in Christ’s day, + that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain. + 17 Notwithstanding, even if I am * being poured out like a drink offering * + upon the sacrifice + and public service to which faith has led YOU , + I am glad and I rejoice + with all of YOU . * 18 Now in the same way YOU yourselves also be glad and rejoice with me. * + 19 For my part I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to YOU shortly, that I may be a cheerful soul + when I get to know about the things pertaining to YOU . 20 For I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care + for the things pertaining to YOU . 21 For all the others are seeking their own interests, + not those of Christ Jesus. 22 But YOU know the proof he gave of himself, that like a child + with a father he slaved with me in furtherance of the good news. 23 This, therefore, is the man I am hoping to send just as soon as I have seen how things stand concerning me. 24 Indeed, I am confident * in [the] Lord that I myself shall also come shortly. + 25 However, I consider it necessary to send to YOU E·paph·ro·diʹtus, + my brother and fellow worker + and fellow soldier, + but YOUR envoy * and private servant for my need, 26 since he is longing to see all of YOU * and is depressed because YOU heard he had fallen sick. 27 Yes, indeed, he fell sick nearly to the point of death; but God had mercy + on him, in fact, not only on him, but also on me, that I should not get grief upon grief. 28 Therefore with the greater haste I am sending him, that on seeing him YOU may rejoice again and I may be the more free from grief. 29 Therefore give him the customary welcome + in [the] Lord with all joy; and keep holding men of that sort dear, + 30 because on account of the Lord’s * work he came quite near to death, exposing his soul * to danger, + that he might fully make up for YOUR not being here to render private service to me. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “not the (things) of selves each (ones).” ^ Lit., “This be you minding.” ^ Or, “thing to be seized.” Lit., “snatching.” ^ See App 5C . ^ Lit., “should confess out.” ^ Lit., “divided reckonings.” ^ “I congratulate all of you,” Vg. ^ “Drink offering.” Or, “libation.” ^ Or, “my life is;
