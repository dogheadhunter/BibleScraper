If any other man thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I the more so: + 5 circumcised the eighth day, + out of the family stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, + a Hebrew [born] from Hebrews; + as respects law, a Pharisee; + 6 as respects zeal, persecuting the congregation; + as respects righteousness that is by means of law, one who proved himself blameless. 7 Yet what things were gains to me, these I have considered loss on account of the Christ. + 8 Why, for that matter, I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. + On account of him I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse, + that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in union with him, having, not my own righteousness, which results from law, + but that which is through faith + in Christ, the righteousness that issues from God on the basis of faith, + 10 so as to know him and the power of his resurrection + and a sharing in his sufferings, + submitting myself to a death like his, + 11 [to see] if I may by any means attain to the earlier resurrection * + from the dead. 12 Not that I have already received it or am already made perfect, + but I am pursuing + to see if I may also lay hold + on that for which I have also been laid hold + on by Christ Jesus. * 13 Brothers, I do not yet consider myself as having laid hold on [it]; but there is one thing about it: Forgetting the things behind + and stretching forward to the things ahead, + 14 I am pursuing down toward the goal + for the prize * + of the upward call + of God by means of Christ Jesus. 15 Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, + be of this mental attitude; + and if YOU are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above [attitude] to YOU . 16 At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly + in this same routine. * 17 Unitedly become imitators + of me, brothers, and keep YOUR eye on those who are walking in a way that accords with the example YOU have in us. + 18 For there are many, I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping, who are walking as the enemies of the torture stake * of the Christ, + 19 and their finish * is destruction, + and their god is their belly, + and their glory consists in their shame, + and they have their minds upon things on the earth. + 20 As for us, our citizenship * + exists in the heavens, + from which place also we are eagerly waiting + for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, + 21 who will refashion our humiliated body * + to be conformed to his glorious body * + according to the operation + of the power that he has, even to subject + all things to himself.
