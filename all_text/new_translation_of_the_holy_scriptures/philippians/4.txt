The Lord * is near. + 6 Do not be anxious over anything, + but in everything by prayer and supplication + along with thanksgiving let YOUR petitions be made known to God; + 7 and the peace + of God that excels all thought will guard YOUR hearts + and YOUR mental powers by means of Christ Jesus. 8 Finally, brothers, whatever things * are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, + whatever things are lovable, * whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things. + 9 The things that YOU learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these; + and the God of peace + will be with you. 10 I do rejoice greatly in [the] Lord * that now at last YOU have revived YOUR thinking in my behalf, + to which YOU were really giving thought, but YOU lacked opportunity. 11 Not that I am speaking with regard to being in want, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be self-sufficient. * + 12 I know indeed how to be low [on provisions], + I know indeed how to have an abundance. In everything and in all circumstances I have learned the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to suffer want. + 13 For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me. + 14 Nevertheless, YOU acted well in becoming sharers + with me in my tribulation. + 15 In fact, YOU Phi·lipʹpi·ans, also know that at [the] start of declaring the good news, when I departed from Mac·e·doʹni·a, not a congregation took a share with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except YOU alone; + 16 because, even in Thes·sa·lo·niʹca, YOU sent something to me both once and a second time for my need. 17 Not that I am earnestly seeking the gift, + but that I am earnestly seeking the fruitage + that brings more credit to YOUR account. 18 However, I have all things in full and have an abundance. I am filled, now that I have received from E·paph·ro·diʹtus + the things from YOU , a sweet-smelling odor, + an acceptable sacrifice, + well-pleasing to God. * 19 In turn, my God + will fully supply all YOUR need + to the extent of his riches + in glory by means of Christ Jesus. 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. + Amen. 21 Give my greetings + to every holy one in union + with Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send YOU their greetings. 22 All the holy ones, but especially those of the household of Caesar, * send YOU their greetings. + 23 The undeserved kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with the spirit YOU [show]. * + Footnotes ^ “Lord,” א ABVg; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16,​24 , “Jehovah.” ^ “Lord,” א ABVg; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16,​24 , “Jehovah.” ^ “The Lord,” א ABVg; J 7,​8 , “Jehovah.” ^ Lit., “as many (things) as.” ^ Lit., “affection-inducing.” ^ “Lord,” א ABVg; J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16,​24 , “Jehovah.” ^ Or, “content.” ^ “God,” א ABVgSy p ; J 7,​8 , “Jehovah.” ^ Or, “the emperor.” ^ P 46 א ADItVgSy h,p Arm close with “Amen”; B omits.
