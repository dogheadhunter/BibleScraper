[Nothing,] except that in every way, whether in pretense + or in truth, Christ is being publicized, + and in this I rejoice. In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing, 19 for I know this will result in my salvation * through YOUR supplication + and a supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ, + 20 in harmony with my eager expectation + and hope + that I shall not be ashamed + in any respect, but that in all freeness of speech + Christ will, as always before, so now be magnified by means of my body, + whether through life or through death. + 21 For in my case to live is Christ, + and to die, + gain. 22 Now if it be to live on in the flesh, this is a fruitage of my work + —and yet which thing to select I do not make known. * 23 I am under pressure from these two things; + but what I do desire is the releasing * and the being with Christ, + for this, to be sure, is far better. + 24 However, for me to remain in the flesh is more necessary on YOUR account. + 25 So, being confident of this, I know I shall remain + and shall abide with all of YOU for YOUR advancement + and the joy that belongs to [ YOUR ] faith, 26 so that YOUR exultation may overflow in Christ Jesus by reason of me through my presence * again with YOU . 27 Only behave * in a manner worthy + of the good news about the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see YOU or be absent, I may hear about the things which concern YOU , that YOU are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul * + striving side by side for the faith of the good news, 28 and in no respect being frightened by YOUR opponents. + This very thing is a proof of destruction for them, but of salvation for YOU ; + and this [indication] is from God, 29 because to YOU the privilege was given in behalf of Christ, not only to put YOUR faith + in him, but also to suffer + in his behalf. 30 For YOU have the same struggle as YOU saw in my case + and as YOU now hear about in my case. + Footnotes ^ Or, “deacons.” Gr., di·a·koʹnois, dative, pl.; Lat., di·aʹco·nis . ^ “Overseers.” Gr., e·pi·skoʹpois, dative, pl.; J 17 (Heb.), hap· peqi·dhimʹ , “the overseers .” ^ Lit., “sense perception.” Gr., ai·stheʹsei; Lat., senʹsu . ^ Lit., “in accurate knowledge.” Gr., en e·pi·gnoʹsei; Lat., in sci·enʹti·a . ^ The bodyguard of the Roman emperor. ^ Or, “my being released.” ^ Or, “thing to choose I do not know.” ^ For a discussion of “the releasing,” see App 5D . ^ See App 5B . ^ Or, “carry on as citizens.” ^ Or, “as one man.” Previous Next Print Share Share
