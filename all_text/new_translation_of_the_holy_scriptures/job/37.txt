Or has any man said that it will be communicated? + 21 And now they do not really see the light; It is brilliant in the skies, When a wind * itself has passed by and proceeded to cleanse them. 22 Out of the north golden splendor * comes. Upon God * dignity + is fear-inspiring. 23 As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; + He is exalted in power, + And justice + and abundance of righteousness + he will not belittle. + 24 Therefore let men * fear him. + He does not regard any who are wise in [their own] heart.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “wings.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “is frozen.” ^ “Productive land of,” M(Heb., the·velʹ )T; Lat., orʹbis, “circle,” that is, of the earth. ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Symbolizing correction or chastisement. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ Or, “when there is a quieting of the earth.” ^ “When a wind .” Heb., we ruʹach .
