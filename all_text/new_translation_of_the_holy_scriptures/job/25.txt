And upon whom does his light not rise? 4 So how can mortal man * be in the right before God, * + Or how can one born of a woman be clean? + 5 Look! There is even the moon, and it is not bright; And the stars themselves have not proved clean in his eyes. 6 How much less so mortal man, who is a maggot, And a son of man, * who is a worm!” + Footnotes ^ “Mortal man.” Heb., ʼenohshʹ . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ .
