Only watch out for his soul * itself!” 7 So Satan went out away from the person * of Jehovah + and struck Job with a malignant boil + from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 8 And he proceeded to take for himself a fragment of earthenware with which to scrape himself; and he was sitting in among the ashes. + 9 Finally his wife said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? + Curse * God and die!” 10 But he said to her: “As one of the senseless + women speaks, you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from the [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” + In all this Job did not sin with his lips. + 11 And three companions of Job got to hear of all this calamity that had come upon him, and they proceeded to come, each one from his own place, Elʹi·phaz the Teʹman·ite + and Bilʹdad the Shuʹhite + and Zoʹphar the Naʹa·ma·thite. + So they met together by appointment + to come and sympathize with him and comfort him. + 12 When they raised their eyes from far off they did not then recognize him. And they proceeded to raise their voice and weep and rip + each one his sleeveless coat apart and toss dust toward the heavens upon their heads. + 13 And they kept sitting + with him on the earth seven days and seven nights, and there was no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that the pain + was very great.
