All this my eye has seen, My ear has heard and considers it. 2 What YOU men know I myself well know also; I am not inferior to YOU . * + 3 However, I, for my part, would speak to the Almighty himself, + And in arguing with God * I would find delight. 4 On the other hand, YOU men are smearers of falsehood; + All of YOU are physicians of no value. + 5 If only YOU would absolutely keep silent, That it might prove to be wisdom on YOUR part! + 6 Hear, please, my counterarguments, + And to the pleadings of my lips pay attention. 7 Will YOU men speak unrighteousness for God himself, And for him will YOU speak deceit? + 8 Will YOU be treating him with partiality, + Or for the [true] God will YOU contend at law? 9 Would it be good that he sound YOU out? + Or as one trifles with mortal man will YOU trifle with him? 10 He will positively reprove YOU + If in secrecy YOU try to show partiality; * + 11 Will not his very dignity make YOU start up with fright, And the very dread of him fall upon YOU ? + 12 Y OUR memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes; Y OUR shield bosses * are as shield bosses of clay. + 13 K EEP silent before me, that I myself may speak. Then let come upon me whatever it may be! 14 Why do I carry my flesh in my teeth And place my own soul * in my palm? + 15 Even if he would slay me, would I not wait? * + I would only argue to his face for my own ways. 16 He * would also be my salvation, + For before him no apostate will come in. + 17 H EAR my word clear through, + And let my declaration be in YOUR ears. 18 Look! Please, I have presented a case of justice; + I well know that I myself am in the right. 19 Who is the one that will contend with me? + For now were I to become silent I should simply expire! 20 Only two things do not do * to me; In that case I shall not conceal myself just on your account; + 21 Put your own hand far away from upon me, And the fright of you—may it not terrify me. + 22 Either call that I myself may answer; Or may I speak, and you return me answer. 23 In what way do I have errors and sins? Make me to know my own revolt and my own sin. 24 Why do you conceal your very face + And regard me as an enemy of yours? + 25 Will you make a mere leaf driven about quiver, Or keep chasing after mere dry stubble? 26 For you keep writing against me bitter things + And you make me possess [the consequences of] the errors of my youth. + 27 You also keep my feet put in the stocks, + And you watch all my paths; For the soles * of my feet you mark your own line. 28 And he * is like something rotten * that wears out; + Like a garment that a moth actually eats up. + Footnotes ^ See 12:3 ftn. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “Show partiality,” M; TSyVg, “treat him with partiality.” ^ Or, “your breastworks.” ^ “And . . . my own soul .” Heb., we naph·sh iʹ; Gr., psy·khenʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mam .
