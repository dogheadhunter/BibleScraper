Cause me to know why it is that you are contending with me. 3 Is it good for you that you should do wrong, + That you should reject [the product of] the hard work of your hands, * + And that upon the counsel of wicked ones you should actually beam? 4 Do you have eyes + of flesh, Or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? + 5 Are your days like the days of mortal man, + Or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man, 6 That you should try to find my error And for my sin you should keep looking? + 7 This in spite of your own knowledge that I am not in the wrong, + And there is no one delivering out of your own hand? + 8 Your own hands have shaped me so that they made me + In entirety round about, and yet you would swallow me up. 9 Remember, please, that out of clay + you have made me And to dust you will make me return. + 10 Did you not proceed to pour me out as milk itself And like cheese to curdle me? + 11 With skin and flesh you proceeded to clothe me And with bones and sinews to weave me together. + 12 Life and loving-kindness * you have worked with me; + And your own care + has guarded my spirit. * 13 And these things you have concealed in your heart. I well know that these things are with you. 14 If I have sinned + and you have kept watching me And of my error you do not hold me innocent; + 15 If I am actually in the wrong, too bad for me! + And [if] I am actually in the right, I may not raise my head, + Glutted with dishonor and saturated with affliction. + 16 And [if] it acts haughtily, + like a young lion you will hunt for me, + And you will again show yourself marvelous in my case. 17 You will bring forth new witnesses * of yours in front of me, And you will make your vexation with me greater; Hardship after hardship is with me. * 18 So why from a womb did you bring me out? + Could I have expired, * that not even an eye could see me, 19 There as though I had not come to be I should have become; From the belly to the burial place I should have been brought.’ 20 Are not my days few? + Let him leave off, Let him turn his gaze from me, that I may brighten up + a little 21 Before I go away—and I shall not come back + — To the land of darkness and deep shadow, * + 22 To the land of obscurity like gloom, of deep shadow And disorder, where it beams no more than gloom does.” Footnotes ^ “About myself,” MVg; LXX, “about him.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ Or, “palms.” ^ “My spirit ( breath ).” Heb., ru·ch iʹ; Gr., pneuʹma ; Lat., spiʹri·tum . ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “Witnesses,” MVg; LXX, “testing”; Sy, “weapons.” ^ Or, “one shift of compulsory labor after another is with me.” ^ Or, “Let me expire.” ^ Lit., “death shadow.” Previous Next Print Share Share
