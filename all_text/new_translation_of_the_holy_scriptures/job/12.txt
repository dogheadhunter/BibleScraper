I am not inferior to YOU , * + And with whom are there not things like these? 4 [One who is] a laughingstock to his fellowman I * become, + One calling to God * that he should answer him. + A laughingstock is the righteous, unblamable one. 5 In thought, the carefree one has contempt for extinction itself; + It is made ready for those of wobbling feet. + 6 The tents of the despoilers are unworried, + And the ones enraging God * have the safety Belonging to one who has brought a god * in his hand. + 7 However, ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; + Also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. + 8 Or show your concern to the earth, * and it will instruct you; + And the fishes of the sea + will declare it to you. 9 Who among all these does not well know That the hand of Jehovah * itself has done this, + 10 In whose hand is the soul + of everyone alive And the spirit * of all flesh of man? * + 11 Does not the ear itself test out words + As the palate + tastes food? 12 Is there not wisdom among the aged + And understanding [in] length of days? * 13 With him there are wisdom and mightiness; + He has counsel and understanding. + 14 Look! He tears down, that there may be no building up; + He makes it shut to man, that it may not be opened up. + 15 Look! He puts a restraint upon the waters and they dry up; + And he sends them, and they change the earth. + 16 With him there are strength and practical wisdom; + To him belong the one making a mistake and the one leading astray; + 17 He is making counselors go barefoot, * + And he makes judges themselves go crazy. 18 The bonds * of kings he actually loosens, + And he binds a belt upon their hips. 19 He is making priests walk barefoot, + And permanently seated ones he subverts; * + 20 He is removing speech * from the faithful ones, And the sensibleness of old men he takes away; 21 He is pouring out contempt upon nobles, + And the girdle of powerful ones he actually weakens; 22 He is uncovering deep things from the darkness, + And he brings forth to the light deep shadow; 23 Making the nations grow great, that he may destroy them; + Spreading out the nations, that he may lead them away; 24 Taking away the heart of the head ones of the people of the land, That he may make them wander about in an empty place, + where there is no way. 25 They grope in darkness, + where there is no light, That he may make them wander about like a drunken man. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “I am not falling behind you.” ^ “I,” MVg; LXXSy, “he.” ^ “To God.” Heb., le·ʼElohʹah . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “A god.” Heb., ʼelohʹah . ^ Or, “Or speak thoughtfully to the earth.” By a correction, “Or the reptiles [or, wild beasts] of the earth.” ^ “Jehovah,” MLXXSyVg; T(Aram.), Yai . ^ “And the spirit ( breath ) of.” Heb., we ruʹach ; Gr., pneuʹma ; Syr., we ru·ch aʼ; Lat., spiʹri·tus . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ Or, “and does not length of days mean understanding?” ^ “The One leading counselors captive,” LXX; Vg, “he leads counselors on to a foolish end.” ^ By a change of vowel pointing.
