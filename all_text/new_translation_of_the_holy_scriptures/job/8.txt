Will a reed grow big without water? 12 While it is yet in its bud, not plucked off, Even ahead of all other grass it will dry up. + 13 Thus are the pathways * of all those forgetting God, * + And the very hope of an apostate * will perish, + 14 Whose confidence is cut off, And whose trust is a spider’s house. * + 15 He will lean upon his house, but it will not keep standing; He will take hold of it, but it will not last. 16 He is full of sap before the sun, And in his garden his own twig goes forth. + 17 In a stone heap his roots become interwoven, A house of stones he beholds. 18 If one swallows him up from his place, + It will also certainly deny him, [saying,] ‘I have not seen you.’ + 19 Look! That is the dissolving of his way; + And from the dust others spring up. 20 Look! God * himself will not reject anyone blameless, Neither will he take hold of the hand of evildoers, 21 Until he fills your mouth with laughter, And your lips with joyful shouting. 22 The very ones hating you will be clothed with shame, + And the tent of wicked ones will not be.” Footnotes ^ “God.” Heb., ha·ʼElʹ .
