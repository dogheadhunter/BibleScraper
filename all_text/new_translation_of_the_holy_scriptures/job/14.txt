If it gets cut down, it will even sprout again, * + And its own twig will not cease to be. 8 If its root grows old in the earth And in the dust its stump dies, 9 At the scent of water it will sprout + And it will certainly produce a bough like a new plant. + 10 But an able-bodied man * dies and lies vanquished; And an earthling man * expires, and where is he? * + 11 Waters do disappear from a sea, And a river itself drains off and dries up. + 12 Man * also has to lie down and does not get up. + Until heaven is no more they will not wake up, + Nor will they be aroused from their sleep. * + 13 O that in Sheʹol * you would conceal me, + That you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, That you would set a time limit + for me and remember me! + 14 If an able-bodied man * dies can he live again? + All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, + Until my relief comes. + 15 You will call, and I myself shall answer you. + For the work of your hands you will have a yearning. 16 For now you keep counting my very steps; + You watch for nothing but my sin. + 17 Sealed up in a bag is my revolt, + And you apply glue over my error. 18 However, a mountain itself, falling, will fade away, And even a rock will be moved away from its place. 19 Water certainly rubs away even stones; Its outpouring washes off earth’s dust. So you have destroyed the very hope of mortal man. * 20 You overpower him forever so that he goes away; + You are disfiguring his face so that you send him away. 21 His sons get honored, but he does not know [it]; + And they become insignificant, but he does not consider them. 22 Only his own flesh while upon him will keep aching, And his own soul while within him will keep mourning.” * Footnotes ^ Or, “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “keep standing.” See Ex 9:16 ftn, “Existence.” ^ “Me,” M; LXXSyVg, “him.” ^ Or, “No one can.” ^ Or, “may cease,” as in vs 7. ^ Lit., “yet change.” ^ “But an able - bodied man .” Heb., we gheʹver . ^ “An earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Where is he?” MVg; LXXSy, “he is no more.” ^ Lit., “And man .” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ “He will not wake up, nor will he rouse himself from his sleep,” Vg and by a slight correction of M. ^ “In Sheol .” Heb., bi sh·ʼohlʹ ; Gr., haiʹdei ; Syr., ba· shiul ; Lat., in·ferʹno ; that is, the common grave of mankind.
