I have become of little account. + What shall I reply to you? My hand I have put over my mouth. + 5 Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; And twice, and I will add nothing.” 6 And Jehovah went on to answer Job out of the windstorm + and say: 7 “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man; + I shall question you, and you inform me. + 8 Really, will you invalidate my justice? Will you pronounce me wicked in order that you may be in the right? * + 9 Or do you have an arm like that of the [true] God, * + And with a voice like his can you make it thunder? + 10 Deck yourself, please, with superiority + and highness; + And with dignity + and splendor + may you clothe yourself. 11 Let flow the furious outbursts of your anger, + And see every one haughty and bring him low. 12 See every one haughty, humble him, + And tread down the wicked right where they are. 13 Hide them together in the dust, + Bind their very faces in the hidden place, 14 And I, even I, shall commend you, Because your right hand can save you. 15 Here, now, is Be·heʹmoth * that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats + just as a bull does. 16 Here, now, its power is in its hips, And its dynamic energy + in the tendons of its belly. 17 It bends down its tail like a cedar; The sinews of its thighs are interwoven. 18 Its bones are tubes of copper; Its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. 19 It is the beginning of the ways of God; * Its Maker + can bring near his sword. 20 For the mountains themselves bear their produce for it, + And all the wild beasts of the field themselves play there. * 21 Under the thorny lotus trees it lies down, In the concealed place of reeds + and the swampy place. + 22 The thorny lotus trees keep it blocked off with their shadow; The poplars of the torrent valley surround it. 23 If the river acts violently, it does not run in panic. It is confident, although the Jordan + should burst forth against its mouth. 24 Before its eyes can anyone take it? With snares can anyone bore [its] nose? * Footnotes ^ “Should there be any contending.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “Do you imagine that I have treated you otherwise than that you should appear righteous?” LXX. ^ “Like that of the [true] God.” Heb., ka·ʼElʹ .
