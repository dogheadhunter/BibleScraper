The dignity of its snorting is frightful. + 21 It paws * + in the low plain and exults in power; It goes forth to meet armor. + 22 It laughs at dread, and is not terrified; + Nor does it turn back on account of a sword. 23 Against it a quiver rattles, The blade of a spear and a javelin. 24 With pounding and excitement it swallows up the earth, And it does not believe that it is the sound of a horn. 25 As soon as the horn blows it says Aha! And from far off it smells the battle, The uproar of chiefs * and the war cry. + 26 Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, That it spreads its wings to the south wind? 27 Or is it at your order that an eagle + flies upward And that it builds its nest high up, + 28 That on a crag it resides and stays during the night Upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? 29 From there it has to search for food; + Far into the distance its eyes keep looking. 30 And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; And where the slain are, there it is.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “let loose their fetuses.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “A rustling mane,” M; T, “strength.” ^ “It paws,” LXXSyVg; M, “They paw.” ^ Lit., “princes.” Heb., sa·rimʹ .
