The fear of Jehovah * —that is wisdom, + And to turn away from bad is understanding.’” + Footnotes ^ “Some of mortal men .” Heb., me· ʼenohshʹ . ^ Lit., “The sons of pride (dignity).” ^ “Valuation,” MSyVg; LXX, “way.” ^ Or, “surging waters.” Heb., tehohmʹ, as in Ge 1:2 ; Gr., aʹbys·sos; Lat., a·bysʹsus . ^ “With gold .” Heb., be kheʹthem , an Egyptian loanword. ^ “Gold.” Heb., za·havʹ . ^ “Cush,” M(Heb., Kush )Sy; LXXVg, “Ethiopia.” ^ “Destruction.” Heb., ʼavad·dohnʹ .
