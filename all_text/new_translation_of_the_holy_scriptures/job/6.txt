That is why my own words have been wild talk. + 4 For the arrows of the Almighty * are with me, + The venom of which my spirit is drinking; + The terrors from God * range themselves up against me. * + 5 Will a zebra * + cry out over grass, Or a bull low over its fodder? 6 Will tasteless things be eaten without salt, Or is there any taste in the slimy juice of marshmallow? 7 My soul has refused to touch [anything]. They are like disease in my food. 8 O that my request would come And that God * would grant even my hope! 9 And that God would go ahead and crush me, That he would release his hand and cut me off! + 10 Even it would still be my comfort; And I should leap [for joy] + at [my] labor pains, [Though] he would have no compassion, for I have not hidden the sayings + of the Holy One. + 11 What is my power, that I should keep waiting? + And what is my end, that I should keep prolonging my soul? * 12 Is my power the power of stones? Or is my flesh of copper? 13 Is it that self-assistance is not in me, And effectual working itself has been chased away from me? 14 As regards anyone who withholds loving-kindness * from his own fellow, + He will also leave off even the fear of the Almighty. + 15 My own brothers have dealt treacherously, + like a winter torrent, Like the channel of winter torrents that keep passing away. 16 They are dark from ice, Upon them snow hides itself. 17 In due season they become waterless, + they have been silenced; When it grows hot they are dried up from their place. + 18 The paths of their way are turned aside; They go up into the empty place and perish. 19 The caravans of Teʹma + have looked, The traveling company of Sa·beʹans * + have waited for them. 20 They certainly are ashamed because they had trusted; They have come clear to the place and they get disappointed. + 21 For now YOU men have amounted to nothing; + Y OU see terror, and YOU become afraid. + 22 Is it because I have said, ‘G IVE me [something], Or from some of the power of YOU men make a present in my behalf; 23 And rescue me out of the hand of an adversary, + And out of the hand of tyrants YOU men should redeem me’? + 24 Instruct me, and I, for my part, shall be silent; + And what mistake I have committed make me understand. + 25 The sayings of uprightness have been—O not painful! + But what does reproving * on the part of YOU men reprove? + 26 Is it to reprove words that YOU men scheme, When the sayings of one in despair + are for mere wind? + 27 How much more will YOU cast lots even over someone fatherless, + And barter over YOUR companion! + 28 And now GO ahead, pay attention to me, [And see] whether I shall lie + to YOUR very faces. 29 Return, please—let no unrighteousness arise— Yes, return—my righteousness is yet in it. + 30 Is there unrighteousness on my tongue, Or does my own palate not discern adversity?
