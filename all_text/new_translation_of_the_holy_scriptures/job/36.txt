God * is mighty + and will not reject; [He is] mighty in power of heart; * 6 He will not preserve anyone wicked alive, + But the judgment of the afflicted ones he will give. + 7 He will not take away his eyes from anyone righteous; + Even kings on the throne + — He will also seat them forever, and they will be exalted. 8 And if they are bound in fetters, + They are captured with ropes of affliction. 9 Then he will tell them about the way they act And their transgressions, because they take a superior air. 10 And he will uncover their ear to exhortation, + And he will say that they should turn back from what is hurtful. + 11 If they obey and serve, They will finish their days in what is good And their years in pleasantness. + 12 But if they do not obey, they will pass away + even by a missile, + And they will expire without knowledge. 13 And those apostate in heart will themselves lay up anger. + They should not cry for help because he has bound them. 14 Their soul will die in youth itself, + And their life among male temple prostitutes. + 15 He will rescue the afflicted one in his affliction, And he will uncover their ear in the oppression. 16 And he will also certainly allure you from the mouth of distress! + Broader space, + not constraint, will be in its place, And the consolation of your table will be full of fatness. + 17 With the judicial sentence upon the wicked one + you will certainly be filled; Judicial sentence and justice will themselves take hold. 18 For [take care] that rage + does not allure you into [spiteful] handclapping, And let not a large ransom + itself lead you astray. 19 Will your cry for help take effect? + No, nor in distress Even all [your] powerful efforts. + 20 Do not pant for the night, * For peoples to retreat [from] where they are. 21 Be on your guard that you do not turn to what is hurtful, + For this you have chosen rather than affliction. + 22 Look! God * himself acts exaltedly with his power; Who is an instructor like him? 23 Who has called his way to account against him, + And who has said, ‘You have committed unrighteousness’? + 24 Remember that you should magnify his activity + Of which men have sung. + 25 All mankind * themselves have gazed upon it; Mortal man himself keeps looking from far off. + 26 Behold! God is more exalted than we can know; + In number his years are beyond searching. + 27 For he draws up the drops of water; + They filter as rain for his mist, 28 So that the clouds trickle, + They drip upon mankind abundantly. 29 Indeed, who can understand the cloud layers, The crashings from his booth? + 30 Look! He has spread out over it his light, + And the roots of the sea he has covered. 31 For by them he pleads the cause of peoples; + He gives food in abundance. + 32 In his hands he has covered over the lightning, * And he lays a command upon it against an assailant. + 33 His booming tells about him, + The livestock also concerning the one coming up.
