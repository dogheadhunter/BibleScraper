Y OU should understand, that afterward we may speak. 3 Why should we be reckoned as beasts + [And] be regarded as unclean in YOUR eyes? 4 He is tearing his soul to pieces in his anger. For your sake will the earth be abandoned, Or a rock move away from its place? 5 The light also of wicked ones will be extinguished + And the spark of his fire will not shine. 6 A light itself will certainly grow dark in his tent, + And in it his own lamp will be extinguished. 7 His steps of vigor * will become cramped. Even his counsel will cast him off. + 8 For he will indeed be let go into a net by his feet, And onto a network he will walk. + 9 A trap will seize [him] by the heel; + A snare + keeps hold upon him. 10 A cord for him is hidden on the earth, And a catching device for him on [his] pathway. 11 Round about, sudden terrors certainly make him start up in fright, + And indeed chase him at his feet. 12 His vigor becomes famished, And disaster + stands ready to make him limp. 13 It will eat the pieces of his skin; * The firstborn of death * will eat his limbs. 14 His confidence will be torn away from his own tent + And it will march him to the king of terrors. 15 There will reside in his tent something that is not his; Sulphur + will be strewed upon his own abiding place. 16 Underneath will his very roots dry up, + And, up above, his bough will wither. 17 The very mentioning of him will certainly perish from the earth, + And he will have no name out in the street. 18 They will push him out of the light into the darkness, And from the productive land * they will chase him away. 19 He will have no posterity and no progeny among his people, + And there will be no survivor in his place of alien residence. 20 At his day the people in the West will indeed stare in amazement, And a shudder will certainly seize even the people in the East. 21 Only these are the tabernacles of a wrongdoer, And this is the place of one that has not known God.” * Footnotes ^ Or, “uncanny power.” ^ “His skin will be eaten by disease,” by a slight correction of M. ^ “The firstborn of death,” that is, the most deadly disease. ^ “And from the productive land .” Heb., u·mit· te·velʹ ; Lat., et de orʹbe , “and from the [ terrestrial ] circle .” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl .
