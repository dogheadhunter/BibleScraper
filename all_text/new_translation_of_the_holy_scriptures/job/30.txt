In them vigor has perished. + 3 Because of want and hunger they are sterile, Gnawing at a waterless region, + [Where] yesterday there were storm and desolation. 4 They were plucking the salt herb by the bushes, And the root of broom trees was their food. 5 From the community they would be driven away; + People would shout at them as at a thief. 6 [They have] to reside on the very slope of torrent valleys, In holes of the dust and in rocks. 7 Among the bushes they would cry out; Under the nettles they would huddle together. 8 Sons of the senseless one, + also sons of the nameless one, They have been scourged out of the land. 9 And now I have become even the theme of their song, + And I am to them for a byword. + 10 They have detested me, they have kept themselves far from me; + And from my face they did not hold back [their] spit. + 11 For he loosened [my] own bowstring and proceeded to humble me, And the bridle they left loose on my account. 12 At [my] right hand they rise up as a brood; My feet they have let go, But they proceeded to cast up against me their disastrous barriers. + 13 They have torn down my roadways; They were beneficial only for adversity to me, + Without their having any helper. 14 As through a wide gap they proceed to come; Under a storm they have rolled along. 15 Sudden terrors have been turned upon me; My noble bearing is chased like the wind, * And like a cloud my salvation has passed away. 16 And now my soul is poured out within me; + Days of affliction + take hold upon me. 17 At night my very bones + have been bored through [and dropped] from off me, And [pains] gnawing me do not take any rest. + 18 By the abundance of power my garment takes on a change; Like the collar of my long garment it engirdles me. 19 He has brought me down to the clay, So that I show myself like dust and ashes. 20 I cry to you for help, but you do not answer me; + I have stood, that you might show yourself attentive to me. 21 You change yourself to become cruel to me; + With the full might of your hand you harbor animosity toward me. 22 You lift me to the wind, you cause me to ride [it]; Then you dissolve me with a crash. 23 For I well know that to death you will make me turn back, + And to the house of meeting for everyone living. 24 Only no one thrusts his hand out against a mere heap of ruins, + Nor during one’s decay is there a cry for help respecting those things. 25 Certainly I have wept for the one having a hard day; + My soul has grieved for the poor one. + 26 Although for good I waited, yet bad came; + And I kept awaiting the light, but gloom came. 27 My own intestines were made to boil and did not keep silent; Days of affliction confronted me. 28 Saddened + I walked about when there was no sunlight; * I got up in the congregation, * I kept crying for help. 29 A brother to jackals I became, And a companion to the daughters of the ostrich. + 30 My very skin became black + [and dropped] off me, And my very bones became hot from dryness. 31 And my harp came to be merely for mourning, And my pipe for the voice of weeping ones.
