Against Job his anger blazed over his declaring his own soul righteous rather than God. * + 3 Also, against his three companions his anger blazed over the fact that they had not found an answer but they proceeded to pronounce God * wicked. + 4 And E·liʹhu himself had waited for Job with words, because they were older than he was in days. + 5 And E·liʹhu gradually saw that there was no answer in the mouth + of the three men, and his anger kept getting hotter. 6 And E·liʹhu the son of Barʹa·chel the Buzʹite proceeded to answer and say: “Young I am in days And YOU men are aged. + That is why I drew back * and was afraid To declare my knowledge to YOU men. 7 I said, ‘Days themselves should speak, And a multitude of years are what should make wisdom known.’ + 8 Surely it is the spirit in mortal men And the breath of the Almighty [that] gives them understanding. + 9 It is not those merely abundant in days that prove wise, + Nor those just old that understand judgment. + 10 Therefore I said, ‘Do listen to me. I shall declare my knowledge, even I.’ 11 Look! I have waited for the words of YOU men, I kept giving ear to YOUR reasonings, + Until YOU could search for words [to say]. 12 And to YOU I kept my attention turned, And here there is no one reproving Job, None of YOU answering his sayings, 13 That YOU may not say, ‘We have found wisdom; + It is God * that drives him away, not a man.’ 14 As he has not arrayed words against me, So with the sayings of YOU men I shall not reply to him. 15 They have been terrified, they have answered no more; Words have moved away from them. 16 And I have waited, for they do not continue speaking; For they stood still, they answered no more. 17 I shall give in answer my part, even I; I shall declare my knowledge, even I; 18 For I have become full of words; Spirit has brought pressure + upon me in my belly. 19 Look! My belly is like wine that has no vent; Like new skin bottles it wants to burst open. + 20 Let me speak that it may be a relief to me. I shall open my lips that I may answer. + 21 Let me not, please, show partiality to a man; * + And on an earthling man * I shall not bestow a title; + 22 For I certainly do not know how I can bestow a title; Easily my Maker + would carry me away.
