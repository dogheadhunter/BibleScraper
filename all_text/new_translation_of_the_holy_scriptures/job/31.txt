And when he calls for an accounting, what can I answer him? + 15 Did not the One making me in the belly make him, + And did not just One proceed to prepare us in the womb? 16 If I used to hold back the lowly ones from [their] delight, + And the eyes of the widow I would cause to fail, + 17 And I used to eat my morsel by myself, While the fatherless boy did not eat from it + 18 (For from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And from the belly of my mother I kept leading her); 19 If I used to see anyone perishing from having no garment, + Or that the poor one had no covering; 20 If his loins did not bless me, + Nor from the shorn wool + of my young rams he would warm himself; 21 If I waved my hand to and fro against the fatherless boy, + When I would see [need of] my assistance in the gate, + 22 Let my own shoulder blade fall from its shoulder, And let my own arm be broken from its upper bone. 23 For disaster from God * was a dread to me, And against his dignity + I could not hold out. 24 If I have put gold * as my confidence, Or to gold * I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ + 25 If I used to rejoice because my property was much, + And because my hand had found a lot of things; + 26 If I used to see the light when it would flash forth, Or the precious moon walking along, + 27 And my heart began to be enticed in secrecy + And my hand proceeded to kiss my mouth, * 28 That too would be an error for [attention by] the justices, For I should have denied the [true] God above. 29 If I used to rejoice at the extinction of one intensely hating me, + Or I felt excited * because evil had found him— 30 And I did not allow my palate to sin By asking for an oath against his soul. + 31 If the men of my tent did not say, ‘Who can produce anyone that has not been satisfied from food * of his?’ + — 32 Outside no alien resident would spend the night; + My doors I kept open to the path. * 33 If like an earthling man * I covered over my transgressions + By hiding my error in my shirt pocket— 34 Because I would suffer a shock at a large crowd, Or the contempt itself of families would terrorize me And I would keep silent, I would not go out of the entrance. 35 O that I had someone listening to me, + That according to my signature * the Almighty himself would answer me! + Or that the individual * in the case at law with me had written a document itself! 36 Surely upon my shoulder I would carry it; I would bind it around me like a grand crown. 37 The number of my steps I would tell him; + Like a leader I would approach him. 38 If against me my own ground would cry for aid, And together its furrows themselves would weep; 39 If its fruitage * I have eaten without money, + And the soul of its owners I have caused to pant, + 40 Instead of wheat let the thorny weed go forth, + And instead of barley stinking weeds.” The words of Job have come to an end.
