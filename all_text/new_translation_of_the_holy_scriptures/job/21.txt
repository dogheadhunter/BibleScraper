Or why is it that my spirit does not get impatient? 5 Turn YOUR faces to me and stare in amazement, And put [ YOUR ] hand upon [ YOUR ] mouth. + 6 And if I have remembered, I have also become disturbed, And shuddering has taken hold of my flesh. 7 Why is it that the wicked themselves keep living, + Have grown old, also have become superior in wealth? + 8 Their offspring are firmly established with them in their sight, And their descendants before their eyes. 9 Their houses are peace itself, free from dread, + And the rod of God * is not upon them. 10 His own bull actually impregnates, and it does not waste semen; His cow brings forth + and suffers no abortion. 11 They keep sending out their young boys just like a flock, And their own male children go skipping about. 12 They continue raising [their voice] with the tambourine and harp, + And keep rejoicing at the sound of the pipe. 13 They spend their days in good times, + And in a moment down to Sheʹol they descend. 14 And they say to the [true] God, ‘Turn away from us! + And in the knowledge of your ways we have found no delight. + 15 What does the Almighty amount to, that we should serve him, * + And how do we benefit ourselves in that we have come in touch with him?’ + 16 Look! Their well-being is not in their own power. * + The very counsel of wicked ones has kept far from me. + 17 How many times is the lamp of the wicked ones extinguished, + And [how many times] does their disaster come upon them? [How many times] in his anger does he apportion destruction? + 18 Do they become like straw before a wind, * + And like chaff that a storm wind has stolen away? 19 God * himself will store up one’s hurtfulness for one’s own sons; + He will reward him that he may know [it]. + 20 His eyes will see his decay, And from the rage of the Almighty he will drink. + 21 For what will his delight be in his house after him, When the number of his months will really be cut in two? + 22 Will he teach knowledge even to God, * + When that One himself judges high ones? + 23 This very one will die during his full self-sufficiency, + When he is altogether carefree and at ease; 24 [When] his own thighs have become full of fat And the very marrow of his bones is being kept moist. 25 And this other one will die with a bitter soul When he has not eaten of good things. + 26 Together in the dust they will lie down + And maggots themselves will form a cover over them. + 27 Look! I well know the thoughts of YOU men And the schemes with which YOU would act violently against me. + 28 For YOU say, ‘Where is the house of the noble one, And where is the tent, the tabernacles of wicked ones?’ + 29 Have YOU not asked those traveling over the roads? And do YOU not carefully inspect their very signs, 30 That at the day of disaster an evil one is spared, + At the day of fury he is delivered? * 31 Who will tell him of his way to his very face? + And for what he himself has done who will reward him? + 32 As for him, to the graveyard he will be brought, + And over a tomb * a vigil will be kept. 33 To him the clods of earth of a torrent valley will certainly become sweet, + And after him he will drag all mankind, * + And those before him were without number. 34 So how vainly YOU men try to comfort me, + And YOUR very replies do remain as unfaithfulness!” Footnotes ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah .
