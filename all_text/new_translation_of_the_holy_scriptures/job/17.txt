So come on, please, As I do not find anyone wise among YOU . + 11 My own days have passed along, + my own plans have been torn apart, + The wishes of my heart. 12 Night they keep putting for day: + ‘Light is near on account of darkness.’ 13 If I keep waiting, Sheʹol is my house; + In the darkness + I shall have to spread out my lounge. 14 To the pit + I shall have to call out, ‘You are my father!’ To the maggot, + ‘My mother and my sister!’ 15 So where, then, is my hope? + And my hope—who is it that beholds it? 16 To the bars of Sheʹol * they * will go down, When we, all together, must descend to the very dust.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “breath.” See 12:10 ftn, “Spirit.” ^ “Sheol.” Heb., sheʼolʹ; Gr., haiʹden; Lat., in·ferʹnum .
