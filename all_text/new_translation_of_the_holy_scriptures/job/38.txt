And as for the Ash constellation * alongside its sons, can you conduct them? 33 Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, + Or could you put its authority in the earth? 34 Can you raise your voice even to the cloud, So that a heaving mass of water itself may cover you? + 35 Can you send forth lightnings that they may go And say to you, ‘Here we are!’? 36 Who put wisdom + in the cloud layers, * Or who gave understanding + to the sky phenomenon? * 37 Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, Or the water jars of heaven—who can tip [them] over, + 38 When the dust pours out as into a molten mass, And the clods of earth themselves get stuck together? 39 Can you hunt prey for a lion itself And can you satisfy * the lively appetite of young lions, + 40 When they crouch in the hiding places, + [Or] keep lying in the covert for an ambush? 41 Who prepares for the raven its food + When its own young ones cry to God * for help, [When] they keep wandering about because there is nothing to eat?
