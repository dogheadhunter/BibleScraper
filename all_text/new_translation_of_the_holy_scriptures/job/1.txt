The work of his hands you have blessed, + and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. 11 But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] whether he will not curse * you to your very face.” + 12 Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!” So Satan went out away from the person * of Jehovah. + 13 Now it came to be the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother the firstborn. + 14 And there came a messenger + to Job, and he proceeded to say: “The cattle themselves happened to be plowing + and the she-asses were grazing at the side of them 15 when the Sa·beʹans * + came making a raid and taking them, and the attendants they struck down with the edge of the sword; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.” + 16 While this one was yet speaking that one came and proceeded to say: “The very fire of God fell from the heavens + and went blazing among the sheep and the attendants and eating them up; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.” 17 While that one was yet speaking another one came and proceeded to say: “The Chal·deʹans + made up three bands and went dashing against the camels and taking them, and the attendants they struck down with the edge of the sword; and I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.” 18 While this other one was yet speaking, still another one came and proceeded to say: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine + in the house of their brother the firstborn. 19 And, look! there came a great wind * + from the region of the wilderness, and it went striking the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died. And I got to escape, only I by myself, to tell you.” 20 And Job proceeded to get up and rip + his sleeveless coat apart and cut the hair + off his head and fall to the earth + and bow down + 21 and say: “Naked I came out of my mother’s belly, + And naked shall I return there. + Jehovah himself has given, + and Jehovah himself has taken away. + Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.” + 22 In all this Job did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God. + Footnotes ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “Job.” Heb., ʼI·yohvʹ, meaning “Object of Hostility.” Not the same as weYohvʹ, “and Iob,” in Ge 46:13 . ^ Lit., “sons of the East.” ^ Or, “small cattle,” including sheep and goats. ^ “Each one.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “Have cursed” was the original reading.
