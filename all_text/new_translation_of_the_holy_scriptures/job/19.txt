I keep crying out, ‘Violence!’ but I get no answer; + I keep crying for help, but there is no justice. + 8 My very path he has blocked with a stone wall, + and I cannot pass over; And upon my roadways he puts darkness itself. + 9 My own glory he has stripped from me, + And he takes away the crown of my head. 10 He pulls me down on all sides, and I go away; And he pulls my hope out just like a tree. 11 His anger also grows hot against me, + And he keeps reckoning me as an adversary of his. 12 Unitedly his troops come and cast up their way against me, + And they camp round about my tent. 13 My own brothers he has put far away from me, + And the very ones knowing me have even turned aside from me. 14 My intimate acquaintances * have ceased to be, + And those known by me have themselves forgotten me, 15 Those residing as aliens in my house; + and my slave girls themselves reckon me as a stranger; A real foreigner I have become in their eyes. 16 To my servant I have called, but he does not answer. With my own mouth I keep imploring him for compassion. 17 My breath * itself has become loathsome to my wife, + And I have become foul-smelling to the sons of my [mother’s] belly. 18 Also young boys themselves have rejected me; + Let me but rise up, and they begin to speak against me. 19 All the men of my intimate group detest me, + And those whom I loved have turned against me. + 20 To my skin and to my flesh my bones actually cleave, + And I escape with the skin of my teeth. * 21 Show me some favor, show me some favor, O YOU my companions, + For God’s * own hand has touched me. + 22 Why do YOU men keep persecuting me as God * does, + And not become satisfied with my very flesh? 23 O that now my words were written down! O that in a book they were even inscribed! 24 With an iron stylus + and [with] lead, Forever in the rock O that they were hewn! 25 And I myself well know that my redeemer * + is alive, And that, coming after [me], he will rise up + over [the] dust. 26 And after my skin, [which] they have skinned off,—this! Yet reduced in my flesh * I shall behold God, * 27 Whom even I shall behold for myself, + And [whom] my very eyes will certainly see, but not some stranger. My kidneys have failed deep within me. 28 For YOU men say, ‘Why do we keep persecuting + him?’ When the very root of [the] matter is found in me. * 29 Be frightened for yourselves because of a sword, + For the sword means a raging against errors, In order that YOU men may know there is a judge.” * + Footnotes ^ LXX adds: “by saying a thing that was not necessary, and my sayings (utterances) are mistaken (err) and not seasonable (timely).” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah, sing. of ʼElo·himʹ . ^ Or, “My relations.” ^ “My breath ( spirit ).” Heb., ru·ch iʹ; Lat., haʹli·tum . ^ “And my flesh becomes hairless in my teeth,” by another derivation of the verb and some corrections of M. Compare 13:14 . ^ “God’s.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “My redeemer ( repurchaser ).” By extension of thought, “my avenger ( vindicator ).” Heb., goʹʼal i; Lat., re·demʹptor . See Nu 35:21; Ps 19:14; Pr 23:11; Isa 63:16; Jer 50:34 . ^ Lit., “Yet out of my flesh,” or, “Yet apart from my flesh.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ According to M; LXX, “we shall find in him.” ^ “There is a judge,” T and by a different vowel pointing of M (see 1Sa 24:15 ); others make it read, “there is an Almighty.” Previous Next Print Share Share
