But to put a restraint on words who is able? 3 Look! You have corrected many, + And the weak hands you used to strengthen. + 4 Anyone stumbling, your words * would raise up; + And knees giving way you would make firm. + 5 But this time it comes to you, and you become weary; It touches even you, and you get disturbed. 6 Is not your reverence [the basis of] your confidence? Is not your hope even the integrity + of your ways? 7 Remember, please: Who that is innocent has ever perished? And where have the upright + ever been effaced? 8 According to what I have seen, those devising what is hurtful And those sowing trouble will themselves reap it. + 9 Through the breath of God they perish, And through the spirit of his anger they come to an end. 10 There is the roaring of a lion, * and the voice of a young lion, But the teeth of maned young lions do get broken down. 11 A lion is perishing from there being no prey, And the cubs of a lion * are separated from one another. 12 Now to me a word was stealthily brought, And my ear proceeded to get a whisper of it, + 13 In disquieting thoughts from visions of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men. 14 A dread came over me, and a trembling, And the multitude of my bones it filled with dread. 15 And a spirit itself went passing over my face; The hair of my flesh began to bristle. 16 It began to stand still, But I did not recognize its appearance; A form was in front of my eyes; There was a calm, and I now heard a voice: 17 ‘Mortal man * —can he be more just than God * himself? Or can able-bodied man be cleaner than his own Maker?’ 18 Look! In his servants he has no faith, And his messengers * he charges with faultiness. 19 How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust! + One crushes them * more quickly than a moth. 20 From morning to evening they are crushed to pieces; Without anyone’s taking [it to heart] they perish forever. 21 Has not their tent cord within them been pulled out? They die for lack of wisdom. Footnotes ^ “Word.” Heb., dha·varʹ, used 20 times in Job. ^ “Your words .” Heb., mil·l eyʹkha, used 34 times in Job and only 4 times in other books. ^ Heb., ʼar·yehʹ .
