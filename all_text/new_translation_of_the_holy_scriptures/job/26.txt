O [how] you have saved an arm that is without strength! + 3 How much you have advised one that is without wisdom, + And you have made practical wisdom itself known to the multitude! 4 To whom have you told words, And whose breath * has come forth from you? 5 Those impotent in death * keep trembling Beneath the waters and those residing in them. + 6 Sheʹol is naked in front of him, + And [the place of] destruction * has no covering. 7 He is stretching out the north over the empty place, + Hanging the earth upon nothing; 8 Wrapping up the waters in his clouds, + So that the cloud mass is not split under them; 9 Enclosing the face of the throne, * Spreading out * over it his cloud. + 10 He has described a circle upon the face of the waters, + To where light ends in darkness. 11 The very pillars of heaven shake, And they are amazed because of his rebuke. 12 By his power he has stirred up the sea, + And by his understanding he has broken the stormer * + to pieces. + 13 By his wind * he has polished up heaven itself, + His hand has pierced the gliding serpent. + 14 Look! These are the fringes of his ways, + And what a whisper of a matter has been heard of him! But of his mighty thunder who can show an understanding?” + Footnotes ^ “And whose breath .” Heb., we nish·math -miʹ . ^ “Those impotent in death .” Heb., ho r·pha·ʼimʹ ; in earlier occurrences translated “the Rephaim”; LXXVg, “giants.” ^ “And [the place of] destruction .” Heb., la· ʼavad·dohnʹ , “Abaddon,” the first occurrence of this Heb. word; Gr., a·po·leiʹai ; Lat., per·di·ti·oʹni .
