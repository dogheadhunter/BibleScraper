Let not God * look for it from above, Nor let daylight beam upon it. 5 Let darkness and deep shadow * reclaim it. Let a rain cloud reside over it. Let the things that darken a day terrorize it. + 6 That night—let gloom take it; + Let it not feel glad among the days of a year; Among the number of the lunar months let it not enter. 7 Look! That night—let it become sterile; Let no joyful cry come in it. + 8 Let cursers * of the day execrate it, Those ready to awaken Le·viʹa·than. * + 9 Let the stars of its twilight grow dark; Let it wait for the light and there be none; And let it not see the beams of dawn. 10 For it did not close the doors of my [mother’s] belly, + And so conceal trouble from my eyes. 11 Why from the womb did I not proceed to die? + [Why did I not] come forth from the belly itself and then expire? 12 Why was it that knees confronted me, And why breasts + that I should take suck? 13 For by now I should have lain down that I might be undisturbed; + I should have slept then; I should be at rest + 14 With kings and counselors of the earth, + Those building desolate places * for themselves, + 15 Or with princes who have gold, Those who fill their houses with silver; 16 Or, like a hidden miscarriage, + I should not come to be, Like children that have seen no light. + 17 There the wicked themselves have ceased from agitation, + And there those weary in power are at rest. + 18 Together prisoners themselves are at ease; They actually do not hear the voice of one driving them to work. + 19 Small and great are there the same, + And the slave is set free from his master. * 20 Why does he give light to one having trouble, And life to those bitter of soul? + 21 Why are there those waiting for death, and it is not, + Although they keep digging for it more than for hidden treasures? 22 Those who are rejoicing to gleefulness, * They exult because they find a burial place. 23 [Why does he give light] to able-bodied man, * whose way has been concealed, + And whom God * hedges in? + 24 For before my food my sighing comes, + And like waters my roaring cries pour forth; + 25 Because a dreadful thing I have dreaded, and it comes upon me; And what I have been scared of comes to me. + 26 I have not been carefree, nor have I been undisturbed, Nor been at rest, and yet agitation comes.” Footnotes ^ “An able-bodied man.” Heb., ghaʹver . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah, sing. of ʼElo·himʹ . ʼElohʹah occurs 41 times in Job and 16 times in other books of M.
