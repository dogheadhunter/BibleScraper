You have said, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s.’ * + 3 For you say, ‘Of what use is it to you? + What benefit do I have more than by my sinning?’ + 4 I myself shall reply to you And to your companions * + with you. 5 Look up to heaven + and see, And behold the clouds, + [that] they are indeed higher than you. 6 If you actually sin, what do you accomplish against him? + And [if] your revolts actually increase, what do you do to him? 7 If you are really in the right, what do you give him, Or what does he receive from your own hand? + 8 Your wickedness may be against a man * like you, + And your righteousness to a son of earthling man. * + 9 Because of the multitude of oppressions they keep calling for aid; + They keep crying for help because of the arm of the great ones. + 10 And yet no one has said, ‘Where is God * my Grand Maker, * + The One giving melodies in the night?’ + 11 He is the One teaching + us more than the beasts * of the earth, + And he makes us wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens. 12 There they keep crying out, but he does not answer, + Because of the pride + of the bad ones. 13 Only the untruth God * does not hear, + And the Almighty himself does not behold it. + 14 How much less, then, when you say you do not behold him! + The legal case is before him, and so you should wait anxiously for him. + 15 And now because his anger has not called for an accounting, + He has also not taken note of the extreme rashness. + 16 And Job himself opens his mouth wide simply for nothing; Without knowledge he multiplies mere words.” + Footnotes ^ “More than God’s.” Heb., me·ʼElʹ; LXX, “Jehovah.” ^ “Companions,” M; LXX, “three friends.” ^ “Against a man .” Heb., le ʼishʹ . ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Grand Maker,” pl. in M, to denote excellence and grandeur, although “God” is sing. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ Or, “the domestic animals.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl .
