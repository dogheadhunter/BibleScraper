Will he call to God at all times? 11 I shall instruct YOU men by the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty I shall not hide. + 12 Look! Y OU yourselves have all of YOU seen visions; So why is it that YOU show yourselves utterly vain? + 13 This is the share of the wicked man * from God; + And the inheritance of the tyrants they will receive from the Almighty himself. 14 If his sons become many, it is for a sword; + And his descendants themselves will not have enough food. * 15 His own survivors will be buried during a deadly plague, * And their own widows will not weep. + 16 If he should pile up silver like dust itself, And he should prepare attire just as if clay, 17 He would prepare, but the righteous would be the one to clothe himself, + And in the silver the innocent would be the one to have a share. 18 He has built his house like a mere moth, And like a booth + that a watchman has made. 19 Rich he will lie down, but nothing will be gathered; * His eyes he has opened, but there will be nothing. + 20 Like waters * sudden terrors will overtake him; + At night a storm wind will certainly steal him away. 21 An east wind will carry him off + and he will go away, And it will whirl him away from his place. + 22 And it will hurl itself at him and have no compassion; + From its power he will without fail try to run away. + 23 One will clap his hands at him + And will whistle + at him from his place. * Footnotes ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “bread.” ^ Lit., “death.” ^ Or, “he will not be gathered,” M; LXXSy, “he will add nothing.” ^ “Like waters.” Or, “During the day,” by a correction. ^ Or, “[one passing] his place will whistle at it.” Previous Next Print Share Share
