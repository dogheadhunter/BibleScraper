My severe wound is incurable though there is no transgression.’ + 7 What able-bodied man * is like Job, + [Who] drinks up derision like water? + 8 And he is certainly on his way to companionship with practicers of what is hurtful And to walking with men of wickedness. + 9 For he has said, ‘An able-bodied man does not profit + By his taking pleasure in God.’ * 10 Therefore, YOU men of heart, + listen to me. Far be it from the [true] God * to act wickedly, + And the Almighty to act unjustly! + 11 For [according to] the way earthling man * acts he will reward + him, And according to the path of man * he will cause it to come upon him. 12 Yes, for a fact, God * himself does not act wickedly, + And the Almighty himself does not pervert judgment. + 13 Who has assigned to him the earth, And who has appointed [to him] the productive land, * even all of it? 14 If he sets his heart upon anyone, [If] that one’s spirit and breath he gathers to himself, + 15 All flesh will expire together, And earthling man * himself will return to the very dust. + 16 So if [you have] understanding, do listen to this; Do give ear to the sound of my words. 17 Really will anyone hating justice control, + And if a powerful one is righteous will you pronounce [him] wicked? + 18 Shall one say * to a king, ‘You are good for nothing’? * To nobles, ‘You are wicked’? + 19 [There is One] who has not shown partiality to princes And has not given more consideration to the noble + one than to the lowly one, For all of them are the work of his hands. + 20 In a moment they die, + even in the middle of the night; + The people shake back and forth and pass away, And powerful ones depart by no hand. + 21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, * + And all his steps he sees. 22 There is no darkness nor any deep shadow For those practicing what is hurtful to conceal themselves there. + 23 For he sets no appointed time for any man To go to God * in judgment. 24 He breaks powerful ones + without any investigation, And he makes others stand up instead of them. + 25 Therefore he recognizes what their works are, + And he does overthrow [them] at night, and they get crushed. + 26 As wicked ones he does slap them In the place of onlookers; + 27 For the reason that they have turned aside from following him, + And none of his ways have they considered, + 28 So as to cause the outcry of the lowly one to come to him; And so he hears the outcry of the afflicted ones. + 29 When he himself causes quietness, who, then, can condemn? And when he conceals [his] face, + who can behold him, Whether it is toward a nation + or toward a man, * it being the same thing? 30 So that an apostate man may not reign, + Nor there be snares + of the people. 31 For will anyone actually say to God himself, ‘I have borne, although I do not act corruptly; + 32 Although I behold nothing, instruct me yourself; If any unrighteousness I have committed, I shall not do [it] again’? + 33 Will he make good for it from your standpoint because you do refuse [judgment], Because you yourself choose, and not I? Even what you well know, speak. 34 Men of heart + themselves will say to me— Even a wise able-bodied man that is listening to me, 35 ‘Job himself speaks without knowledge, + And his words are without [his] having insight.’ 36 My father, let Job be tested * out to the limit Over his replies among men of hurtfulness. + 37 For on top of his sin he adds revolt; + Among us he claps [his hands] and multiplies his sayings against the [true] God!” * + Footnotes ^ “But God.” Heb., weʼElʹ . ^ “Able-bodied man.” Heb., gheʹver . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElo·himʹ; LXX, “Jehovah.” ^ “From the [true] God.” Heb., la·ʼElʹ; LXX, “Jehovah.” See App 1G . ^ “Earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl; LXX, “Jehovah.” ^ “Productive land.” Heb., te·velʹ; Lat., orʹbem, “circle,” that is, of the earth. ^ “And earthling man .” Heb., we ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “Shall there be a saying.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive construct, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ Lit., “king, ‘Belial!’?” ^ Or, “each one.” Heb., ʼish, as in vs 23. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “an earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “O that Job may be tested.” ^ “Against the [true] God.” Heb., la·ʼElʹ .
