I will speak in the distress of my spirit; * I will be concerned with the bitterness of my soul! + 12 Am I a sea or a sea monster, That you should set a guard + over me? 13 When I said, ‘My divan will comfort me, My bed will help carry my concern,’ 14 You even have terrified me with dreams, And by visions you make me start up in fright, 15 So that my soul chooses suffocation, Death + rather than my bones. 16 I have rejected [it]; + to time indefinite I would not live. Cease from me, for my days are an exhalation. + 17 What is mortal man + that you should rear him, * And that you should set your heart upon him, 18 And that you should pay attention to him every morning, That every moment you should test him? + 19 Why will you not turn your gaze from me, + Nor let me alone until I swallow my saliva? * 20 If I have sinned, what can I accomplish against you, the Observer of mankind? * + Why is it that you have set me as your target, so that I should become a burden to you? * 21 And why do you not pardon my transgression + And overlook my error? For now in dust + I shall lie down; And you will certainly look for me, and I shall not be.” Footnotes ^ “My spirit .” Heb., ru·ch iʹ; Lat., spiʹri·tus . ^ Or, “make much of him.” ^ That is, alone for the briefest time.
