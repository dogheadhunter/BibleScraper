But how can mortal man be in the right in a case with God? * + 3 If he should find delight in contending with him, + He cannot answer him once out of a thousand. 4 He is wise in heart and strong in power. + Who can show stubbornness to him and come off uninjured? + 5 He is moving mountains away, + so that people do not even know [of them], He who has overthrown them in his anger. + 6 He is making the earth go quaking from its place, So that its very pillars + shudder. 7 He is saying to the sun * that it should not shine forth, And around stars he puts a seal, + 8 Stretching out the heavens by himself + And treading upon the high waves * of the sea; + 9 Making the Ash constellation, * the Keʹsil constellation, * And the Kiʹmah constellation * + and the interior rooms of the South; * 10 Doing great things unsearchable, + And wonderful things without number. + 11 Look! He passes by me and I do not see [him], And he moves on and I do not discern him. + 12 Look! He snatches away. Who can resist him? Who will say to him, ‘What are you doing?’ + 13 God * himself will not turn back his anger; + Beneath him the helpers of a stormer * + must bow down. 14 How much more so in case I myself answer him! I will choose my words with him, + 15 Whom I would not answer, even though I were really in the right. + Of my opponent-at-law I would implore favor. + 16 If I called him, would he answer me? + I do not believe that he would give ear to my voice; 17 Who with a storm bruises me And certainly makes my wounds many for no reason. + 18 He will not grant me my taking * of a fresh breath, + For he keeps glutting me with bitter things. 19 If in power anyone is strong, there [he is]; * + And if in justice [anyone is strong], O that I may be summoned! 20 If I were in the right, my own mouth * would pronounce me wicked; Were I blameless, then he would declare me crooked. 21 Were I blameless, I would not know my soul; I would refuse my life. 22 One thing there is. That is why I do say, ‘One blameless, also a wicked one, he is bringing to their end.’ + 23 If a flash flood * itself should cause death suddenly, At the very despair of the innocent ones he would mock. 24 Earth itself has been given into the hand of the wicked one; + The face of its judges he covers. If not, who, then, is it? 25 Also my own days have become swifter than a runner; + They have run away, they will certainly not see good. 26 They have moved on like reed boats, Like an eagle that darts to and fro for something to eat. + 27 If I have said, ‘Let me forget my concern, + Let me alter my countenance + and brighten up,’ 28 I have been scared of all my pains; + I do know that you will not hold me innocent. 29 I myself am to become wicked. Why is it that I toil merely in vain? + 30 If I actually washed myself in snow water, And I actually cleansed my hands * in potash, + 31 Then in a pit you would dip me, And my garments would certainly detest me. 32 For he is not a man + like me [that] I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment. 33 There exists no * person to decide * between us, + That he should put his hand upon both of us. 34 Let him remove his rod from upon me, + And his frightfulness, let it not terrify me. 35 Let me speak and not be afraid of him, For I am not so disposed in myself.
