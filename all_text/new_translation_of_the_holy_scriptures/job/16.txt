All of YOU are troublesome comforters! + 3 Is there an end to windy words? + Or what galls * you, that you answer? 4 I myself also could well speak as YOU men do. If only YOUR souls existed where my soul is, Would I be brilliant in words * against YOU , + And would I wag my head against YOU ? + 5 I would strengthen YOU with the words of my mouth, + And the consolation of my own lips would hold back—. 6 If I do speak, my own pain is not held back, + And if I do cease doing so, what goes away from me? 7 Only now he has made me weary; + He has made all those assembling with me desolate. 8 You also seize me. It has become a witness, + So that my leanness rises up against me. In my face it testifies. 9 His very anger has torn [me] to pieces, and he harbors animosity + against me. He actually grinds his teeth against me. + My adversary himself sharpens his eyes against me. + 10 They have opened their mouth wide against me, + With reproach they have struck my cheeks, In large number they mass themselves against me. + 11 God * hands me over to young boys, * And into the hands of wicked ones he throws me headlong. + 12 I had come to be at ease, but he proceeded to shake me up; + And he grabbed me by the back of the neck and proceeded to smash me, And he sets me up as a target for himself. 13 His archers + encircle me; He splits open my kidneys + and feels no compassion; He pours out my gallbladder to the very earth. 14 He keeps breaking through me with breach after breach; He runs at me like a mighty one. + 15 Sackcloth + I have sewed together over my skin, And I have thrust my horn in the very dust. + 16 My face itself has become reddened from weeping, + And upon my eyelids there is deep shadow, * + 17 Although there is no violence upon my palms, And my prayer is pure. + 18 O earth, do not cover my blood! + And let there prove to be no place for my outcry! 19 Also now, look! in the heavens is one testifying about me, And my witness * is in the heights. + 20 My companions are spokesmen against me; + To God * my eye has looked sleeplessly. + 21 And the decision is to be made between an able-bodied man and God, The same as between a son of man * and his fellow. + 22 For just a few years * are to come, And by the path by which I shall not return I shall go away. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “pains [offends].” ^ “Let me join words,” according to another derivation of the verb. ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Lit., “a young boy,” M; LXXVg, “an unjust one.” ^ Lit., “death shadow.” ^ “And my witness .” Heb., we sa·hadh iʹ, considered an Aram. loanword.
