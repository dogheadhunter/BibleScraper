O no! Surely he himself would pay heed to me. + 7 There the upright one himself will certainly set matters straight with him, And I would go safe forever from my judge. * 8 Look! To the east I go, and he is not there; And back again, and I cannot discern him; + 9 To the left where he is working, but I cannot behold [him]; He turns aside * to the right, but I do not see [him]. 10 For he well knows the way I take. + [After] he has tested me out, I shall come forth as gold itself. + 11 Of his steps * my foot has laid hold; His way I have kept, and I do not deviate. + 12 [From] the commandment of his lips I do not move away. + I have treasured up the sayings of his mouth + more than what is prescribed for me. 13 And he is in one [mind], and who can resist him? + And his own soul has a desire, and he will do [it]. + 14 For he will carry out completely what is prescribed for me, + And things like these are many with him. 15 That is why I feel disturbed because of him; I show myself attentive and am in dread of him. + 16 Even God * himself has made my heart timid, + And the Almighty himself has disturbed me. + 17 For I have not been put to silence because of darkness, Nor because gloom has covered my own face.
