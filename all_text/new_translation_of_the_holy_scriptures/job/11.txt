What can you accomplish? It is deeper than Sheʹol. + What can you know? 9 It is longer than the earth in measure, And broader than the sea. 10 If he moves on and hands [someone] over And calls a court, then who can resist him? 11 For he himself well knows men * who are untrue. + When he sees what is hurtful, will he not also show himself attentive? 12 Even a hollow-minded man * himself will get good motive As soon as an asinine zebra be born a man. * 13 If you yourself will really prepare your heart And actually spread out your palms to him, + 14 If what is hurtful is in your hand, put it far away, And let no unrighteousness dwell in your tents. 15 For then you will raise your face without defect + And you will certainly become established, and you will not fear. 16 For you—you will forget trouble itself; As waters that have passed along you will remember [it]. 17 And brighter than midday will [your] life’s duration + arise; Darkness will become like the morning itself. + 18 And you will be bound to trust because there exists hope; And you will certainly look carefully around—in security you will lie down. + 19 And you will indeed stretch yourself out, with no one to make [you] tremble. And many people will certainly put you in a gentle mood; * + 20 And the very eyes of the wicked will fail; + And a place for flight will certainly perish from them, + And their hope will be an expiring of the soul.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “a man of lips.” ^ “Men.” Heb., methimʹ, adult males. ^ Lit., “doubled.” ^ Lit., “And know you,” imperative. ^ See vs 3 ftn. ^ “Even a . . . man .” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “an earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “soften your face.” Previous Next Print Share Share
