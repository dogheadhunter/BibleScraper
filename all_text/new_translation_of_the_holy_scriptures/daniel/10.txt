And there was left remaining in me no power, and my own dignity became changed upon me to ruination, and I retained no power. + 9 And I began hearing the sound of his words; and while I was hearing the sound of his words, I myself also happened to be fast asleep + upon my face, with my face to the earth. + 10 And, look! there was a hand that touched me, + and it gradually stirred me up to [get] upon my knees and the palms of my hands. 11 And he proceeded to say to me: “O Daniel, you very desirable man, * + have understanding in the words that I am speaking to you, + and stand up where you were standing, for now I have been sent to you.” And when he spoke with me this word, I did stand up, shivering. 12 And he went on to say to me: “Do not be afraid, + O Daniel, for from the first day that you gave your heart to understanding + and humbling yourself before your God * + your words have been heard, and I myself have come because of your words. + 13 But the prince * + of the royal realm of Persia + was standing in opposition + to me for twenty-one days, and, look! Miʹcha·el, * + one of the foremost * princes, + came to help me; and I, for my part, remained * there beside the kings of Persia. + 14 And I have come to cause you to discern what will befall your people + in the final part of the days, + because it is a vision + yet for the days [to come].” + 15 Now when he spoke with me words like these, I had set my face to the earth + and had become speechless. 16 And, look! one similar to the likeness of the sons of mankind * was touching my lips, + and I began to open my mouth and speak + and say to the one who was standing in front of me: “O my lord, * + because of the appearance my convulsions were turned within me, and I did not retain any power. + 17 So how was the servant of this my lord able to speak with this my lord? + And as for me, up to now there kept standing in me no power, and no breath at all was left remaining in me.” + 18 And the one like the appearance of an earthling man * proceeded to touch me again and strengthen me. + 19 Then he said: “Do not be afraid, + O very desirable man. * + May you have peace. + Be strong, yes, be strong.” + And as soon as he spoke with me I exerted my strength and finally said: “Let my lord speak, + because you have strengthened me.” + 20 So he went on to say: “Do you really know why I have come to you? And now I shall go back to fight with the prince * of Persia. + When I am going forth, look! also the prince of Greece * is coming. + 21 However, I shall tell you the things noted down in the writing of truth, + and there is no one holding strongly with me in these [things] but Miʹcha·el, * + the prince of YOU people. + Footnotes ^ “Of Cyrus.” Heb., leKhohʹresh; Gr., Kyʹrou; Lat., Cyʹri . ^ Lit., “and . . . truth .” Heb., we· ʼemethʹ . ^ Lit., “three weeks of days .” Heb., shelo·shahʹ sha·vu·ʽimʹ ya·mimʹ . ^ “Hiddekel.” Heb., Chid·daʹqel; LXXVg, “Tigris”; Sy, “Euphrates.” ^ Lit., “one man .” Heb., ʼish- ʼe·chadhʹ . ^ “With gold .” Heb., be kheʹthem , an Egyptian loanword. ^ “Uphaz.” Heb., ʼU·phazʹ; Lat., o·briʹzo, “refined.” ^ “But as for the men .” Heb., weha· ʼana·shimʹ , pl. of ʼish . ^ Lit., “ man of desirable things.” Heb., ʼish- chamu·dhohthʹ . ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹkha . ^ “Michael,” M(Heb., Mi·kha·ʼelʹ )LXXSyVg; meaning “Who Is Like God?” ^ “But the prince of.” Heb., we sarʹ ; LXX Bagster (Gr.), arʹkhon ; Lat., prinʹceps . ^ Or, “first.” ^ “I, for my part, remained,” MVg; LXX, “him I left.” ^ Or, “the sons of earthling men .” Heb., benehʹ ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “O my lord .” Heb., ʼadho·n iʹ; Lat., doʹmi·ne mi . ^ Or, “a man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ; Gr., an·throʹpou; Lat., hoʹmi·nis . ^ See vs 11 ftn. ^ “Prince of.” Heb., sar; LXX Bagster (Gr.), arʹkhon·tos; Lat., prinʹci·pem . ^ “Greece.” Heb., Ya·wanʹ, “Javan.” See 8:21 ftn. ^ See vs 13 ftn, “Michael.” Previous Next Print Share Share
