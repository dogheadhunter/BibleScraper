And he kept requesting of the principal court official that he might not pollute himself. + 9 Accordingly the [true] God gave Daniel over to loving-kindness * and to mercy before the principal court official. + 10 So the principal court official said to Daniel: “I am in fear of my lord * the king, who has appointed YOUR food and YOUR drink. + Why, then, should he see YOUR faces dejected-looking in comparison with the children who are of the same age as YOURS , and [why] should YOU have to make my head guilty to the king?” 11 But Daniel said to the guardian whom the principal court official + had appointed over Daniel, Han·a·niʹah, Mishʹa·el and Az·a·riʹah: 12 “Please, put your servants to the test for ten days, and let them give us some vegetables + that we may eat and water that we may drink; 13 and let our countenances and the countenance of the children who are eating the delicacies of the king appear before you, and according to what you see do with your servants.” 14 Finally he listened to them as regards this matter and put them to the test for ten days. 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared better and fatter in flesh than all the children who were eating the delicacies of the king. + 16 So the guardian kept on taking away their delicacies and their drinking wine and giving them vegetables. + 17 And as for these children, the four of them, to them the [true] God gave knowledge and insight in all writing and wisdom; + and Daniel himself had understanding in all sorts of visions and dreams. + 18 And at the end of the days that the king had said to bring them in, + the principal court official also proceeded to bring them in before Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar. 19 And the king began to speak with them, and out of them all no one was found like Daniel, Han·a·niʹah, Mishʹa·el and Az·a·riʹah; + and they continued to stand before the king. + 20 And as regards every matter of wisdom [and] understanding + that the king inquired about from them, he even got to find them ten times better than all the magic-practicing priests + [and] the conjurers + that were in all his royal realm. 21 And Daniel continued on until the first year of Cyrus * the king. + Footnotes ^ “Babylon,” LXXVg; MSy, “Babel.” ^ One of 134 scribal changes from YHWH to ʼAdho·naiʹ .
