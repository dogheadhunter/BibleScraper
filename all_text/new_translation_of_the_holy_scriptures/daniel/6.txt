The king was speaking up and saying to Daniel: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God * whom you are serving with constancy + been able to rescue you from the lions?” + 21 Immediately Daniel himself spoke even with the king: “O king, live on even to times indefinite. 22 My own God + sent his angel + and shut the mouth of the lions, + and they have not brought me to ruin, forasmuch as before him innocence itself was found in me; + and also before you, O king, no hurtful act have I done.” + 23 Then it was that the king himself became very glad, + and Daniel himself he commanded to be lifted up out of the pit. And Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, and there was no hurt at all found on him, because he had trusted in his God. + 24 And the king commanded, and they brought these able-bodied men who had accused * Daniel, + and into the lions’ pit they threw them, + their sons and their wives; + and they had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions had got the mastery over them, and all their bones they crushed. + 25 Then it was that Da·riʹus * the king himself wrote to all the peoples, the national groups and the tongues that are dwelling in all the earth: + “May YOUR peace grow very much! + 26 From before me there has been put through an order + that, in every dominion of my kingdom, people are to be quaking and fearing before the God of Daniel. + For he is the living God and One enduring to times indefinite, + and his kingdom + is one that will not be brought to ruin, + and his dominion * is forever. * + 27 He is rescuing and delivering + and performing signs and wonders in the heavens + and on the earth, + for he has rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.” 28 And as for this Daniel, he prospered in the kingdom of Da·riʹus * + and in the kingdom of Cyrus * the Persian. + Footnotes ^ “Spirit.” Aram., ruʹach; LXX Bagster (Gr.), pneuʹma; Lat., spiʹri·tus . ^ “His God .” Aram., ʼEla·h ehʹ; Lat., Deʹi suʹi . ^ “ God or man .” Aram., ʼelahʹ we· ʼenashʹ ; Lat., deʹo et hoʹmi·ne . ^ “His God .” Aram., ʼEla·h ehʹ . ^ See 2:25 ftn. ^ “Your God .” Aram., ʼEla·h akhʹ; LXX Bagster (Gr.), The·osʹ ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ Lit., “said.” ^ Or, “dancing girls”; or, “concubines.” ^ See vs 16 ftn, “God.” ^ Or, “slandered.” Lit., “had eaten the pieces [of flesh torn from the body] of.” ^ See 5:31 ftn, “Darius.” ^ Lit., “to the end.” ^ Or, “and his rulership ( sovereignty ).” Aram., we shol·ta·n ehʹ .
