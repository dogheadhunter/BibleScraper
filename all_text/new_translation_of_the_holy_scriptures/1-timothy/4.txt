On the other hand, be training yourself with godly devotion * as your aim. + 8 For bodily training * is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion * + is beneficial for all things, + as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come. + 9 Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is that statement. + 10 For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, + because we have rested our hope + on a living God, who is a Savior + of all sorts of men, + especially of faithful ones. + 11 Keep on giving these commands + and teaching them. + 12 Let no man ever look down on your youth. + On the contrary, become an example + to the faithful ones + in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness. + 13 While I am coming, continue applying yourself to public + reading, + to exhortation, to teaching. 14 Do not be neglecting the gift + in you that was given you through a prediction + and when the body of older men * laid their hands + upon you. 15 Ponder over these things; + be absorbed in them, that your advancement + may be manifest to all [persons]. 16 Pay constant attention to yourself + and to your teaching. + Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you. + Footnotes ^ Or, “misleading spirits.” ^ Or, “the spirit.” ^ Or, “it is held sacred; it is treated as holy.” Gr., ha·gi·aʹze·tai; Lat., sanc·ti·fi·caʹtur; J 22 (Heb.), mequd·dashʹ . ^ “Godly devotion,” א AVg; J 7,​8 , “fear of Jehovah.” ^ “Godly devotion,” א AVg; J 7,​8 , “fear of Jehovah.” ^ Lit., “training (as gymnast).” Gr., gy·mna·siʹa; Lat., ex·er·ci·taʹti·o, “exercise.” ^ Or, “body of elders.” Gr., pre·sby·te·riʹou; J 17,​18 (Heb.), haz· zeqe·nimʹ , “the elders .” See Nu 11:25 .
