Keep on teaching these things + and giving these exhortations. 3 If any man teaches other doctrine + and does not assent to healthful + words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor to the teaching that accords with godly devotion, * + 4 he is puffed up [with pride], + not understanding anything, + but being mentally + diseased over questionings and debates about words. + From these things spring envy, + strife, abusive + speeches, wicked suspicions, 5 violent disputes about trifles * on the part of men corrupted in mind + and despoiled of the truth, + thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain. + 6 To be sure, it is a means of great gain, + [this] godly devotion * + along with self-sufficiency. * + 7 For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. + 8 So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things. + 9 However, those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation + and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, + which plunge men into destruction and ruin. + 10 For the love + of money is a root + of all sorts of injurious things, * + and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains. + 11 However, you, O man of God, flee from these things. + But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, * faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper. + 12 Fight the fine fight of the faith, * + get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration + in front of many witnesses. 13 In the sight of God, who preserves all things alive, * and of Christ Jesus, * who as a witness + made the fine public declaration + before Pontius Pilate, + I give you orders + 14 that you observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation + of our Lord Jesus Christ. 15 This [manifestation] the happy and only Potentate + will show in its * own appointed times, + [he] the King + of those who rule as kings and Lord + of those who rule as lords, 16 the one alone having immortality, * + who dwells in unapproachable light, + whom not one of men has seen or can see. + To him be honor + and might everlasting. Amen. 17 Give orders to those who are rich + in the present system of things * not to be high-minded, * + and to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, + but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment; + 18 to work at good, + to be rich in fine works, + to be liberal, ready to share, + 19 safely treasuring up + for themselves a fine foundation + for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life. + 20 O Timothy, guard what is laid up in trust with you, + turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called “knowledge.” + 21 For making a show of such [knowledge] some have deviated from the faith. + May the undeserved kindness be with YOU people.
