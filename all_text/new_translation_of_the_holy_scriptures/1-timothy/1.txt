Nevertheless, I was shown mercy, + because I was ignorant + and acted with a lack of faith. 14 But the undeserved kindness of our Lord abounded exceedingly + along with faith and love that is in connection with Christ Jesus. + 15 Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is the saying + that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. + Of these I am foremost. + 16 Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy + was that by means of me as the foremost case Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long-suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith + on him for everlasting life. + 17 Now to the King of eternity, * + incorruptible, + invisible, + [the] only God, + be honor and glory forever and ever. + Amen. 18 This mandate + I commit to you, child, Timothy, in accord with the predictions + that led directly on to you, that by these you may go on waging the fine warfare; + 19 holding faith and a good conscience, + which some have thrust aside + and have experienced shipwreck concerning [their] faith. + 20 Hy·me·naeʹus + and Alexander + belong to these, and I have handed them over to Satan + that they may be taught by discipline * not to blaspheme. * + Footnotes ^ Or, “of God , Savior of us.” Gr., The·ouʹ So·teʹros he·monʹ; Lat., Deʹi Sal·va·toʹris noʹstri; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha· ʼElo·himʹ Moh·shi·ʽ eʹnu . ^ “To Timothy.” Gr., Ti·mo·theʹoi, meaning “One Who Honors God.” ^ Lit., “house-administration.” Gr., oi·ko·no·miʹan . ^ Lit., “end.” Gr., teʹlos . ^ Or, “the eternal King.” ^ “Be taught by discipline.” Or, “be chastised; be instructed.” ^ Or, “speak abusively.” Previous Next Print Share Share
