Then it can relieve those who are actually widows. + 17 Let the older men * who preside + in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, + especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching. + 18 For the scripture says: “You must not muzzle a bull when it threshes out the grain”; + also: “The workman is worthy of his wages.” + 19 Do not admit an accusation against an older man, * except only on the evidence of two or three witnesses. + 20 Reprove + before all onlookers persons who practice sin, + that the rest also may have fear. + 21 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus * + and the chosen angels to keep these things without prejudgment, doing nothing according to a biased leaning. + 22 Never lay your hands + hastily upon any man; + neither be a sharer in the sins of others; + preserve yourself chaste. + 23 Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine + for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness. 24 The sins of some men are publicly manifest, + leading directly to judgment, but as for other men [their sins] also become manifest later. + 25 In the same way also the fine works are publicly manifest + and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hid. + Footnotes ^ Or, “elder.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹroi, dative, sing. ^ “Godly devotion,” א A; J 7,​8 , “wisdom and fear of Jehovah.” ^ “A person without faith,” א AVgSy p ; J 13,​14,​18 , “a person who has disowned Jehovah.” ^ “Widows,” that is, bereaved relatives. ^ Or, “elders.” ^ Or, “elder.” Gr., pre·sby·teʹrou . ^ See App 6E .
