All the things here they will make known to YOU . 10 Ar·is·tarʹchus + my fellow captive sends YOU his greetings, and so does Mark + the cousin of Barʹna·bas, (concerning whom YOU received commands to welcome + him if ever he comes to YOU ,) 11 and Jesus who is called Justus, these being of those circumcised. * Only these are my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and these very ones have become a strengthening aid to me. 12 Epʹa·phras, + who is from among YOU , a slave of Christ Jesus, sends YOU his greetings, always exerting himself in YOUR behalf in [his] prayers, that YOU may finally stand complete + and with firm conviction in all the will of God. 13 I indeed bear him witness that he puts himself to great effort in behalf of YOU and of those at La·o·di·ceʹa + and of those at Hi·e·rapʹo·lis. 14 Luke + the beloved physician * sends YOU his greetings, and so does Deʹmas. + 15 Give my greetings to the brothers at La·o·di·ceʹa and to Nymʹpha and to the congregation at her house. + 16 And when this letter has been read among YOU , arrange that it also be read + in the congregation of the La·o·di·ceʹans and that YOU also read the one from La·o·di·ceʹa. 17 Also, tell Ar·chipʹpus: + “Keep watching the ministry which you accepted in [the] Lord, that you fulfill it.” 18 [Here is] my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand. + Continue bearing my [prison] bonds + in mind. The undeserved kindness be with YOU . Footnotes ^ Or, “with what is favorable.” ^ Lit., “out of circumcision.” ^ Lit., “healer.” Gr., i·a·trosʹ; Lat., meʹdi·cus .
