Of this [good news] I Paul became a minister. + 24 I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for YOU , + and I, in my turn, am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations + of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation. + 25 I became a minister + of this [congregation] in accordance with the stewardship + from God which was given me in YOUR interest to preach the word of God fully, 26 the sacred secret + that was hidden from the past systems of things * + and from the past generations. But now it has been made manifest + to his holy ones, 27 to whom God has been pleased to make known what are the glorious riches + of this sacred secret + among the nations. It is Christ + in union with YOU , the hope of [his] * glory. + 28 He is the one we are publicizing, + admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, + that we may present every man complete * + in union with Christ. 29 To this end I am indeed working hard, exerting myself + in accordance with the operation + of him and which is at work in me with power. + Footnotes ^ “Christ,” א AVgSy p ; B omits. ^ Or, “praying always.” ^ “You have,” א AVg; B omits. ^ Or, “servant.” Gr., di·aʹko·nos; Lat., mi·niʹster (from miʹnus, “less”); J 17,​18 (Heb.), mesha·rethʹ, “attendant.” ^ Lit., “in spirit.” ^ Lit., “petitioning.” ^ “Of Jehovah,” J 7,​8 ; א AB(Gr.), tou Ky·riʹou; Vg, “of God.” See App 1D . ^ “All [other],” as in Lu 11:41, 42 . ^ Lit., “he.” ^ See App 5C . ^ “No matter whether they are,” BD * Vg; P 46 א ACD c , “yes, through him, no matter whether they are.” ^ Or, “orders of things.” Gr., ai·oʹnon; Lat., saeʹcu·lis; J 17,​22 (Heb.), me· ʽoh·la·mimʹ , “from [the past] orders of things .” ^ Lit., “the.” ^ Or, “mature; perfect.” Gr., teʹlei·on .
