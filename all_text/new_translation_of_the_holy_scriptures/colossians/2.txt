+ 23 Those very things are, indeed, possessed of an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship * and [mock] humility, a severe treatment of the body; + but they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh. + Footnotes ^ “Of the God of Christ,” P 46 B; א * AVg, “of God the Father of (the) Christ (Jesus).” ^ Or, “cheat.” ^ “Overflowing in it,” BSy h,p Arm; א * AVg, “overflowing.” ^ Lit., “seduction.” ^ “Divine quality.” Lit., “godship.” Gr., the·oʹte·tos; Lat., di·vi·ni·taʹtis . ^ Lit., “the.” ^ Lit., “he.” ^ See App 5C . ^ Or, “covenant.” ^ Lit., “having wiped out.” ^ Or, “him.” Gr., au·toiʹ, dative, sing. ^ Lit., “he made show of.” ^ Or, “of sabbaths.” ^ Or, “substance.” Lit., “body.” Gr., soʹma; Lat., corʹpus . ^ Lit., “lowly-mindedness.” ^ “Form of worship.” Lat., re·li·gi·oʹne, “religion.” ^ Quoted from the initiation rites of pagan mysteries. ^ Lit., “self-willed form of worship.” Gr., e·the·lo·thre·skiʹai; Lat., su·per·sti·ti·oʹne, “superstition.” Previous Next Print Share Share
