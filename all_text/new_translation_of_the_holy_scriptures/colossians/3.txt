Even as Jehovah * freely forgave YOU , + so do YOU also. 14 But, besides all these things, [clothe yourselves with] love, + for it is a perfect bond + of union. * 15 Also, let the peace + of the Christ * control in YOUR hearts, + for YOU were, in fact, called to it in one * body. + And show yourselves thankful. 16 Let the word of the Christ * reside in YOU richly in all wisdom. + Keep on teaching + and admonishing one another with psalms, + praises to God, * spiritual songs + with graciousness, singing in YOUR hearts to Jehovah. * + 17 And whatever it is that YOU do in word or in work, + do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, + thanking + God the Father through him. 18 Y OU wives, be in subjection + to [your] husbands, as it is becoming in [the] Lord. 19 Y OU husbands, keep on loving [your] wives + and do not be bitterly angry with them. + 20 Y OU children, be obedient + to [your] parents in everything, for this is well-pleasing in [the] Lord. 21 Y OU fathers, do not be exasperating your children, + so that they do not become downhearted. 22 Y OU slaves, be obedient in everything to those who are [your] masters in a fleshly sense, + not with acts of eye-service, as men pleasers, + but with sincerity of heart, with fear of Jehovah. * + 23 Whatever YOU are doing, work at it whole-souled + as to Jehovah, * + and not to men, 24 for YOU know that it is from Jehovah * + YOU will receive the due reward of the inheritance. + S LAVE for the Master, Christ. + 25 Certainly the one that is doing wrong will receive back + what he wrongly did, and there is no partiality. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “passion.” Gr., paʹthos . ^ Or, “filthiness; depravity; lewdness.” Gr., a·ka·thar·siʹan; J 17,​22 (Heb.), wehat· tum·ʼahʹ , “and the uncleanness .” See 2Co 12:21 ftn, “Uncleanness.” ^ “Fornication.” Gr., por·neiʹan; Lat., for·ni·ca·ti·oʹnem; J 17,​22 (Heb.), haz· zenuthʹ , “the fornication .” See App 5A . ^ Or, “blasphemy.” ^ Lit., “the old man.” ^ Or, “in.” ^ Or, “humility.” ^ “Jehovah,” J 23 ; P 46 ABD * (Gr.), ho Kyʹri·os; א c CD c Sy h,p , “the Christ”; א * , “God.” See App 1D . ^ Lit., “joint bond of the perfection.” ^ “Of the Christ,” א * ABC * D * ; א c C c D c , “of God”; J 7,​8 , “of Jehovah.” ^ “One,” א ADVgSy p ; P 46 B, “the.” ^ “To Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​13,​14,​16,​17 ; C c D c (Gr.), toi Ky·riʹoi; P 46 א ABC * D * VgSy h,p , “to God.” See App 1D . ^ Lit., “hymns.” Gr., hyʹmnois; Lat., hyʹmnis . ^ “The Christ,” P 46 א c BC c DVg; א * , “the Lord”; AC * , “God.” ^ “Of Jehovah,” J 18,​22 ; א * ABCD * (Gr.), ton Kyʹri·on; P 46 א c D c , “of God.” See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D .
