I shall make melody + to Jehovah, Israel’s God. + 4 Jehovah, at your going forth from Seʹir, + At your marching out of the field of Eʹdom, + Earth rocked, + heavens also dripped, + Clouds also dripped with water. 5 Mountains flowed * away from the face of Jehovah, + This Siʹnai + away from the face of Jehovah, + Israel’s God. + 6 In the days of Shamʹgar + the son of Aʹnath, In the days of Jaʹel, + pathways had no traffic, * And the travelers of roadways would travel by roundabout pathways. + 7 The dwellers in open country ceased, in Israel they ceased, + Until I, Debʹo·rah, + rose up, Until I rose up as a mother in Israel. + 8 They proceeded to choose new gods. + It was then there was war * in the gates. * + A shield could not be seen, nor a lance, Among forty thousand in Israel. + 9 My heart is for the commanders of Israel, + Who were volunteers among the people. + B LESS Jehovah. + 10 Y OU riders on yellowish-red she-asses, + Y OU who sit on rich carpets, * And YOU who walk on the road, Consider! + 11 Some of the voices of the water distributors among the places of drawing water, + There they began to recount the righteous acts of Jehovah, + The righteous acts of his dwellers in open country in Israel. It was then Jehovah’s people made their way down to the gates. 12 Awake, awake, O Debʹo·rah; + Awake, awake, utter a song! + Rise up, Baʹrak, + and lead your captives * away, you son of A·binʹo·am! + 13 It was then the survivors came down to the majestic ones; Jehovah’s people came down to me against the mighty ones. 14 Out of Eʹphra·im was their origin in the low plain, * + With * you, O Benjamin, among your peoples. Out of Maʹchir + the commanders went down, And out of Zebʹu·lun those handling the equipment of a scribe. + 15 And the princes in Isʹsa·char + were with Debʹo·rah, And as Isʹsa·char, so was Baʹrak. + Into the low plain he was sent on foot. + Among the divisions of Reuʹben great were the searchings * of the heart. + 16 Why did you sit down between the two saddlebags, To listen to the pipings for the flocks? + For the divisions of Reuʹben there were great searchings of the heart. + 17 Gilʹe·ad kept to his residence on the other side of the Jordan; + And Dan, why did he continue to dwell for the time in ships? + Ashʹer sat idle at the seashore, And by his landing places he kept residing. + 18 Zebʹu·lun was a people that scorned their souls to the point of death; + Naphʹta·li + also, on the heights of the field. + 19 Kings came, they fought; It was then that the kings of Caʹnaan fought + In Taʹa·nach + by the waters of Me·gidʹdo. + No gain of silver did they take. + 20 From heaven did the stars fight, + From their orbits they fought against Sisʹe·ra. 21 The torrent of Kiʹshon washed them away, + The torrent of ancient days, * the torrent of Kiʹshon. + You went treading down strength, + O my soul. 22 It was then that the hoofs of horses pawed + Because of dashings upon dashings of his stallions. 23 ‘C URSE + Meʹroz,’ said the angel of Jehovah, + ‘C URSE its inhabitants incessantly, For they did not come to the assistance of Jehovah, To the assistance of Jehovah with the mighty ones.’ 24 Jaʹel + the wife of Heʹber the Kenʹite + will be most blessed among women, Among women in the tent she will be most blessed. + 25 Water he asked, milk she gave; In the large banquet bowl of majestic ones she presented curdled milk. + 26 Her hand to the tent pin she then thrust out, And her right hand to the mallet of hard workers. + And she hammered Sisʹe·ra, she pierced his head through, + And she broke apart and cut up his temples. 27 Between her feet he collapsed, he fell, he lay down; Between her feet he collapsed, he fell; Where he collapsed, there he fell overcome. + 28 From the window a woman looked out and kept watching for him, * The mother of Sisʹe·ra from the lattice, + ‘Why has his war chariot delayed in coming? + Why must the hoofbeats of his chariots be so late?’ + 29 The wise ones of her noble ladies * + would answer her, Yes, she too would talk back to herself with her own sayings, 30 ‘Ought they not to find, ought they not to distribute spoil, + A womb—two wombs * to every able-bodied man, + Spoil of dyed stuffs for Sisʹe·ra, spoil of dyed stuffs, An embroidered garment, dyed stuff, two embroidered garments For the necks of [men of] spoil?’ * 31 Thus let all your enemies perish, + O Jehovah, And let your * lovers + be as when the sun goes forth in its mightiness.” + And the land had no further disturbance for forty years. + Footnotes ^ “Flowed,” MVg; TSy, “quaked”; LXX, “were shaken.” ^ Lit., “pathways ceased [suffered neglect].” ^ The meaning in M is obscure. ^ “Then the cities of the governors (princes) fought,” LXX B . ^ The meaning in M is obscure; LXX B Vg, “sit in judgment.” ^ Or, “captivity,” that is, a body of captives. ^ Or, “after.” ^ “In the low plain,” LXX A Th; MLXX B Vg, “in Amalek.” ^ “Searchings,” as in vs 16; M, “prescriptions.” ^ “Torrent of ancient days.” Or, “torrent of attack.” Heb., naʹchal qedhu·mimʹ; qedhu·mimʹ is of uncertain meaning; LXX B , “ancient winter-torrent”; Vg, “torrent Cadumim.” ^ “Kept watching [for him],” T; M, “kept lamenting.” ^ Or, “her princesses .” Heb., sa·roh·th eyʹha . ^ Soldiers’ expression for captured concubines. ^ “For the neck of a king’s wife,” by a change of one Heb. letter; by a slight change of vowel pointing, “for my neck as spoil”; by a change of a final Heb. letter, “for his neck as spoil.” ^ “Your,” SyVg; MLXX, “his.” Previous Next Print Share Share
