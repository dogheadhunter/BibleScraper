When he went out to battle, then Jehovah gave Cuʹshan-rish·a·thaʹim the king of Syria * into his hand so that his hand overpowered + Cuʹshan-rish·a·thaʹim. 11 After that the land had no disturbance for forty years. Eventually Othʹni·el the son of Keʹnaz died. 12 And once again the sons of Israel went doing what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. + At that Jehovah let Egʹlon the king of Moʹab + grow strong against Israel, + because they did what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes. + 13 Furthermore, he gathered against them the sons of Amʹmon + and Amʹa·lek. + Then they went and struck Israel and took possession of the city + of palm trees. 14 And the sons of Israel continued to serve Egʹlon the king of Moʹab eighteen years. + 15 And the sons of Israel began to call to Jehovah for aid. + So Jehovah raised up for them a savior, Eʹhud + the son of Geʹra, a Benʹja·mite, + a left-handed man. * + In time the sons of Israel sent tribute * by his hand to Egʹlon the king of Moʹab. 16 Meanwhile Eʹhud made a sword for himself, and it had two edges, + its length being a cubit. * Then he girded it underneath his garment upon his right thigh. + 17 And he proceeded to present the tribute to Egʹlon the king of Moʹab. + Now Egʹlon was a very fat man. 18 And it came about that when he had finished presenting the tribute, + he at once sent the people away, the bearers of the tribute. 19 And he himself turned back at the quarries * that were at Gilʹgal, + and he proceeded to say: “I have a secret word for you, O king.” So he said: “Keep silence!” With that all those who were standing by him went on out from him. + 20 And Eʹhud came to him as he was sitting in his cool roof chamber that he had to himself. And Eʹhud went on to say: “A word of God I have for you.” At that he rose up from his throne. 21 Then Eʹhud thrust in his left hand and took the sword off his right thigh and plunged it into his belly. 22 And the handle kept going in also after the blade so that the fat closed in over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly, and the fecal matter began to come out. * 23 And Eʹhud proceeded to go out through the air hole, * but he closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them. 24 And he himself went out. + And his servants came and began looking, and there the doors of the roof chamber were locked. So they said: “He is just easing nature * + in the cool interior room.” 25 And they kept waiting until they were ashamed, and, look! there was no one opening the doors of the roof chamber. At this they took the key and opened them, and, look! their lord * was fallen to the earth dead! 26 As for Eʹhud, he escaped while they were lingering, and he himself passed by the quarries + and made his escape to Se·iʹrah. 27 And it came about that when he got there he began blowing the horn * + in the mountainous region of Eʹphra·im; + and the sons of Israel began going down with him out of the mountainous region, he being at their head. 28 Then he said to them: “Follow me, + because Jehovah has given YOUR enemies, the Moʹab·ites, into YOUR hand.” + And they went following him and got to capture the fords + of the Jordan against the Moʹab·ites, and they did not allow anybody to pass over. 29 And at that time they went striking down Moʹab, about ten thousand men, + every one robust * + and every one a valiant man; and not a single one escaped. + 30 And Moʹab came to be subdued on that day under Israel’s hand; and the land had no further disturbance for eighty years. + 31 And after him there proved to be Shamʹgar + the son of Aʹnath, and he went striking down the Phi·lisʹtines, + six hundred men, with a cattle goad; and he too got to save Israel. + Footnotes ^ “Satrapies,” Gr., sa·tra·peiʹas; Lat., saʹtra·pas, “satraps.” See Jos 13:3 ftn, “Lords.” ^ See Jos 13:5 ftn, “Hamath.” ^ Or, “the Asherim.” ^ “Mesopotamia,” Vg; M, “Aram-naharaim”; LXX, “Syria of [the] rivers.” ^ “Syria [of rivers],” LXX A Vg; M, “Aram.” ^ Or, “gift.” ^ Lit., “a man closed (impeded) of his right hand,” M; LXX, “ambidextrous.” Compare 20:16 . ^ “A span,” LXX; Vg, “a palm of the hand”; Heb., goʹmedh, an uncertain linear measure.
