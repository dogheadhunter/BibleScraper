As Jehovah lives, if YOU had preserved them alive, I would not have to kill YOU .” + 20 Then he said to Jeʹther his firstborn: “Get up, kill them.” And the young man did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was yet a young man. + 21 So Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna said: “Get up yourself and assault us, for as a man is, so is his mightiness.” + Accordingly Gidʹe·on got up and killed + Zeʹbah and Zal·munʹna and took the moon-shaped ornaments that were on the necks of their camels. 22 Later the men of Israel said to Gidʹe·on: “Rule over us, + you and your son and your grandson as well, for you have saved us out of the hand of Midʹi·an.” + 23 But Gidʹe·on said to them: “I myself shall not rule over YOU , nor will my son rule over YOU . + Jehovah is the one who will rule over YOU .” + 24 And Gidʹe·on went on to say to them: “Let me make a request of YOU : Give me, each one of YOU , the nose ring + of his booty.” (For they had nose rings of gold, because they were Ishʹma·el·ites.) + 25 Then they said: “We shall surely give them.” With that they spread out a mantle and went throwing each one the nose ring of his booty into it. 26 And the weight of the nose rings of gold that he had requested amounted to one thousand seven hundred gold shekels, * besides the moon-shaped ornaments + and the eardrops and the garments of wool dyed reddish purple + that were upon the kings of Midʹi·an and besides the necklaces that were on the necks of the camels. + 27 And Gidʹe·on proceeded to make it into an ephʹod + and to exhibit it in his city Ophʹrah; + and all Israel began to have immoral intercourse with it * there, + so that it served as a snare to Gidʹe·on and to his household. + 28 Thus Midʹi·an + was subdued before the sons of Israel, and they did not lift up their head anymore; and the land had no further disturbance for forty years in the days of Gidʹe·on. + 29 And Jer·ub·baʹal + the son of Joʹash went his way and continued to dwell in his house. 30 And Gidʹe·on came to have seventy sons + that issued out of his upper thigh, for he came to have many wives. 31 As for the concubine of his that was in Sheʹchem, she too bore him a son. So he named him A·bimʹe·lech. + 32 Eventually Gidʹe·on the son of Joʹash died at a good old age and was buried in the burial place of Joʹash his father in Ophʹrah of the Abi-ezʹrites. + 33 And it came about that as soon as Gidʹe·on had died the sons of Israel again took up having * immoral intercourse with the Baʹals, + so that they appointed Baʹal-beʹrith as their god. * + 34 And the sons of Israel did not remember Jehovah their God, + who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies round about; + 35 and they did not exercise loving-kindness * + toward the household of Jer·ub·baʹal, Gidʹe·on, in return for all the goodness that he had exercised toward Israel. + Footnotes ^ “God,” MSy; TLXXVg, “Jehovah.” ^ That is, something prodding; possibly, threshing sledges. ^ Or, “by the ascent of Heres.” ^ “Shekels,” LXX A Vg; MLXX B Sy omit.
