They quickly turned aside from the way in which their forefathers had walked by obeying the commandments of Jehovah. + They did not do like that. 18 And when Jehovah did raise up judges + for them, Jehovah proved to be with the judge, and he saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah would feel regret + over their groaning because of their oppressors + and those who were shoving them around. 19 And it occurred that when the judge died they would turn around and act more ruinously than their fathers by walking after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. + They did not refrain from their practices and their stubborn behavior. + 20 Finally Jehovah’s anger blazed + against Israel and he said: “For the reason that this nation have overstepped my covenant + that I commanded their forefathers and have not listened to my voice, + 21 I too, for my part, shall not drive out again from before them a single one of the nations that Joshua left behind when he died, + 22 in order by them to test + Israel, whether they will be keepers of Jehovah’s way by walking in it just as their fathers kept it, or not.” 23 Accordingly Jehovah let these nations stay by not driving them out quickly, + and he did not give them into Joshua’s hand.
