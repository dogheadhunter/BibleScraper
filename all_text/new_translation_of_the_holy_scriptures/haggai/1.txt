There is a putting on of clothes, but it is not with anyone’s getting warm; and he that is hiring himself out is hiring himself out for a bag having holes.’” + 7 “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Set YOUR heart upon YOUR ways.’ + 8 “‘Go up to the mountain, * and YOU must bring in lumber. + And build the house, + that I may take pleasure in it + and I may be glorified,’ + Jehovah has said.” 9 “‘There was a looking for much, but here there was just a little; + and YOU have brought [it] into the house, and I blew upon it + —for what reason?’ + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies. ‘By reason of my house that is waste, while YOU are on the run, each one in behalf of his own house. + 10 Therefore over YOU [the] heavens kept back [their] dew, and the earth itself kept back its yield. + 11 And I kept calling for dryness upon the earth, * and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, + and upon the oil, and upon what the ground would bring forth, and upon earthling man, * and upon domestic animal, and upon all the toil of [the] hands.’” + 12 And Ze·rubʹba·bel + the son of She·alʹti·el, and Joshua the son of Je·hozʹa·dak + the high priest, * and all the remaining ones of the people began to listen to the voice of Jehovah their God, * + and to the words of Hagʹgai + the prophet, as Jehovah their God had sent him; and the people began to fear because of Jehovah. + 13 And Hagʹgai the messenger * + of Jehovah went on to say to the people according to the messenger’s commission from Jehovah, + saying: “‘I am with YOU people,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah.” 14 And Jehovah proceeded to rouse up the spirit + of Ze·rubʹba·bel the son of She·alʹti·el, the governor of Judah, and the spirit * of Joshua + the son of Je·hozʹa·dak the high priest, and the spirit of all the remaining ones of the people; and they began to enter in and to do the work in the house of Jehovah of armies their God. + 15 It was on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Da·riʹus + the king.
