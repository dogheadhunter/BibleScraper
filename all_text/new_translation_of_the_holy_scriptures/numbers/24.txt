I had said to myself I was without fail going to honor you, + but, look! Jehovah has held you back from honor.” 12 In turn Baʹlaam said to Baʹlak: “Was it not also to your messengers whom you sent to me that I spoke, saying, 13 ‘If Baʹlak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I should not be able to pass beyond the order of Jehovah so as to do something good or bad out of my own heart. Whatever Jehovah may speak is what I shall speak’? + 14 And now here I am going away to my people. Do come, let me advise you + what this people will do to your people afterward in the end of the days.” + 15 So he took up his proverbial utterance + and said: “The utterance of Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor, And the utterance of the able-bodied man * with the eye unsealed, * + 16 The utterance of the one hearing the sayings of God, * + And the one knowing the knowledge of the Most High— A vision of the Almighty he got to see + While falling down with the eyes uncovered: + 17 I shall see him, + but not now; I shall behold him, but not near. A star * + will certainly step forth * out of Jacob, And a scepter * will indeed rise out of Israel. + And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moʹab’s [head] + And the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war. * 18 And Eʹdom must become a possession, + Yes, Seʹir + must become the possession of his enemies, + While Israel is displaying his courage. 19 And out of Jacob one will go subduing, * + And he must destroy any survivor from the city.” + 20 When he got to see Amʹa·lek, he carried further his proverbial utterance and went on to say: + “Amʹa·lek was the first one * of the nations, + But his end afterward will be even his perishing.” * + 21 When he got to see the Kenʹites, + he carried further his proverbial utterance and went on to say: “Durable is your dwelling, and set on the crag is your abode. * 22 But there will come to be one to burn Kaʹin * + down. How long will it be till As·syrʹi·a will carry you away captive?” + 23 And he carried further his proverbial utterance and went on to say: “Woe! Who will survive when God * causes it? + 24 And there will be ships from the coast of Kitʹtim, + And they will certainly afflict As·syrʹi·a, + And they will indeed afflict Eʹber. * But he too will eventually perish.” 25 After that Baʹlaam got up and went and returned to his place. + And Baʹlak also went his own way.
