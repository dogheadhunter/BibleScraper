Thus he anointed them and sanctified them. + 2 Then the chieftains of Israel, + the heads of the house of their fathers, made a presentation, + they being the chieftains of the tribes and standing over the ones registered, 3 and they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered wagons and twelve cattle, a wagon for two chieftains and a bull for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4 At this Jehovah said to Moses: 5 “Accept them from them, as they must serve for carrying on the service of the tent of meeting, and you must give them to the Levites, each one in proportion to his own service.” 6 So Moses accepted the wagons and the cattle and gave them to the Levites. 7 Two wagons and four cattle he gave to the sons of Gerʹshon in proportion to their service, + 8 and four wagons and eight cattle he gave to the sons of Me·rarʹi in proportion to their service, + under the hand of Ithʹa·mar the son of Aaron the priest. + 9 But to the sons of Koʹhath he gave none, because the service of the holy place was upon them. + They did their carrying on the shoulder. + 10 Now the chieftains made their presentation at * the inauguration + of the altar on the day of its being anointed, and the chieftains proceeded with presenting their offering before the altar. 11 So Jehovah said to Moses: “One chieftain on one day and another chieftain on another day is the way they will present their offering for the inauguration of the altar.” + 12 Now the one presenting his offering on the first day proved to be Nahʹshon + the son of Am·minʹa·dab of the tribe of Judah. 13 And his offering was one silver dish, its weight being a hundred and thirty shekels, * one silver bowl of seventy shekels by the shekel of the holy place, + both of them full of fine flour moistened with oil for a grain offering; + 14 one gold cup * of ten shekels, full of incense; + 15 one young bull, one ram, one male lamb in its first year, for a burnt offering; + 16 one kid of the goats for a sin offering; + 17 and for a communion + sacrifice two cattle, five rams, five he-goats, five male lambs each a year old.
