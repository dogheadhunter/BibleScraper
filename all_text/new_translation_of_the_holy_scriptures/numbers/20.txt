We shall not pass through a field or a vineyard, and we shall not drink the water of a well. On the king’s road we shall march. + We shall not bend toward the right or the left, + until we shall pass through your territory.’” 18 However, Eʹdom said to him: “You must not pass through me, for fear I may come out with the sword to meet you.” 19 In turn the sons of Israel said to him: “By the highway we shall go up; and if I and my livestock should drink your water, I shall also certainly give the value of it. + I want nothing more than to pass through on my feet.” + 20 Still he said: “You must not pass through.” + With that Eʹdom + came on out to encounter him with a great many people and a strong hand. 21 So Eʹdom refused to grant Israel to pass through his territory. + Hence Israel turned away from him. + 22 And the sons of Israel, the entire assembly, proceeded to pull away from Kaʹdesh + and come to Mount Hor. + 23 Then Jehovah said this to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor by the border of the land of Eʹdom: 24 “Aaron will be gathered to his people, + for he will not enter into the land that I shall certainly give to the sons of Israel, on the ground that YOU men rebelled against my order respecting the waters of Merʹi·bah. + 25 Take Aaron and El·e·aʹzar his son and bring them up into Mount Hor. 26 And strip Aaron of his garments, + and you must clothe with them El·e·aʹzar + his son; and Aaron will be gathered and must die there.” + 27 So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded; and before the eyes of all the assembly they went climbing Mount Hor. 28 Then Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and clothed El·e·aʹzar his son with them, after which Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. + And Moses and El·e·aʹzar came on down from the mountain. 29 And all the assembly got to see that Aaron had expired, and all the house of Israel continued weeping for Aaron thirty days. + Footnotes ^ Sy and one Heb. ms add “and Aaron.” ^ Or, “the cliff ( rock-mass ).” Heb., has· seʹlaʽ ; Gr., peʹtras ; Syr., kiʼ·phaʼ ; Lat., peʹtra . ^ Lit., “and it must give.” ^ Or, “so that he might be sanctified.” ^ Meaning “Quarreling; Strife; Contention.” Heb., Meri·vahʹ .
