According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they should get an inheritance. 56 By the determination of the lot one’s inheritance should be apportioned between the many and the few.” 57 Now these were the registered ones of the Levites + by their families: Of Gerʹshon + the family of the Gerʹshon·ites; of Koʹhath + the family of the Koʹhath·ites; of Me·rarʹi + the family of the Me·rarʹites. 58 These were the families of the Levites: * the family of the Libʹnites, + the family of the Heʹbron·ites, + the family of the Mahʹlites, + the family of the Muʹshites, + the family of the Koʹrah·ites. + And Koʹhath + became father to Amʹram. + 59 And the name of Amʹram’s wife was Jochʹe·bed, + Leʹvi’s daughter, whom his wife bore * to Leʹvi in Egypt. In time she bore to Amʹram Aaron and Moses and Mirʹi·am their sister. + 60 Then there were born to Aaron Naʹdab and A·biʹhu, + El·e·aʹzar and Ithʹa·mar. + 61 But Naʹdab and A·biʹhu died for their presenting illegitimate fire before Jehovah. + 62 And their registered ones amounted to twenty-three thousand, all males from a month old and upward. + For they did not get registered in among the sons of Israel, + because no inheritance was to be given to them in among the sons of Israel. + 63 These were the ones registered by Moses and El·e·aʹzar the priest when they registered the sons of Israel in the desert plains of Moʹab by the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho. + 64 But among these there did not prove to be a man of those registered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they registered the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Siʹnai. + 65 For Jehovah had said concerning them: “They will die without fail in the wilderness.” + So there was not left of them a man except Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh and Joshua the son of Nun. + Footnotes ^ M ends chapter 25 here with the foregoing clause as vs 19. ^ “Son,” Vg; MSamLXXSy, “sons.” ^ “Then the earth opened its mouth and the earth swallowed them up, when the assembly died, when the fire consumed Korah and two hundred and fifty men,” Sam. ^ “Jemuel” in Ge 46:10; Ex 6:15 . ^ “Zohar” in Ge 46:10; Ex 6:15 . ^ “Ziphion” in Ge 46:16 . ^ “Ez­bon” in Ge 46:16 . ^ “Arodi” in Ge 46:16 . ^ “Iob” in Ge 46:13 . ^ “Ehi” in Ge 46:21 . ^ “Muppim” in Ge 46:21 ; “Shuppim” in 1Ch 7:12 . ^ “Huppim” in Ge 46:21 . ^ “[Of Ard],” in agreement with SamLXXVg. ^ “Hushim” in Ge 46:23 . ^ “The Levites,” Sy; MVg, “Levi”; LXX, “the sons of Levi.” ^ “Daughter who proceeded to bear these,” LXX; SyVg, “daughter who was born.” Previous Next Print Share Share
