Only it is to the family of the tribe of their fathers that they should become wives. + 7 And no inheritance of the sons of Israel should circulate from tribe to tribe, because the sons of Israel should cleave each one to the inheritance of the tribe of his forefathers. 8 And every daughter getting possession of an inheritance out of the tribes of the sons of Israel, to one of the family of the tribe of her father she should become a wife, + in order that the sons of Israel may get possession each one of the inheritance of his forefathers. 9 And no inheritance should circulate from one tribe to another tribe, because the tribes of the sons of Israel should cleave each to its own inheritance.’” 10 Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, that is the way the daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had did. + 11 Accordingly Mahʹlah, Tirʹzah and Hogʹlah and Milʹcah and Noah, the daughters of Ze·loʹphe·had, + became the wives of the sons of their father’s brothers. * 12 To some of the families of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh the son of Joseph they became wives, that their inheritance might continue together with the tribe of the family of their father. 13 These are the commandments + and the judicial decisions that Jehovah commanded by means of Moses to the sons of Israel on the desert plains of Moʹab by the Jordan at Jerʹi·cho. + Footnotes ^ LXXSy add, “and before Eleazar the priest.” ^ Or, “the head fathers; the chief fathers.” ^ Lit., “one.” ^ Or, “tribes.” ^ Or, “their paternal uncles.” Previous Next Print Share Share
