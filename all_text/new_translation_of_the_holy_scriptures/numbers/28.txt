With the same grain offering as of the morning and with its same drink offering you will render it up as an offering made by fire, of a restful odor to Jehovah. + 9 “‘However, on the sabbath + day there will be two sound year-old male lambs and two tenth measures of fine flour as a grain offering moistened with oil, together with its drink offering, 10 as a sabbath burnt offering on its sabbath, * along with the constant burnt offering + and its drink offering. + 11 “‘And at the commencements of YOUR months YOU people will present as a burnt offering to Jehovah two young bulls and one ram, seven sound male lambs each a year old, + 12 and three tenth measures of fine flour as a grain offering + moistened with oil for each bull and two tenth measures of fine flour as a grain offering moistened with oil for the one ram, + 13 and a tenth measure of fine flour respectively as a grain offering moistened with oil for each male lamb, as a burnt offering, a restful odor, + an offering made by fire to Jehovah. 14 And as their drink offerings there should go half + a hin of wine for a bull and a third + of a hin for the ram and a fourth + of a hin for a male lamb. * This is the monthly burnt offering in its month for the months of the year. + 15 Also, one kid + of the goats should be rendered up as a sin offering to Jehovah in addition to the constant burnt offering together with its drink offering. + 16 “‘And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, will be Jehovah’s passover. + 17 And on the fifteenth day of this month will be a festival. Seven days unfermented cakes will be eaten. + 18 On the first day there will be a holy convention. + No sort of laborious work must YOU do. + 19 And YOU must present as an offering made by fire, a burnt offering + to Jehovah, two young bulls and one ram and seven male lambs each a year old. + They should prove to be sound ones for YOU . + 20 And as their grain offerings + of fine flour moistened with oil YOU will render up three tenth measures for a bull and two tenth measures + for the ram. 21 You will render up a tenth measure + respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs; 22 and one goat of sin offering to make atonement for YOU . + 23 Aside from the morning burnt offering, which is for the constant + burnt offering, + YOU will render these up. 24 The same as these YOU will render up daily for the seven days as bread, + an offering made by fire, of a restful odor to Jehovah. + Along with the constant burnt offering it should be rendered, and its drink offering. 25 And on the seventh day YOU should hold a holy convention. + No sort of laborious work must YOU do. + 26 “‘And on the day of the first ripe fruits, + when YOU present a new grain offering to Jehovah, in YOUR feast of weeks + YOU should hold a holy convention. No sort of laborious work must YOU do. + 27 And YOU must present as a burnt offering for a restful odor to Jehovah two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs each a year old; + 28 and as their grain offering of fine flour moistened with oil three tenth measures for each bull, two tenth measures + for the one ram, 29 a tenth measure + respectively for each male lamb of the seven male lambs; 30 one kid of the goats to make atonement for YOU . + 31 Aside from the constant burnt offering and its grain offering YOU will render them up. + They should prove to be sound ones for YOU , + together with their drink offerings. + Footnotes ^ “At their appointed times,” SyVg; M, “at its appointed time.” ^ See Ex 12:6 ftn. ^ “As a burnt offering sabbath by sabbath,” SamSy. ^ Lit., “the male lamb,” M; LXX, “each male lamb.” Previous Next Print Share Share
