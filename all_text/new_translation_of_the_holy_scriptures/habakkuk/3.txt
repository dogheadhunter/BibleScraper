In the midst of [the] years may you make it known. During the agitation, to show mercy may you remember. + 3 God * himself proceeded to come from Teʹman, * even a Holy One from Mount Paʹran. + Seʹlah. * + His dignity covered [the] heavens; + and with his praise the earth became filled. + 4 As for [his] * brightness, it got to be just like the light. + He had two rays * [issuing] out of his hand, and there the hiding of his strength was. + 5 Before him pestilence kept going, + and burning fever would go forth at his feet. + 6 He stood still, that he might shake up [the] earth. + He saw, and then caused nations to leap. + And the eternal mountains got to be smashed; + the indefinitely lasting hills bowed down. + The walkings of long ago are his. 7 Under what is hurtful I saw the tents of Cuʹshan. * The tent cloths of the land of Midʹi·an + began to be agitated. + 8 Is it against the rivers, O Jehovah, is it against the rivers that your anger has become hot, + or is your fury against the sea? + For you went riding upon your horses; + your chariots were salvation. + 9 In [its] nakedness your bow comes to be uncovered. + The sworn oaths of [the] tribes are the thing said. * + Seʹlah. With rivers you proceeded to split [the] earth. + 10 Mountains saw you; they got to be in severe pains. + A thunderstorm of waters passed through. The watery deep * gave forth its sound. + On high its hands it lifted up. 11 Sun—moon—stood still, + in the lofty abode thereof. + Like light your own arrows kept going. + The lightning of your spear served for brightness. + 12 With denunciation you went marching [through] the earth. In anger you went threshing [the] nations. + 13 And you went forth for the salvation of your people, + to save your anointed one. * You broke to pieces the head one out of the house of the wicked one. + There was a laying of the foundation bare, clear up to the neck. + Seʹlah. 14 With his own rods you pierced + [the] head of his warriors [when] they moved tempestuously to scatter me. + Their high glee was as of those bent on devouring an afflicted one in a place of concealment. + 15 Through the sea you trod [with] your horses, [through] the heap of vast waters. + 16 I heard, and my belly began to be agitated; at the sound my lips quivered; rottenness began to enter into my bones; + and in my situation I was agitated, that I should quietly wait for * the day of distress, + for [his] coming up to the people, + [that] he may raid them. 17 Although [the] fig tree itself may not blossom, + and there may be no yield on the vines; the work of [the] olive tree may actually turn out a failure, and the terraces themselves may actually produce no food; + [the] flock may actually be severed from [the] pen, and there may be no herd in the enclosures; + 18 Yet, as for me, I will exult in Jehovah himself; + I will be joyful in the God * of my salvation. + 19 Jehovah the Sovereign Lord is my vital energy; + and he will make my feet like those of the hinds, + and upon my high places he will cause me to tread. + Footnotes ^ “Dirges.” Heb., shigh·yo·nohthʹ; LXX, “a song”; Vg, “(for) ignorant acts; (for) ignorances.” See Ps 7:Sup ftn, “Dirge.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah, sing.; Gr., The·osʹ; Lat., Deʹus . ^ “From Teman.” Heb., mit·Teh·manʹ; Gr., ek Thai·manʹ .
