And [why] are despoiling and violence in front of me, and [why] does quarreling occur, and [why] is strife carried? + 4 Therefore law grows numb, and justice never goes forth. + Because the wicked one is surrounding the righteous one, for that reason justice goes forth crooked. + 5 “See, YOU people, among the nations, and look on, and stare in amazement at one another. + Be amazed; for there is an activity that one is carrying on * in YOUR days, [which] YOU people will not believe although it is related. * + 6 For here I am raising up the Chal·deʹans, + the nation bitter and impetuous, which is going to the wide-open places of earth in order to take possession of residences not belonging to it. + 7 Frightful and fear-inspiring it is. From itself its own justice and its own dignity go forth. + 8 And its horses have proved swifter than leopards, and they have proved fiercer than evening wolves. + And its steeds have pawed the ground, and from far away its own steeds * come. They fly like the eagle speeding to eat [something]. + 9 In its entirety it comes for mere violence. + The assembling of their faces is as [the] east wind, * + and it gathers up captives just like the sand. 10 And for its part, it jeers kings themselves, and high officials are something laughable to it. + For its part, it laughs even at every fortified place, + and it piles up dust and captures it. 11 At that time it will certainly move onward [like] wind * and will pass through and will actually become guilty. + This its power is due to its god.” * + 12 Are you not from long ago, O Jehovah? + O my God, * my Holy One, you do not die. * + O Jehovah, for a judgment you have set it; and, O Rock, + for a reproving + you have founded it. 13 You are too pure in eyes to see what is bad; and to look on trouble you are not able. + Why is it that you look on those dealing treacherously, + that you keep silent when someone wicked swallows up someone more righteous than he is? + 14 And [why] do you make earthling man like the fishes of the sea, like creeping things over whom no one is ruling? + 15 All these he has brought up with a mere fishhook; + he drags them away in his dragnet, and he gathers them in his fishing net. + That is why he rejoices and is joyful. + 16 That is why he offers sacrifice to his dragnet and makes sacrificial smoke to his fishing net; for by them his portion is well oiled, and his food is healthful. * + 17 Is that why he will empty out his dragnet, and does he have to kill nations constantly, while he shows no compassion? + Footnotes ^ “One is carrying on,” M; LXXSy, “I am carrying on.” ^ “Behold it, you scorners, and look, and wonder marvelously, and vanish away, because I am working a work in your days, which you will by no means believe even if anyone relates it in detail,” LXX.
