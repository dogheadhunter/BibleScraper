Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it; for it will without fail come true. + It will not be late. 4 “Look! His soul * has been swelled up; + it has not been upright within him. * But as for the righteous one, by his faithfulness he will keep living. + 5 And, indeed, because the wine is dealing treacherously, + an able-bodied man is self-assuming; + and he will not reach his goal, + he who has made his soul spacious just like Sheʹol, * and who is like death and cannot be satisfied. + And he keeps gathering to himself all the nations and collecting together to himself all the peoples. + 6 Will not these very ones, all of them, lift up against him a proverbial saying + and an alluding remark, insinuations at him? And one will say, “‘Woe to him who is multiplying what is not his own + —O how long! + —and who is making debt heavy against himself! 7 Will not those claiming interest of you rise up suddenly, and those wake up who are violently shaking you, and you certainly become to them something to pillage? + 8 Because you yourself despoiled many nations, all the remaining ones of [the] peoples will despoil you, + because of the shedding of blood of mankind * and the violence to [the] earth, [the] town and all those dwelling in it. + 9 “‘Woe to the one that is making evil gain for his house, + in order to set his nest on the height, so as to be delivered from the grasp * of what is calamitous! + 10 You have counseled something shameful to your house, the cutting off of many peoples; + and your soul is sinning. + 11 For out of [the] wall a stone itself will cry out plaintively, and from the woodwork a rafter * itself will answer it. + 12 “‘Woe to the one that is building a city by bloodshed, * and that has solidly established a town by unrighteousness! + 13 Look! Is it not from Jehovah of armies * that peoples will toil on only for the fire, and that national groups will tire themselves out merely for nothing? + 14 For the earth will be filled with the knowing of the glory of Jehovah * as the waters themselves cover over [the] sea. + 15 “‘Woe to the one giving his companions something to drink, attaching [to it] your rage * and anger, in order to make [them] drunk, + for the purpose of looking upon their parts of shame. + 16 You will certainly be satiated with dishonor instead of glory. + Drink also, you yourself, + and be considered uncircumcised. + The cup of the right hand of Jehovah * will come around to you, + and there will be disgrace upon your glory; 17 because the violence [done] to Lebʹa·non + is what will cover you, and the rapacity upon [the] beasts that terrifies them, because of the shedding of blood of mankind * and the violence [done] to [the] earth, + the town and all those dwelling in it. + 18 Of what benefit has a carved image been, + when the former of it has carved it, a molten statue, and an instructor in falsehood? + when the former of its form has trusted in it, + to the extent of making valueless gods * that are speechless? + 19 “‘Woe to the one saying to the piece of wood: “O do awake!” to a dumb stone: “O wake up! It itself will give instruction”! + Look! It is sheathed in gold and silver, + and there is no breath * at all in the midst of it. + 20 But Jehovah * is in his holy temple. * + Keep silence before him, all the earth!’” + Footnotes ^ Or, “with; to.” ^ “Bulwark.” Heb., ma·tsohrʹ; Gr., peʹtran, and Syr., kiʼ·phaʼ, “rock”; Lat., mu·ni·ti·oʹnem, “fortification.” ^ Lit., “may run.” ^ “It is a disclosure for the end,” by a slight correction. ^ “His soul .” Heb., naph·sh ohʹ; Lat., aʹni·ma .
