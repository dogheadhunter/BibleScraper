What can * man do to me?” + 7 Remember those who are taking the lead among YOU , * + who have spoken the word of God to YOU , and as YOU contemplate how [their] conduct turns out imitate + [their] faith. + 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever. + 9 Do not be carried away with various and strange teachings; + for it is fine for the heart to be given firmness * by undeserved kindness, + not by eatables, + by which those who occupy themselves with them have not been benefited. 10 We have an altar from which those who do sacred service * at the tent * have no authority * to eat. + 11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place * by the high priest for sin are burned up outside the camp. + 12 Hence Jesus also, that he might sanctify + the people with his own blood, + suffered outside the gate. + 13 Let us, then, go forth to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore, * + 14 for we do not have here a city that continues, + but we are earnestly seeking the one to come. + 15 Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, + that is, the fruit of lips + which make public declaration * to his name. + 16 Moreover, do not forget the doing of good + and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. + 17 Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among YOU * + and be submissive, * + for they are keeping watch over YOUR souls as those who will render an account; + that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to YOU . + 18 Carry on prayer + for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things. + 19 But I exhort YOU more especially to do this, that I may be restored to YOU the sooner. + 20 Now may the God of peace, + who brought up from the dead + the great shepherd + of the sheep + with the blood of an everlasting covenant, + our Lord Jesus, 21 equip YOU with every good thing to do his will, performing in us through Jesus Christ that which is well-pleasing in his sight; + to whom be the glory forever and ever. + Amen. 22 Now I exhort YOU , brothers, to bear with this word of encouragement, for I have, indeed, composed a letter to YOU in few words. + 23 Take note that our brother Timothy + has been released, with whom, if he comes quite soon, * I shall see YOU . 24 Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead + among YOU * and to all the holy ones. Those in * Italy + send YOU their greetings. 25 The undeserved kindness + be with all of YOU . * Footnotes ^ Lit., “having treated as strangers.” ^ Or, “kindness to strangers.” ^ “Adulterers.” Lat., a·dulʹte·ros . ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “will.” ^ Or, “are governors of you.” Gr., he·gou·meʹnon hy·monʹ .
