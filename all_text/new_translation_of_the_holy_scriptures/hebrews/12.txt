For the joy that was set before him he endured + a torture stake, * despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. + 3 Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such contrary talk + by sinners against their own interests, * that YOU may not get tired and give out in YOUR souls. + 4 In carrying on YOUR contest against that sin YOU have never yet resisted as far as blood, + 5 but YOU have entirely forgotten the exhortation which addresses YOU as sons: + “My son, do not belittle [the] discipline from Jehovah, * neither give out when you are corrected * by him; + 6 for whom Jehovah * loves he disciplines; in fact, he scourges every one whom he receives as a son.” + 7 It is for discipline + YOU are enduring. God is dealing with YOU as with sons. + For what son is he that a father does not discipline? + 8 But if YOU are without the discipline of which all have become partakers, YOU are really illegitimate children, + and not sons. 9 Furthermore, we used to have fathers who were of our flesh to discipline us, + and we used to give them respect. Shall we not much more subject ourselves to the Father of our spiritual life * and live? + 10 For they for a few days used to discipline us according to what seemed good to them, + but he does so for our profit that we may partake of his holiness. + 11 True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; + yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, + namely, * righteousness. + 12 Hence straighten up the hands that hang down + and the enfeebled knees, + 13 and keep making straight paths for YOUR feet, + that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather that it may be healed. + 14 Pursue peace with all people, + and the sanctification + without which no man will see the Lord, + 15 carefully watching that no one may be deprived of the undeserved kindness of God; + that no poisonous root + may spring up and cause trouble and that many may not be defiled by it; + 16 that there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things, like Eʹsau, + who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn. + 17 For YOU know that afterward also when he wanted to inherit the blessing + he was rejected, + for, although he earnestly sought a change of mind * with tears, + he found no place for it. + 18 For YOU have not approached that which can be felt + and which has been set aflame with fire, + and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a tempest, + 19 and the blare of a trumpet + and the voice of words; + on hearing which voice the people implored that no word should be added to them. + 20 For the command was not bearable to them: “And if a beast touches the mountain, it must be stoned.” + 21 Also, the display * was so fearsome that Moses said: “I am fearful and trembling.” + 22 But YOU have approached a Mount Zion + and a city + of [the] living God, heavenly Jerusalem, + and myriads * of angels, + 23 in general assembly, * + and the congregation of the firstborn + who have been enrolled * + in the heavens, and God the Judge of all, + and the spiritual lives * + of righteous ones who have been made perfect, + 24 and Jesus the mediator * + of a new covenant, + and the blood of sprinkling, + which speaks in a better way than Abel’s [blood]. + 25 See that YOU do not beg off from him who is speaking. + For if they did not escape who begged off from him who was giving divine warning upon earth, + much more shall we not if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens. + 26 At that time his voice shook the earth, + but now he has promised, saying: “Yet once more I will set in commotion not only the earth but also the heaven.” + 27 Now the expression “Yet once more” signifies the removal of the things being shaken as things that have been made, + in order that the things not being shaken may remain. + 28 Wherefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken, + let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service * with godly fear and awe. + 29 For our God is also a consuming fire. + Footnotes ^ “Of witnesses.” Gr., mar·tyʹron; Lat., teʹsti·um; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ʽe·dhimʹ . ^ Lit., “Chief Leader.” Gr., ar·khe·gonʹ . ^ See App 5C . ^ “Against their own interests,” P 46 א VgSy p ; AVg c Sy h , “against him himself.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “being reproved.” ^ See App 1D . ^ “Of our spiritual life.” Lit., “of the spirits .” Gr., ton pneu·maʹton ; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ha· ru·chohthʹ . ^ Or, “fruit of.” ^ “Change of mind,” that is, a change of Isaac’s mind.
