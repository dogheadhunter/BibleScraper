We are the house of that One, + if we make fast our hold on our freeness of speech and our boasting over the hope firm to the end. * + 7 For this reason, just as the holy spirit + says: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice, + 8 do not harden YOUR hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger, * + as in the day of making the test + in the wilderness, + 9 in which YOUR forefathers made a test of me with a trial, and yet they had seen my works + for forty years. + 10 For this reason I became disgusted with this generation and said, ‘They always go astray in their hearts, + and they themselves have not come to know my ways.’ + 11 So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall not enter + into my rest.’” + 12 Beware, brothers, for fear there should ever develop in any one of YOU a wicked heart lacking faith * by drawing away * from the living God; + 13 but keep on exhorting + one another each day, as long as it may be called “Today,” + for fear any one of YOU should become hardened by the deceptive + power * of sin. 14 For we actually become partakers of the Christ + only if we make fast our hold on the confidence we had at the beginning firm to the end, * + 15 while it is being said: “Today if YOU people listen to his own voice, + do not harden YOUR hearts as on the occasion of causing bitter anger.” + 16 For who were they that heard and yet provoked to bitter anger? + Did not, in fact, all do so who went out of Egypt under Moses? + 17 Moreover, with whom did [God] * become disgusted for forty years? + Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? + 18 But to whom did he swear + that they should not enter into his rest except to those who acted disobediently? + 19 So we see that they could not enter in because of lack of faith. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “chief priest of our confession.” ^ Or, “invitation.” ^ Lit., “to be futurely spoken.” ^ See Nu 12:7 and ftn. ^ “Firm to the end,” א ACDVg; P 46 B omit. ^ Lit., “embitterment.” ^ “Lacking faith.” Lit., “of unbelief.” Gr., a·pi·stiʹas . ^ Lit., “to stand off.” Gr., a·po·steʹnai . ^ “Deceptive power.” Lit., “seduction.” ^ Or, “finish.” Gr., teʹlous . ^ Lit., “he.” Previous Next Print Share Share
