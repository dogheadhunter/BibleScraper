That is why God, your God, anointed + you with [the] oil of exultation more than your partners.” + 10 And: “You at [the] beginning, O Lord, laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are [the] works of your hands. + 11 They themselves will perish, * but you yourself are to remain continually; and just like an outer garment + they will all grow old, 12 and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, + as an outer garment; * and they will be changed, but you are the same, and your years will never run out.” + 13 But with reference to which one of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”? + 14 Are they not all spirits + for public service, + sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit + salvation?
