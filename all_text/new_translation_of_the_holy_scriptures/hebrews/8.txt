There are days coming,’ says Jehovah, * ‘and I will conclude with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant; + 9 not according to the covenant + that I made with their forefathers in [the] day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt, + because they did not continue in my covenant, + so that I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah.” * + 10 “‘For this is the covenant that I shall covenant with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. * ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts + I shall write them. And I will become their God, + and they themselves will become my people. + 11 “‘And they will by no means teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” * + For they will all know me, + from [the] least one to [the] greatest one of them. 12 For I shall be merciful to their unrighteous deeds, and I shall by no means call their sins + to mind anymore.’” + 13 In his saying “a new [covenant]” he has made the former one obsolete. * + Now that which is made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away. + Footnotes ^ See 1:3 ftn, “Majesty.” ^ Lit., “public worker.” Gr., lei·tour·gosʹ . ^ Or, “places.” ^ Or, “tabernacle.” ^ See App 1D . ^ “Typical representation.” Lit., “example.” ^ Lit., “has been divinely warned.” ^ Or, “type.” Gr., tyʹpon; Lat., ex·emʹplar . ^ Lit., “he.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ “He has made . . . obsolete.” Lit., “he has made old.” Previous Next Print Share Share
