and through it he, although he died, yet speaks. + 5 By faith Eʹnoch + was transferred so as not to see death, and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him; + for before his transference he had the witness that he had pleased God well. + 6 Moreover, without faith + it is impossible to please [him] well, + for he that approaches God must believe that he is + and that he becomes the rewarder * + of those earnestly seeking him. + 7 By faith Noah, + after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, + showed godly fear and constructed an ark + for the saving of his household; and through this [faith] he condemned the world, + and he became an heir of the righteousness + that is according to faith. 8 By faith Abraham, + when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going. + 9 By faith he resided as an alien in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, + and dwelt in tents + with Isaac + and Jacob, + the heirs with him of the very same promise. + 10 For he was awaiting the city + having real foundations, the builder * and maker of which [city] is God. + 11 By faith also Sarah + herself received power to conceive seed, even when she was past the age limit, + since she esteemed him faithful who had promised. + 12 Hence also from one [man], + and him as good as dead, + there were born [children] just as the stars of heaven for multitude and as the sands that are by the seaside, innumerable. + 13 In faith all these died, + although they did not get the [fulfillment of the] promises, + but they saw them afar off + and welcomed * them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land. + 14 For those who say such things give evidence that they are earnestly seeking a place of their own. + 15 And yet, if they had indeed kept remembering that [place] from which they had gone forth, + they would have had opportunity to return. + 16 But now they are reaching out for a better [place], that is, one belonging to heaven. + Hence God is not ashamed of them, to be called upon as their God, + for he has made a city + ready for them. 17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, + as good as offered * up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted * to offer up [his] only-begotten [son], + 18 although it had been said to him: “What will be called ‘your seed’ will be through Isaac.” + 19 But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; + and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way. * + 20 By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob + and Eʹsau + concerning things to come. 21 By faith Jacob, when about to die, + blessed each of the sons of Joseph + and worshiped leaning * upon the top of his staff. + 22 By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus + of the sons of Israel; and he gave a command concerning his bones. + 23 By faith Moses was hid for three months by his parents after his birth, + because they saw the young child was beautiful + and they did not fear the order + of the king. 24 By faith Moses, when grown up, + refused * to be called the son of the daughter of Pharʹaoh, + 25 choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, 26 because he esteemed the reproach + of the Christ * as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward. + 27 By faith he left Egypt, + but not fearing the anger of the king, + for he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. + 28 By faith he had celebrated * the passover * + and the splashing of the blood, + that the destroyer might not touch their firstborn ones. + 29 By faith they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land, + but on venturing out upon it the Egyptians were swallowed up. + 30 By faith the walls of Jerʹi·cho fell down after they had been encircled * for seven days. + 31 By faith Raʹhab + the harlot did not perish with those who acted disobediently, because she received the spies in a peaceable way. + 32 And what more shall I say? For the time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gidʹe·on, + Baʹrak, + Samson, + Jephʹthah, + David + as well as Samuel + and the [other] prophets, + 33 who through faith defeated kingdoms in conflict, + effected righteousness, + obtained promises, + stopped the mouths of lions, + 34 stayed the force of fire, + escaped the edge * of the sword, + from a weak state were made powerful, + became valiant in war, + routed the armies of foreigners. + 35 Women received their dead by resurrection; + but other [men] were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection. 36 Yes, others received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by bonds + and prisons. + 37 They were stoned, + they were tried, + they were sawn asunder, they died + by slaughter with the sword, they went about in sheepskins, + in goatskins, while they were in want, + in tribulation, + under ill-treatment; + 38 and the world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and mountains and caves + and dens of the earth. 39 And yet all these, although they had witness borne to them through their faith, did not get the [fulfillment of the] promise, + 40 as God foresaw * something better + for us, + in order that they + might not be made perfect + apart from us. + Footnotes ^ “Assured expectation.” Lit., “a sub-standing.” Gr., hy·poʹsta·sis; Lat., sub·stanʹti·a . ^ “Evident demonstration.” Or, “convincing evidence.” Gr., eʹleg·khos; Lat., ar·gu·menʹtum .
