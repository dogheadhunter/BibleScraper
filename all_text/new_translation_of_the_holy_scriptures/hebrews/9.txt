But now he has manifested himself + once + for all time at the conclusion * of the systems of things * + to put sin away through the sacrifice of himself. + 27 And as it is reserved for men + to die once for all time, but after this a judgment, + 28 so also the Christ was offered once + for all time to bear the sins of many; + and the second time + that he appears + it will be apart from sin * + and to those earnestly looking for him for [their] salvation. + Footnotes ^ “Sacred service.” Gr., la·treiʹas; J 22 (Heb.), ʽavoh·dhahʹ .
