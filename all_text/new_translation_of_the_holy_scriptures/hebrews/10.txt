I am come (in the roll of the book * it is written about me) + to do your will, O God.’” + 8 After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin [offering]” + —[sacrifices] that are offered according to the Law + — 9 then he actually says: “Look! I am come to do your will.” * + He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second. + 10 By the said “will” + we have been sanctified + through the offering + of the body of Jesus Christ once + for all time. 11 Also, every priest takes his station + from day to day + to render public service and to offer the same sacrifices often, as these are at no time able to take sins away completely. + 12 But this [man] offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually + and sat down at the right hand of God, + 13 from then on awaiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet. + 14 For it is by one [sacrificial] offering + that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect + perpetually. 15 Moreover, the holy spirit + also bears witness to us, for after it has said: 16 “‘This is the covenant that I shall covenant toward them after those days,’ says Jehovah. * ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I shall write them,’” + 17 [it says afterwards:] * “And I shall by no means call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind anymore.” + 18 Now where there is forgiveness + of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. + 19 Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness * for the way of entry + into the holy place * + by the blood of Jesus, 20 which he inaugurated for us as a new and living way through the curtain, + that is, his flesh, + 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, + 22 let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience + and our bodies bathed with clean water. + 23 Let us hold fast the public declaration * of our hope + without wavering, + for he is faithful + that promised. 24 And let us consider one another to incite + to love and fine works, + 25 not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, + as some have the custom, but encouraging + one another, and all the more so as YOU behold the day drawing near. + 26 For if we practice sin willfully + after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, + there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, + 27 but [there is] a certain fearful expectation of judgment + and [there is] a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition. + 28 Any man that has disregarded the law of Moses dies without compassion, upon the testimony of two or three. + 29 Of how much more severe a punishment, + do YOU think, will the man be counted worthy who has trampled + upon the Son of God and who has esteemed as of ordinary value the blood + of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit + of undeserved kindness with contempt? 30 For we know him that said: “Vengeance is mine; I will recompense”; * + and again: “Jehovah * will judge his people.” + 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of [the] living God. + 32 However, keep on remembering the former days in which, after YOU were enlightened, + YOU endured a great contest under sufferings, + 33 sometimes while YOU were being exposed as in a theater + both to reproaches and tribulations, and sometimes while YOU became sharers with those who were having such an experience. + 34 For YOU both expressed sympathy for those in prison and joyfully took the plundering + of YOUR belongings, knowing YOU yourselves have a better and an abiding possession. + 35 Do not, therefore, throw away YOUR freeness of speech, + which has a great reward + to be paid it. 36 For YOU have need of endurance, + in order that, after YOU have done the will of God, + YOU may receive the [fulfillment of the] promise. + 37 For yet “a very little while,” + and “he who is coming will arrive and will not delay.” + 38 “But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,” + and, “if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.” + 39 Now we are not the sort that shrink back to destruction, + but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul. + Footnotes ^ “Rendering sacred service.” Gr., la·treuʹon·tas; J 18 (Heb.), ha· ʽo·vedhimʹ , “the ones serving ( worshiping ).” See Ex 3:12 ftn. ^ “Whole burnt offerings.” Gr., ho·lo·kau·toʹma·ta; Lat., ho·lo·cau·stoʹma·ta .
