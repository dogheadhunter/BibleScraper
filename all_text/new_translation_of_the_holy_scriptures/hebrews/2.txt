I and the young children, whom Jehovah * gave me.” + 14 Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, + that through his death + he might bring to nothing * + the one having the means to cause death, + that is, the Devil; * + 15 and [that] he might emancipate + all those who for fear of death + were subject to slavery all through their lives. + 16 For he is really not assisting angels at all, but he is assisting Abraham’s seed. + 17 Consequently he was obliged to become like his “brothers” in all respects, + that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest * in things pertaining to God, + in order to offer propitiatory + sacrifice * for the sins of the people. + 18 For in that he himself has suffered when being put to the test, + he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “more abundantly to be having [mind] toward.” ^ Lit., “paying back of reward.” ^ Lit., “having been unconcerned.” ^ Or, “various miracles.” ^ Lit., “inhabited.” Gr., oi·kou·meʹnen, fem. sing., referring to the earth; Lat., orʹbem terʹrae, “circle of the earth.” Compare Isa 13:11 ftn, “Land.” ^ Lit., “you are remembering.” ^ Or, “for a little while.” ^ “And appointed him over the works of your hands,” א ACD * VgSy p and Ps 8:6 ; P 46 BD c omit. ^ Lit., “he.” ^ Or, “every kind of.” ^ Or, “for a little while.” ^ Lit., “Chief Leader.” ^ Or, “those who are held sacred (treated as holy).” Gr., hoi ha·gi·a·zoʹme·noi; Lat., qui sanc·ti·fi·canʹtur; J 17,​22 (Heb.), ham·qud·da·shimʹ . ^ “Brothers.” Gr., a·del·phousʹ; Lat., fraʹtres; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), ʼa·chimʹ . ^ Lit., “of ecclesia.” Gr., ek·kle·siʹas; Lat., ec·cleʹsi·ae; J 17,​18,​22 (Heb.), qa·halʹ . ^ See App 1D . ^ “Devil,” א ABVg; Sy p J 17,​18,​22 , “Satan.” ^ Or, “he might destroy (render inactive).” ^ Lit., “chief priest.” ^ Lit., “to be making propitiation.” Previous Next Print Share Share
