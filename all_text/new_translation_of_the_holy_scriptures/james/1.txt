So, too, the rich man will fade away in his ways of life. + 12 Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial, + because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life, + which Jehovah * promised to those who continue loving him. + 13 When under trial, + let no one say: “I am being tried by God.” For with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. 14 But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed * by his own desire. + 15 Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; + in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. + 16 Do not be misled, + my beloved brothers. 17 Every good gift + and every perfect present is from above, + for it comes down from the Father of the [celestial] lights, + and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow. * + 18 Because he willed + it, he brought us forth by the word of truth, + for us to be certain firstfruits + of his creatures. 19 Know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, + slow about wrath; + 20 for man’s wrath does not work out God’s righteousness. + 21 Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, badness, + and accept with mildness the implanting of the word + which is able to save YOUR souls. * + 22 However, become doers of the word, + and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning. + 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, + this one is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror. 24 For he looks at himself, and off he goes and immediately forgets what sort of man he is. 25 But he who peers * into the perfect law + that belongs to freedom and who persists in [it], this [man], because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, + will be happy + in his doing [it]. 26 If any man seems to himself * to be a formal worshiper * + and yet does not bridle his tongue, + but goes on deceiving his own heart, + this man’s form of worship is futile. + 27 The form of worship * that is clean + and undefiled + from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans * + and widows + in their tribulation, + and to keep oneself without spot + from the world. + Footnotes ^ “That are scattered about.” Lit., “the (ones) in the dispersion [Gr., di·a·spo·raiʹ; Lat., di·sper·si·oʹne ].” ^ Lit., “Jacob.” Gr., I·aʹko·bos . “James” is an abbreviated English form of Jacob, meaning “Taking Hold of the Heel; Supplanter.” ^ Or, “this way of testing.” ^ Lit., “judging for self dividedly.” ^ See App 1D . ^ Lit., “two-souled.” Gr., diʹpsy·khos; Lat., duʹplex aʹni·mo . ^ “Jehovah,” J 7,​8,​13,​16,​17 ; C(Gr.), Kyʹri·os; ItVgSy p , “God”; א AB omit.
