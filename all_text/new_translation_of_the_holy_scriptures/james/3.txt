Even boats, although they are so big and are driven by hard winds, are steered by a very small rudder + to where the inclination of the man at the helm wishes. 5 So, too, the tongue is a little member and yet makes great brags. + Look! How little a fire it takes to set so great a woodland on fire! 6 Well, the tongue is a fire. + The tongue is constituted a world of unrighteousness among our members, for it spots up all the body + and sets the wheel of natural life aflame and it is set aflame by Ge·henʹna. * 7 For every species of wild beast as well as bird and creeping thing and sea creature is to be tamed and has been tamed by humankind. + 8 But the tongue, not one of mankind can get it tamed. An unruly injurious thing, it is full of death-dealing poison. + 9 With it we bless Jehovah, * + even [the] Father, + and yet with it we curse + men who have come into existence “in the likeness of God.” + 10 Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. It is not proper, my brothers, for these things to go on occurring this way. + 11 A fountain + does not cause the sweet and the bitter to bubble out of the same opening, does it? 12 My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives or a vine figs, can it? + Neither can salt water produce sweet water. 13 Who is wise and understanding among YOU ? Let him show out of his fine conduct his works + with a mildness that belongs to wisdom. 14 But if YOU have bitter jealousy + and contentiousness + in YOUR hearts, do not be bragging * + and lying against the truth. + 15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, + but is [the] earthly, + animal, * demonic. + 16 For where jealousy + and contentiousness are, there disorder * and every vile thing are. + 17 But the wisdom + from above is first of all chaste, + then peaceable, + reasonable, * + ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, + not making partial distinctions, + not hypocritical. + 18 Moreover, the fruit + of righteousness + has its seed sown under peaceful + conditions * for * those who are making peace. + Footnotes ^ See App 4C . ^ “Jehovah,” J 18,​23 ; א ABC(Gr.), ton Kyʹri·on; Vg c Sy h , “God.” See App 1D . ^ Lit., “not be you boasting down.” ^ Lit., “soulical.” Gr., psy·khi·keʹ; Lat., a·ni·maʹlis .
