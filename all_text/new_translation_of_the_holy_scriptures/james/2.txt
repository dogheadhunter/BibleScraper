God chose the ones who are poor + respecting the world to be rich + in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he promised to those who love him, + did he not? 6 Y OU , though, have dishonored the poor [man]. The rich oppress + YOU , and they drag YOU before law courts, * + do they not? 7 They blaspheme + the fine name by which YOU were called, + do they not? 8 If, now, YOU practice carrying out the kingly law + according to the scripture: “You must love your neighbor as yourself,” + YOU are doing quite well. 9 But if YOU continue showing favoritism, + YOU are working a sin, for YOU are reproved by the law + as transgressors. 10 For whoever observes all the Law but makes a false step * in one point, he has become an offender against them all. + 11 For he who said: “You must not commit adultery,” + said also: “You must not murder.” + If, now, you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of law. 12 Keep on speaking in such a way and keep on doing in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people. * + 13 For the one that does not practice mercy will have [his] judgment without mercy. + Mercy exults triumphantly over * judgment. 14 Of what benefit is it, my brothers, if a certain one says he has faith + but he does not have works? + That faith cannot save him, can it? + 15 If a brother or a sister is in a naked state and lacking the food sufficient for the day, + 16 yet a certain one of YOU says to them: “Go in peace, keep warm and well fed,” but YOU do not give them the necessities for [their] body, of what benefit is it? + 17 Thus, too, faith, if it does not have works, + is dead in itself. 18 Nevertheless, a certain one will say: “You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith apart from the works, and I shall show you my faith by my works.” + 19 You believe there is one God, do you? + You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder. * + 20 But do you care to know, O empty man, that faith apart from works is inactive? 21 Was not Abraham our father + declared righteous by works after he had offered up Isaac his son upon the altar? + 22 You behold that [his] faith worked along with his works and by [his] works [his] faith was perfected, + 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which says: “Abraham put faith in Jehovah, * and it was counted to him as righteousness,” + and he came to be called “Jehovah’s * friend.” + 24 Y OU see that a man is to be declared righteous + by works, + and not by faith alone. + 25 In the same manner was not also Raʹhab + the harlot declared righteous by works, after she had received the messengers hospitably and sent them out by another way? + 26 Indeed, as the body without spirit * is dead, + so also faith without works is dead. + Footnotes ^ Or, “My brothers, stop holding . . . of favoritism.” ^ “Gathering.” Gr., sy·na·go·genʹ . ^ Lit., “judgment places.” ^ Lit., “he might trip.” ^ Or, “law that belongs to freedom.” ^ Or, “as superior to.” ^ Lit., “they are bristling up.” ^ See App 1D . ^ See App 1D . ^ Or, “breath.” Previous Next Print Share Share
