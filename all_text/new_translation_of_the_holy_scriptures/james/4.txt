Are they not from this source, + namely, from YOUR cravings for sensual pleasure that carry on a conflict in YOUR members? + 2 Y OU desire, and yet YOU do not have. Y OU go on murdering + and coveting, * + and yet YOU are not able to obtain. Y OU go on fighting + and waging war. Y OU do not have because of YOUR not asking. 3 Y OU do ask, and yet YOU do not receive, because YOU are asking for a wrong purpose, + that YOU may expend [it] upon YOUR cravings for sensual pleasure. + 4 Adulteresses, * + do YOU not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? + Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend + of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God. + 5 Or does it seem to YOU that the scripture says to no purpose: “It is with a tendency to envy that the spirit + which has taken up residence within us keeps longing”? 6 However, the undeserved kindness which he gives is greater. + Hence it says: “God opposes the haughty ones, + but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.” + 7 Subject yourselves, + therefore, to God; but oppose * the Devil, + and he will flee from YOU . + 8 Draw close to God, and he will draw close to YOU . + Cleanse YOUR hands, YOU sinners, + and purify YOUR hearts, + YOU indecisive * + ones. 9 Give way to misery and mourn and weep. + Let YOUR laughter be turned into mourning, and [ YOUR ] joy into dejection. + 10 Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, * + and he will exalt YOU . + 11 Quit speaking against one another, brothers. + He who speaks against a brother or judges + his brother speaks against law and judges law. Now if you judge law, you are, not a doer of law, but a judge. + 12 One there is that is lawgiver and judge, + he who is able to save and to destroy. + But you, who are you to be judging [your] neighbor? + 13 Come, now, YOU who say: “Today or tomorrow we will journey to this city and will spend a year there, and we will engage in business and make profits,” + 14 whereas YOU do not know what YOUR life will be tomorrow. + For YOU are a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing. + 15 Instead, YOU ought to say: “If Jehovah * wills, + we shall live and also do this or that.” + 16 But now YOU take pride in YOUR self-assuming brags. + All such taking of pride is wicked. 17 Therefore, if one knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, + it is a sin + for him.
