These you will please * send on their way in a manner worthy of God. + 7 For it was in behalf of [his] * name that they went forth, not taking anything + from the people of the nations. 8 We, therefore, are under obligation to receive such persons hospitably, + that we may become fellow workers in the truth. * + 9 I wrote something to the congregation, but Di·otʹre·phes, who likes to have the first place * + among them, does not receive anything + from us with respect. + 10 That is why, if I come, I will call to remembrance his works which he goes on doing, + chattering about us with wicked words. + Also, not being content * with these things, neither does he himself receive the brothers + with respect, and those who are wanting to receive + them he tries * to hinder + and to throw out + of the congregation. 11 Beloved one, be an imitator, not of what is bad, but of what is good. + He that does good originates with God. + He that does bad has not seen God. + 12 De·meʹtri·us has had witness borne to him by them all + and by the truth itself. In fact, we, also, are bearing witness, + and you know that the witness we give is true. + 13 I had many things to write you, yet I do not wish to go on writing you with ink and pen. * + 14 But I am hoping to see you directly, and we shall speak face to face. * + May you have peace. + The friends send you their greetings. + Give my greetings + to the friends by name.
