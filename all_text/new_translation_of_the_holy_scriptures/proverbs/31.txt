Her clothing is of linen and wool dyed reddish purple. + נ [ Nun ] 23 Her owner + is someone known in the gates, + when he sits down with the older men * of the land. ס [ Saʹmekh ] 24 She has made even undergarments + and proceeded to sell [them], and belts she has given to the tradesmen. ע [ ʽAʹyin ] 25 Strength and splendor are her clothing, + and she laughs at a future day. + פ [ Peʼ ] 26 Her mouth she has opened in wisdom, + and the law of loving-kindness * is upon her tongue. + צ [ Tsa·dhehʹ ] 27 She is watching over the goings-on of her household, and the bread of laziness * she does not eat. + ק [ Qohph ] 28 Her sons have risen up and proceeded to pronounce her happy; + her owner [rises up], and he praises her. + ר [ Rehsh ] 29 There are many daughters + that have shown capableness, but you—you have ascended above them all. + ש [ Shin ] 30 Charm may be false, + and prettiness may be vain; + [but] the woman that fears Jehovah is the one that procures praise for herself. + ת [ Taw ] 31 G IVE her of the fruitage of her hands, + and let her works praise her even in the gates. * + Footnotes ^ Meaning “Belonging to God.” ^ Lit., “O my son .” Heb., ber iʹ (from bar, which is Biblical Aram.). See Ps 2:12 ftn, “Son.” ^ Lit., “all the sons of the passing away.” ^ “Her owner .” Heb., baʽ·l ahʹ . ^ Or, “her bread .” Heb., lach·m ahʹ (from leʹchem, as in vs 27). ^ Lit., “things carried off.” Heb., teʹreph . ^ “Double garments,” by a slight change in vowel pointing, to agree with LXX; M, “scarlet garments.” ^ Or, “elders.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “And the bread of laziness .” Heb., we leʹchem ʽats·luthʹ . ^ Some ed. of the Heb. text display the trigrammaton, or three letters, Chehth, Zaʹyin, Qohph ( ח ז ק ) that stand as King Hezekiah’s signature to the copy-work done by his scribes to signify that the work had been completed.
