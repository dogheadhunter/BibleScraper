Who has uneasiness? Who has contentions? + Who has concern? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has dullness of eyes? 30 Those staying a long time with the wine, + those coming in to search out mixed wine. + 31 Do not look at wine when it exhibits a red color, when it gives off its sparkle in the cup, [when] it goes with a slickness. 32 At its end it bites just like a serpent, + and it secretes poison just like a viper. + 33 Your own eyes will see strange things, * and your own heart will speak perverse things. + 34 And you will certainly become like one lying down in the heart of the sea, even like one lying down at the top of a mast. + 35 “They have struck me, but I did not become sick; they have smitten me, but I did not know it. When shall I wake up? + I shall seek it yet some more.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “soul.” Heb., neʹphesh; Lat., aʹni·mam . ^ Lit., “evil as to eye.” Heb., raʽ ʽaʹyin . ^ “Their Redeemer ( Repurchaser ).” By extension of thought, “their Avenger ( Vindicator ).” Heb., gho·ʼal amʹ .
