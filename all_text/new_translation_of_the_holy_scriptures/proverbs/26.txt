Then there is a proverb in the mouth of stupid people. + 8 Like one shutting up a stone in a heap of stones, so is the one giving glory to a mere stupid one. + 9 As a thorny weed has come up into the hand of a drunkard, so a proverb into the mouth of stupid people. + 10 As an archer piercing everything is the one hiring someone stupid + or the one hiring passersby. 11 Just like a dog returning to its vomit, the stupid one is repeating his foolishness. + 12 Have you seen a man wise in his own eyes? + There is more hope for the stupid one + than for him. 13 The lazy one has said: “There is a young lion in the way, a lion in among the public squares.” + 14 A door keeps turning upon its pivot, and the lazy one upon his couch. + 15 The lazy one has hidden his hand in the banquet bowl; he has become too weary to bring it back to his mouth. + 16 The lazy one is wiser in his own eyes + than seven giving a sensible reply. 17 As one grabbing hold of the ears of a dog is anyone passing by that is becoming furious at the quarrel that is not his. + 18 Just like someone mad that is shooting fiery missiles, + arrows and death, 19 so is the man that has tricked his fellowman and has said: “Was I not having fun?” + 20 Where there is no wood the fire goes out, and where there is no slanderer contention grows still. + 21 As charcoal for the embers and wood for the fire, so is a contentious man for causing a quarrel + to glow. 22 The words of a slanderer are like things to be swallowed greedily, which do go down into the innermost parts of the belly. + 23 As a silver glazing overlaid upon a fragment of earthenware are fervent lips along with a bad heart. + 24 With his lips the hater makes himself unrecognizable, but inside of him he puts deception. + 25 Although he makes his voice gracious, + do not believe in him, + for there are seven detestable things + in his heart. 26 Hatred is covered over by deceit. His badness will be uncovered in the congregation. + 27 He that is excavating a pit will fall into the same, + and he that is rolling away a stone—back to him it will return. + 28 A tongue that is false hates the one crushed by it, + and a flattering mouth * causes an overthrow. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “and a mouth smooth.” Previous Next Print Share Share
