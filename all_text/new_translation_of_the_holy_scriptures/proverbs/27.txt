Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother that is far away. + 11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, + that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me. + 12 The shrewd one that has seen the calamity has concealed himself; + the inexperienced that have passed along have suffered the penalty. + 13 Take one’s garment, in case one has gone surety for a stranger; + and in the instance of a foreign woman, seize from him a pledge. + 14 He that is blessing his fellowman with a loud voice early in the morning, as a malediction it will be accounted on his part. + 15 A leaking roof that drives one away in the day of a steady rain and a contentious wife are comparable. + 16 Anyone sheltering her has sheltered the wind, and oil is what his right hand encounters. * 17 By iron, iron itself is sharpened. So one man * sharpens the face of another. * + 18 He that is safeguarding the fig tree will himself eat its fruit, + and he that is guarding his master * will be honored. + 19 As in water face corresponds with face, so the heart of a man * with [that of] a man. 20 Sheʹol and [the place of] destruction * + themselves do not get satisfied; + neither do the eyes of a man get satisfied. + 21 The refining pot is for silver, + and the furnace is for gold; + and an individual is according to his praise. + 22 Even if you should pound the foolish one fine with a pestle in a mortar, in among cracked grain, his foolishness will not depart from him. + 23 You ought to know positively the appearance of your flock. Set your heart to your droves; + 24 for treasure will not be to time indefinite, + nor a diadem for all generations. 25 The green grass has departed, and the new grass has appeared, and the vegetation of the mountains has been gathered. + 26 The young rams are for your clothing, + and the he-goats are the price of the field. 27 And there is a sufficiency of goats’ milk for your food, for the food of your household, and the means + of life for your girls.
