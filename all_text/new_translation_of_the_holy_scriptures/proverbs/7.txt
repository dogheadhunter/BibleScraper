On the day of the full moon he will come to his house.” 21 She has misled him by the abundance of her persuasiveness. + By the smoothness of her lips she seduces him. + 22 All of a sudden he is going after her, * + like a bull that comes even to the slaughter, and just as if fettered * for the discipline of a foolish man, 23 until an arrow cleaves open his liver, + just as a bird hastens into the trap, + and he has not known that it involves his very soul. * + 24 And now, O sons, listen to me and pay attention to the sayings of my mouth. + 25 May your heart not turn aside to her ways. Do not wander into her roadways. + 26 For many are the ones she has caused to fall down slain, + and all those being killed by her are numerous. + 27 The ways to Sheʹol * her house + is; they are descending to the interior rooms of death. + Footnotes ^ Or, “lacking good motive.” Heb., chasar-levʹ . ^ “Approach,” by a slight correction; M, “pupil (of the eye),” or, “middle.” ^ Lit., “guarded.” ^ Lit., “the silver.” ^ Or, “with her.” ^ “Fettered,” by a change of vowel pointing; M, “an anklet (fetter).” ^ “That it involves his very soul ( life ).” Heb., ki-ve naph·sh ohʹ huʼ; Gr., psy·khesʹ ; Lat., aʹni·mae .
