Do let us lie in ambush for blood. + Do let us lie in concealment for the innocent men without any cause. + 12 Let us swallow them down alive + just like Sheʹol, * + even whole, like those going down into a pit. + 13 Let us find all sorts of precious valuables. + Let us fill our houses with spoil. + 14 Your lot you ought to cast in among us. Let there come to be just one bag belonging to all of us” + — 15 my son, do not go in the way with them. + Hold back your foot from their roadway. + 16 For their feet are those that run to sheer badness, + and they keep hastening to shed blood. + 17 For it is for nothing that the net is spread before the eyes of anything owning wings. + 18 Consequently they themselves lie in ambush for the very blood of these; + they lie in concealment for their souls. * + 19 Thus are the paths of everyone making unjust profit. + It takes away the very soul of its owners. + 20 True wisdom + itself * keeps crying aloud in the very street. + In the public squares it keeps giving forth its voice. + 21 At the upper end of the noisy streets * it calls out. + At the entrances of the gates into the city it says its own sayings: + 22 “How long will YOU inexperienced ones keep loving inexperience, + and [how long] must YOU ridiculers desire for yourselves outright ridicule, + and [how long] will YOU stupid ones keep hating knowledge? + 23 Turn back at my reproof. + Then to YOU I will cause my spirit to bubble forth; + I will make my words known to YOU . + 24 Because I have called out but YOU keep refusing, + I have stretched out my hand but there is no one paying attention, + 25 and YOU keep neglecting all my counsel, + and my reproof YOU have not accepted, + 26 I also, for my part, shall laugh at YOUR own disaster, + I shall mock when what YOU dread comes, + 27 when what YOU dread comes just like a storm, and YOUR own disaster gets here just like a storm wind, + when distress and hard times come upon YOU . + 28 At that time they will keep calling me, but I shall not answer; + they will keep looking for me, but they will not find me, + 29 for the reason that they hated knowledge, + and the fear of Jehovah they did not choose. + 30 They did not consent to my counsel; + they disrespected all my reproof. + 31 So they will eat from the fruitage of their way, + and they will be glutted with their own counsels. + 32 For the renegading + of the inexperienced ones is what will kill them, + and the easygoingness of the stupid is what will destroy them. + 33 As for the one listening to me, he will reside in security + and be undisturbed from dread of calamity.” + Footnotes ^ “Just like Sheol .” Heb., ki sh·ʼohlʹ ; Gr., haiʹdes ; Syr., shiul ; Lat., in·ferʹnus .
