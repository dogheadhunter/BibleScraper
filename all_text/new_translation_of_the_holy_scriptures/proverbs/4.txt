Love it, and it will safeguard you. 7 Wisdom is the prime thing. + Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding. + 8 Highly esteem it, and it will exalt you. + It will glorify you because you embrace it. + 9 To your head it will give a wreath of charm; + a crown of beauty it will bestow upon you.” + 10 Hear, my son, and accept my sayings. + Then for you the years of life will become many. * + 11 I will instruct you even in the way of wisdom; + I will cause you to tread in the tracks of uprightness. + 12 When you walk, your pace will not be cramped; + and if you run, you will not stumble. + 13 Take hold on discipline; + do not let go. * + Safeguard it, * for it itself is your life. + 14 Into the path of the wicked ones do not enter, + and do not walk straight on into the way of the bad ones. + 15 Shun it, + do not pass along by it; + turn aside from it, and pass along. + 16 For they do not sleep unless they do badness, + and their sleep has been snatched away unless they cause someone to stumble. + 17 For they have fed themselves with the bread of wickedness, + and the wine of acts of violence is what they drink. + 18 But the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established. + 19 The way of the wicked ones is like the gloom; + they have not known at what they keep stumbling. + 20 My son, to my words do pay attention. + To my sayings incline your ear. + 21 May they not get away from your eyes. + Keep them in the midst of your heart. + 22 For they are life to those finding them + and health to all their flesh. + 23 More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, + for out of it are the sources of life. + 24 Remove from yourself the crookedness of speech; * + and the deviousness of lips put far away from yourself. + 25 As for your eyes, straight ahead they should look, + yes, your own beaming eyes should gaze straight in front of you. + 26 Smooth out the course of your foot, * + and may all your own ways be firmly established. + 27 Do not incline to the right hand or to the left. + Remove your foot from what is bad. + Footnotes ^ Or, “her,” referring to “wisdom.” ^ Or, “And they [the sayings of mine] will become many for you during the years of life.” ^ Or, “her.” See vs 6 ftn. ^ Or, “do not let [it] alone.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ “Make straight paths for your feet,” LXX.
