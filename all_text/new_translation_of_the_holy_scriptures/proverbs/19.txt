He that is guarding discernment is going to find good. + 9 The false witness will not be free from punishment, + and he that launches forth lies will perish. + 10 Luxury is not fitting for anyone stupid. + How much less for a servant to rule over princes! + 11 The insight of a man * certainly slows down his anger, + and it is beauty on his part to pass over transgression. + 12 The raging of a king is a growling like that of a maned young lion, + but his goodwill is like the dew upon the vegetation. + 13 A stupid son means adversities to his father, + and the contentions of a wife are as a leaking roof that drives one away. + 14 The inheritance from fathers is a house and wealth, + but a discreet wife is from Jehovah. + 15 Laziness causes a deep sleep to fall, + and a slack soul goes hungry. + 16 He that is keeping the commandment is keeping his soul; + he that is despising his ways will be put to death. + 17 He that is showing favor to the lowly one is lending to Jehovah, + and his treatment He will repay to him. + 18 Chastise your son while there exists hope; + and to the putting of him to death do not lift up your soul[ful desire]. + 19 He that is of great rage will be bearing the fine; + for if you would deliver [him], you will also keep doing it again and again. + 20 Listen to counsel and accept discipline, + in order that you may become wise in your future. + 21 Many are the plans in the heart of a man, * + but the counsel of Jehovah is what will stand. + 22 The desirable thing in earthling man * is his loving-kindness; + and one of little means is better than a lying man. + 23 The fear of Jehovah tends toward life, + and one will spend the night satisfied; + one will not be visited with what is bad. + 24 The lazy one has hidden his hand in the banquet bowl; + he cannot bring it back even to his own mouth. + 25 The ridiculer you should strike, + that the inexperienced one may become shrewd; + and there should be a reproving of the understanding one, that he may discern knowledge. + 26 He that is maltreating a father [and] that chases a mother away + is a son acting shamefully and disgracefully. + 27 Cease, my son, to listen to discipline [and it will mean] to stray from the sayings of knowledge. + 28 A good-for-nothing witness * derides justice, + and the very mouth of wicked people swallows down what is hurtful. + 29 Judgments have been firmly established for ridiculers, + and strokes for the back of stupid ones. + Footnotes ^ “Lips,” MVg; TSy and about 50 Heb. mss, “ways.” ^ Or, “missing the mark.” See Ro 3:23 . ^ Or, “He that is acquiring good motive .” Heb., qo·neh- levʹ . ^ Or, “The insight of an earthling man.” Heb., seʹkhel ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “In the heart of a man .” Heb., be lev-ʼishʹ . ^ “The desirable thing in earthling man.” Heb., ta·ʼawathʹ ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Lit., “A witness of belial.” Heb., ʽedh beli·yaʹʽal .
