Then dishonor will come; + but wisdom is with the modest ones. + 3 The integrity of the upright ones is what leads them, + but distortion by those dealing treacherously will despoil them. * + 4 Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, + but righteousness itself will deliver from death. + 5 The righteousness of the blameless one is what will make his way straight, + but in his own wickedness the wicked one will fall. + 6 The righteousness of the upright ones is what will deliver them, + but by their * craving * those dealing treacherously will themselves be caught. + 7 When a wicked man * dies, [his] hope perishes; + and even expectation [based] on powerfulness has perished. + 8 The righteous is the one rescued even from distress, + and the wicked one comes in instead of him. + 9 By [his] mouth the one who is an apostate brings his fellowman to ruin, + but by knowledge are the righteous rescued. + 10 Because of the goodness of the righteous ones a town is elated, + but when the wicked ones perish there is a joyful cry. + 11 Because of the blessing of the upright ones a town is exalted, + but because of the mouth of the wicked ones it gets torn down. + 12 The one in want of heart * has despised his own fellowman, + but the man * of broad discernment is one that keeps silent. + 13 The one walking about as a slanderer + is uncovering confidential talk, + but the one faithful in spirit * is covering over a matter. + 14 When there is no skillful direction, the people fall; + but there is salvation in the multitude of counselors. + 15 One will positively fare badly because he has gone surety for a stranger, + but the one hating handshaking is keeping carefree. 16 A woman of charm is the one that takes hold of glory; * + but the tyrants, for their part, take hold of riches. 17 A man of loving-kindness * is dealing rewardingly with his own soul, + but the cruel person is bringing ostracism upon his own organism. + 18 The wicked one is making false wages, * + but the one sowing righteousness, true earnings. * + 19 The one firmly standing for righteousness * is in line for life, + but the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death. + 20 Those crooked at heart are something detestable to Jehovah, + but the ones blameless in [their] way are a pleasure to him. + 21 Though hand be to hand, a bad person will not go unpunished; + but the offspring of the righteous ones will certainly escape. + 22 As a gold nose ring in the snout of a pig, so is a woman that is pretty but that is turning away from sensibleness. * + 23 The desire of the righteous ones is surely good; + the hope of the wicked ones is fury. + 24 There exists the one that is scattering and yet is being increased; + also the one that is keeping back from what is right, but it results only in want. + 25 The generous soul * will itself be made fat, + and the one freely watering [others] will himself also be freely watered. + 26 The one holding back grain—the populace will execrate him, but there is a blessing for the head of the one letting it be bought. + 27 He that is looking for good will keep seeking goodwill; + but as for the one searching for bad, it will come upon him. + 28 The one trusting in his riches—he himself will fall; + but just like foliage the righteous ones will flourish. + 29 As for anyone bringing ostracism upon his own house, + he will take possession of wind; + and a foolish person will be a servant to the one wise in heart. 30 The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life, + and he that is winning souls is wise. + 31 Look! The righteous one—in the earth he will be rewarded. + How much more should the wicked one and the sinner be! + Footnotes ^ “Will despoil them,” according to M margin Vg. ^ “Their,” TLXXSyVg; M omits. ^ “Destruction,” LXX. ^ Or, “earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ “But the man of.” Heb., we ʼishʹ . ^ Or, “lacking good motive.” Heb., chasar-levʹ . ^ “Spirit.” Heb., ruʹach; Gr., pno·eiʹ, “breath”; Lat., aʹni·mi . ^ Or, “honor.” ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ “ False wages,” that is, the reward for bad activity.
