O Caʹnaan, the land of the Phi·lisʹtines, I will also destroy you, so that there will be no inhabitant. + 6 And the region of the sea must become pasture grounds, + [with] wells for shepherds and stone pens for sheep. 7 And it must become a region for the remaining ones of the house of Judah. + Upon them they will feed. In the houses of Ashʹke·lon, in the evening, they will lie stretched out. For Jehovah their God * will turn his attention to them + and certainly gather back the captive ones of them.” + 8 “I have heard the reproach by Moʹab + and the abusive words of the sons of Amʹmon, + with which they have reproached my people and kept putting on great airs against their territory. 9 Therefore, as I am alive,” + is the utterance of Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, “Moʹab herself will become just like Sodʹom, + and the sons of Amʹmon + like Go·morʹrah, a place possessed by nettles, and a salt pit, and a desolate waste, even to time indefinite. + The remaining ones of my people will plunder them, and the remnant of my own nation will take possession of them. + 10 This is what they will have instead of their pride, + because they reproached and kept putting on great airs against the people of Jehovah * of armies. + 11 Jehovah will be fear-inspiring against them; * + for he will certainly emaciate all the gods of the earth, * + and people will bow down to him, + each one from his place, all the islands * of the nations. + 12 “Y OU also, YOU E·thi·oʹpi·ans, * + YOU yourselves will be people slain by my sword. * + 13 “And he will stretch out his hand toward the north, and he will destroy As·syrʹi·a. + And he will make Ninʹe·veh a desolate waste, + a waterless region like the wilderness. 14 And in the midst of her, droves will certainly lie stretched out, all the wild animals of a nation. * + Both pelican and porcupine + will spend the night right among her pillar capitals. + A voice will keep singing in the window. There will be devastation at the threshold; for he will certainly lay bare the very wainscoting. + 15 This is the exultant city that was sitting in security, + that was saying in her heart, ‘I am, and there is nobody else.’ + O how she has become an object of astonishment, a place for the wild animals to lie stretched out! Everyone passing along by her will whistle; he will wag his hand.” + Footnotes ^ Or, “not yearning intensely.” ^ “You may be concealed ( sheltered ).” Heb., tis· sa·ther uʹ; not tsa·phanʹ, as in the name Zephaniah.
