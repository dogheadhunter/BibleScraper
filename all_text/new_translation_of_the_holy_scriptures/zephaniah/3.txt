I devastated their streets, so that there was no one passing through. Their cities were laid waste, so that there was no man, * so that there was no inhabitant. + 7 I said, ‘Surely you will fear me; you will accept discipline’; + so that her dwelling might not be cut off + —all that I must call to account against her. + Truly they acted promptly in making all their dealings ruinous. + 8 “‘Therefore keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ + is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘till the day of my rising up * to [the] booty, * + for my judicial decision is to gather nations, + for me to collect together kingdoms, in order to pour out upon them my denunciation, + all my burning anger; for by the fire of my zeal all the earth * will be devoured. + 9 For then I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language, * + in order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, + in order to serve him shoulder to shoulder.’ * + 10 “From the region of the rivers of E·thi·oʹpi·a * the ones entreating me, [namely,] the daughter of my scattered ones, will bring a gift to me. + 11 In that day you * will not be ashamed because of all your dealings with which you transgressed against me, + for then I shall remove from the midst of you your haughtily exultant ones; + and you will never again be haughty in my holy mountain. + 12 And I shall certainly let remain in the midst of you a people humble and lowly, + and they will actually take refuge in the name of Jehovah. + 13 As regards the remaining ones of Israel, + they will do no unrighteousness, + nor speak a lie, + nor will there be found in their mouths a tricky tongue; + for they themselves will feed and actually lie stretched out, + and there will be no one making [them] tremble.” + 14 Joyfully cry out, O daughter of Zion! Break out in cheers, + O Israel! Rejoice and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! + 15 Jehovah has removed the judgments upon you. + He has turned away your enemy. + The king of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of you. + You will fear calamity no more. + 16 In that day it will be said to Jerusalem: “Do not be afraid, O Zion. + May your hands not drop down. + 17 Jehovah your God * is in the midst of you. As a mighty One, * he will save. + He will exult over you with rejoicing. + He will become silent in his love. He will be joyful over you with happy cries. 18 “The ones grief-stricken + in absence from [your] festal season I shall certainly gather together; + absent from you * they happened to be, because of bearing reproach on her account. + 19 Here I am acting against all those afflicting you, at that time; + and I will save her that is limping, + and her that is dispersed I shall collect together. + And I will set them as a praise and as a name in all the land of their shame. 20 At that time I shall bring YOU people in, even in the time of my collecting YOU together. For I shall make YOU people to be a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I gather back YOUR captive ones before YOUR eyes,” Jehovah has said. + Footnotes ^ Or, “that is dirty.” ^ “Her God .” Heb., ʼElo·h eyʹha; Gr., The·onʹ . ^ “Man.” Heb., ʼish . ^ “My rising up .” Heb., qu·m iʹ; LXX(Gr., a·na·staʹse·osʹ mou )Vg(Lat., re·sur·rec·ti·oʹnis meʹae ), “my resurrection .” See Mt 22:23 ftn. ^ “To [the] booty .” Heb., le ʽadhʹ ; LXXSy and by a different vowel pointing, “to a witness (testimony)”; Lat., in fu·tuʹrum, “in the future.” ^ Or, “the land .” Heb., ha· ʼaʹrets . ^ Lit., “[with] one shoulder.” ^ Lit., “a clean lip .” Heb., sa·phahʹ veru·rahʹ .
