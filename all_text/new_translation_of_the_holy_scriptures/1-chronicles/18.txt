With it Solʹo·mon made the copper sea + and the pillars + and the copper utensils. + 9 When Toʹu * the king of Haʹmath + heard that David had struck down all the military force of Had·ad·eʹzer + the king of Zoʹbah, 10 he immediately sent Ha·doʹram + his son to King David to ask him about his welfare and congratulate * him over the fact that he had fought against Had·ad·eʹzer so that he struck him down, (for Had·ad·eʹzer had become trained in warfare against Toʹu, * ) and [there were with him] all sorts of articles of gold and silver + and copper. 11 These also King David sanctified + to Jehovah together with the silver and the gold that he had carried off from all the nations, + from Eʹdom and from Moʹab + and from the sons of Amʹmon + and from the Phi·lisʹtines + and from Amʹa·lek. + 12 As for A·bishʹai + the son of Ze·ruʹiah, + he struck down the Eʹdom·ites in the Valley of Salt, + eighteen thousand. 13 So he put garrisons in Eʹdom, and all the Eʹdom·ites came to be David’s servants. + And Jehovah kept saving David wherever he went. + 14 And David continued to reign over all Israel, + and he was continually rendering judicial decision and righteousness for all his people. + 15 And Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah was over the army, + and Je·hoshʹa·phat + the son of A·hiʹlud was recorder. * 16 And Zaʹdok + the son of A·hiʹtub and A·himʹe·lech * + the son of A·biʹa·thar were priests, and Shavʹsha + was secretary. 17 And Be·naiʹah + the son of Je·hoiʹa·da + was over the Cherʹe·thites + and the Pelʹe·thites; + and the sons of David were the first in position at the side of the king. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “and her daughters.” ^ Lit., “gift.” ^ Lit., “his hand.” ^ Possibly, “teams.” ^ Or, “the Syrians.” ^ “Put garrisons,” TLXXVg, one Heb. ms and 2Sa 8:6 . ^ “Tou,” MVg; in 2Sa 8:9, 10 , “Toi.” ^ Lit., “bless.” ^ Lit., “become a man of wars of Tou.” ^ Lit., “remembrancer.” ^ “Ahimelech,” LXXSyVg, 12 Heb. mss and 2Sa 8:17 ; MLXX א , “Abimelech.” Previous Next Print Share Share
