And the spoil of the city that he brought out was very much. + 3 And the people that were in it he brought out, and he kept them employed + at sawing stones and at sharp instruments of iron and at axes; * + and that was the way David proceeded to do to all the cities of the sons of Amʹmon. Finally David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 4 And it came about after this that war began breaking out at Geʹzer + with the Phi·lisʹtines. + It was then that Sibʹbe·cai + the Huʹshath·ite struck down Sipʹpai * of those born of the Rephʹa·im, * + so that they were subdued. 5 And there came to be war again with the Phi·lisʹtines; and El·haʹnan + the son of Jaʹir got to strike down Lahʹmi the brother of Go·liʹath + the Gitʹtite, * the shaft of whose spear was like the beam of loom workers. + 6 And there came to be war again at Gath, + when there happened to be a man of extraordinary size + whose fingers and toes were in sixes, twenty-four; + and he, too, had been born to the Rephʹa·im. * + 7 And he kept taunting + Israel. Finally Jonʹa·than * the son of Shimʹe·a + the brother of David struck him down. 8 These were the ones that had been born to the Rephʹa·im + in Gath; + and they came to fall + by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.
