Sanctify + yourselves, YOU and YOUR brothers, and YOU must bring the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel up to the place that * I have prepared for it. 13 Because at the first time YOU did not, + Jehovah our God broke through against us, + for we did not search after him according to the custom.” + 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified + themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel. 15 Then the sons of the Levites began to carry + the ark of the [true] God, just as Moses had commanded by Jehovah’s word, upon their shoulders with the rods upon them. + 16 David now said to the chiefs of the Levites to station their brothers the singers + with the instruments of song, + stringed instruments + and harps + and cymbals, + playing aloud to cause a sound of rejoicing to arise. 17 Accordingly the Levites stationed Heʹman + the son of Joel and, of his brothers, Aʹsaph + the son of Ber·e·chiʹah; and, of the sons of Me·rarʹi their brothers, Eʹthan + the son of Kush·aʹiah; 18 and with them their brothers of the second division, + Zech·a·riʹah, + Ben and Ja·aʹzi·el and She·mirʹa·moth and Je·hiʹel and Unʹni, E·liʹab and Be·naiʹah and Ma·a·seiʹah and Mat·ti·thiʹah and E·liphʹe·le·hu and Mik·neʹiah, and Oʹbed-eʹdom + and Je·iʹel the gatekeepers, 19 and the singers Heʹman, + Aʹsaph + and Eʹthan, with the copper cymbals to play aloud; + 20 and Zech·a·riʹah and Aʹzi·el + and She·mirʹa·moth and Je·hiʹel and Unʹni and E·liʹab and Ma·a·seiʹah and Be·naiʹah with stringed instruments tuned to Alʹa·moth, * + 21 and Mat·ti·thiʹah + and E·liphʹe·le·hu and Mik·neʹiah and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·iʹel and Az·a·ziʹah with harps + tuned to Shemʹi·nith, * + to act as directors; 22 and Chen·a·niʹah + the chief of the Levites in carrying, he giving instruction * in carrying, for he was expert; + 23 and Ber·e·chiʹah and El·kaʹnah the gatekeepers + for the Ark; 24 and Sheb·a·niʹah and Joshʹa·phat and Ne·thanʹel and A·maʹsai and Zech·a·riʹah and Be·naiʹah and E·li·eʹzer the priests loudly sounding the trumpets + before the ark of the [true] God, and Oʹbed-eʹdom and Je·hiʹah the gatekeepers for the Ark. 25 And David + and the older men of Israel + and the chiefs + of the thousands came to be the ones walking along to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah from the house of Oʹbed-eʹdom + with rejoicing. + 26 And it came about when the [true] God helped + the Levites while carrying the ark of the covenant of Jehovah that they proceeded to sacrifice seven young bulls and seven rams. + 27 And David was dressed in a sleeveless coat of fine fabric, and also all the Levites carrying the Ark and the singers and Chen·a·niʹah + the chief of the carrying by the singers; + but upon David there was an ephʹod + of linen. 28 And all the Israelites were bringing up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with joyful shouting + and with the sounding of the horn + and with trumpets + and with cymbals, + playing aloud on stringed instruments and harps. + 29 And it came about that, when the ark of the covenant + of Jehovah came as far as the City of David, Miʹchal, + Saul’s daughter, herself looked down through the window and got to see King David skipping about and celebrating; + and she began to despise + him in her heart.
