Shimʹri was the head, for he did not happen to be the firstborn + but his father appointed him as head; + 11 Hil·kiʹah the second, Teb·a·liʹah the third, Zech·a·riʹah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hoʹsah were thirteen. 12 Of these divisions of the gatekeepers, the headmen had duties exactly as their brothers did, + to minister at the house of Jehovah. 13 So they cast lots + for the small the same as for the great by their paternal houses, + for the different gates. 14 Then the lot to the east fell to Shel·e·miʹah. + For Zech·a·riʹah + his son, a counselor + with discretion, they cast the lots, and his lot got to come out to the north. + 15 Oʹbed-eʹdom had his to the south, and his sons + had the storehouses. + 16 Shupʹpim and Hoʹsah + had theirs to the west close by the Gate Shalʹlech·eth by the highway that goes up, guard group + corresponding with guard group; + 17 to the east there were six Levites; to the north for a day, four; to the south for a day, + four; and for the stores, + two by two; 18 for the portico to the west, four at the highway, + two at the portico. 19 These were the divisions of the gatekeepers of the sons of the Koʹrah·ites + and of the sons of Me·rarʹi. + 20 As regards the Levites, A·hiʹjah was over the treasures + of the house of the [true] God and over the treasures of the things made holy. + 21 The sons of Laʹdan, + the sons of the Gerʹshon·ite belonging to Laʹdan; the heads of the paternal houses belonging to Laʹdan the Gerʹshon·ite, Je·hiʹe·li. + 22 The sons of Je·hiʹe·li, Zeʹtham and Joel + his brother, were over the treasures + of the house of Jehovah. 23 For the Amʹram·ites, for the Izʹhar·ites, for the Heʹbron·ites, for the Uz·ziʹel·ites, + 24 even Shebʹu·el * + the son of Gerʹshom the son of Moses was a leader over the stores. 25 As regards his brothers, of E·li·eʹzer + there was Re·ha·biʹah + his son and Je·shaʹiah his son and Joʹram his son and Zichʹri his son and She·loʹmoth his son. 26 This She·loʹmoth and his brothers were over all the treasures of the things made holy, + that David + the king and the heads of the paternal houses, + and the chiefs of the thousands and of the hundreds, and the chiefs of the army had made holy. 27 From the wars + and from the spoil + they had made [things] holy to maintain the house of Jehovah. 28 And also all that Samuel the seer + and Saul the son of Kish and Abʹner + the son of Ner and Joʹab + the son of Ze·ruʹiah + had made holy. What anyone made holy * was under the control of She·loʹmith * and his brothers. 29 Of the Izʹhar·ites, + Chen·a·niʹah and his sons were for the outside + business as officers and as judges + over Israel. 30 Of the Heʹbron·ites, + Hash·a·biʹah and his brothers, capable men, + a thousand seven hundred, were over the administration of Israel in the region of the Jordan to the west for all the work of Jehovah and for the king’s service. 31 Of the Heʹbron·ites, Je·riʹjah + was the head of the Heʹbron·ites by its generations by forefathers. In the fortieth + year of David’s kingship they were sought out, and valiant, mighty men came to be found among them in Jaʹzer + in Gilʹe·ad. + 32 And his brothers, capable men, + were two thousand seven hundred, heads of the paternal houses. + So David the king assigned them over the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites and the half tribe of the Ma·nasʹsites, + for every matter of the [true] God and matter + of the king.
