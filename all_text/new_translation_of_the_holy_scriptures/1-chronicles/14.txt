At that David said: “The [true] God has broken through my enemies by my hand like a gap made by waters.” That is why they called the name of that place + Baʹal-pe·raʹzim. 12 Consequently they left their gods * there. + Then David said [the word], and so they were burned in the fire. + 13 Later the Phi·lisʹtines once again made a raid in the low plain. + 14 At that David inquired + again of God, and the [true] God now said to him: “You must not go up after them. Go around from directly against them, and you must come at them in front of the baʹca bushes. * + 15 And let it occur that, when you hear the sound of the marching in the tops of the baʹca bushes, + then you go out into the fight, + because the [true] God will have gone out before you + to strike the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines down.” 16 So David did just as the [true] God had commanded him, + and they went striking down the camp of the Phi·lisʹtines from Gibʹe·on + to Geʹzer. + 17 And David’s fame * + began to go out into all the lands, and Jehovah himself put the dread of him upon all the nations. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “in front of them.” Compare Ge 10:9 ftn, “Opposition to.” ^ “Their gods ,” M(Heb., ʼelo·h eh·hemʹ )­LXXVg. ^ “The baca bushes .” Heb., hab· bekha·ʼimʹ ; LXXVg, “pear trees.” ^ Lit., “name.” Previous Next Print Share Share
