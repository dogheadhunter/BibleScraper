And the sayings are of old tradition. + 23 They were the potters + and the inhabitants of Ne·taʹim and Ge·deʹrah. It was with the king in his work that they dwelt there. + 24 The sons of Simʹe·on were Nemʹu·el + and Jaʹmin, + Jaʹrib, Zeʹrah, Shaʹul, + 25 Shalʹlum his son, Mibʹsam his son, Mishʹma his son. 26 And the sons of Mishʹma were Hamʹmu·el his son, Zacʹcur his son, Shimʹe·i his son. 27 And Shimʹe·i had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his brothers did not have many sons, and none of their families had as many as the sons of Judah. + 28 And they continued to dwell in Beʹer-sheʹba + and Mo·laʹdah + and Haʹzar-shuʹal + 29 and in Bilʹhah + and in Eʹzem + and in Toʹlad + 30 and in Be·thuʹel + and in Horʹmah + and in Zikʹlag + 31 and in Beth-marʹca·both and in Haʹzar-suʹsim + and in Beth-birʹi and in Shaʹa·raʹim. + These were their cities down till David reigned. 32 And their settlements were Eʹtam and Aʹin, Rimʹmon and Toʹchen and Aʹshan, + five cities. 33 And all their settlements that were all around these cities were as far as Baʹal. + These were their dwelling places and their genealogical enrollments for them. 34 And Me·shoʹbab and Jamʹlech and Joʹshah the son of Am·a·ziʹah, 35 and Joel and Jeʹhu the son of Josh·i·biʹah the son of Se·raiʹah the son of Asʹi·el, 36 and Eli·o·eʹnai and Ja·a·koʹbah and Jesh·o·haiʹah and A·saiʹah and Adʹi·el and Je·simʹi·el and Be·naiʹah, 37 and Ziʹza the son of Shiʹphi the son of Alʹlon the son of Je·daʹiah the son of Shimʹri the son of She·maiʹah. 38 These who came in by names were the chieftains among their families, + and the household itself of their forefathers increased in multitude. 39 And they proceeded to go to the entryway of Geʹdor, clear to the east of the valley, to look for pasturage for their flocks. 40 Eventually they found fat and good pasturage, + and the land was quite wide * and having no disturbance + but at ease; for those dwelling there in former times were of Ham. + 41 And these written down by [their] names proceeded to come in in the days of Hez·e·kiʹah * + the king of Judah and strike + down the tents of the Hamʹites * and the Me·uʹnim that were to be found there, so that they devoted them to destruction + down to this day; and they began to dwell in their place, because there was pasturage + for their flocks there. 42 And from them there were some of the sons of Simʹe·on that went to Mount Seʹir, + five hundred men, with Pel·a·tiʹah and Ne·a·riʹah and Re·phaʹiah and Uzʹzi·el the sons of Ishʹi at their head. 43 And they proceeded to strike down the remnant that had escaped of Amʹa·lek, + and they continued to dwell there down to this day.
