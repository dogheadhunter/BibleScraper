The least one was equal to a hundred, and the greatest to a thousand. + 15 These are the ones that crossed the Jordan + in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, + and they then chased away all those of the low plains, to the east and to the west. 16 And some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah proceeded to come clear to the place difficult to approach, + to David. 17 Then David went out before them and answered and said to them: “If it is for peace + that YOU have come to me to help me, my own heart will become at unity with YOU . + But if it is to betray me to my adversaries when there is no wrong on my palms, + let the God + of our forefathers see to it and set it in order.” + 18 And spirit + itself enveloped * A·maʹsai, the head of the thirty: “Yours [we are], O David, and with you [we are], + O son of Jesʹse. Peace, peace be yours, and peace to the one helping you, For your God has helped you.” + So David received them and put them among the heads of the troops. + 19 And there were some of Ma·nasʹseh that deserted * to David when he came with the Phi·lisʹtines + against Saul for battle; but he * did not help them, for on counsel the axis + lords of the Phi·lisʹtines sent him away, saying: “At the risk of our own heads he will desert to his lord * Saul.” + 20 When he came to Zikʹlag + there deserted to him from Ma·nasʹseh Adʹnah and Joʹza·bad and Je·diʹa·el and Miʹcha·el and Joʹza·bad and E·liʹhu and Zilʹle·thai, heads + of the thousands that belonged to Ma·nasʹseh. 21 And they, for their part, were of help to David against the marauder band, + because all of them were mighty men + of valor, and they came to be chiefs in the army; 22 for day by day people kept coming + to David to help him, until it was a great + camp, like the camp of God. + 23 And these were the numbers of the heads of those equipped for the army that came to David at Heʹbron + to turn the kingship + of Saul over to him according to Jehovah’s order. + 24 The sons of Judah carrying the large shield and the lance were six thousand eight hundred, equipped for the army. 25 Of the sons of Simʹe·on the mighty men of valor of the army were seven thousand one hundred. 26 Of the sons of the Levites four thousand six hundred. 27 And Je·hoiʹa·da was the leader + [of the sons] * of Aaron, + and with him there were three thousand seven hundred. 28 Also Zaʹdok + a young man, mighty in valor, and the house of his forefathers, twenty-two chiefs. 29 And of the sons of Benjamin, + the brothers of Saul, + there were three thousand, and up till then the greater number of them were keeping strict watch of the house of Saul. 30 And of the sons of Eʹphra·im there were twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men + of valor, men of fame, * by the house of their forefathers. 31 And of the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh + there were eighteen thousand that had been designated by name to come to make David king. 32 And of the sons of Isʹsa·char + having a knowledge of how to discern the times + to know what Israel ought to do, + there were two hundred head ones of theirs, and all their brothers were at their orders. 33 Of Zebʹu·lun + those going out to the army, drawing up in battle formation with all the weapons of war, there were fifty thousand, and for flocking together [to David] * they were not of a double heart. 34 And of Naphʹta·li + there were a thousand chiefs, and with them with the large shield and the spear there were thirty-seven thousand. 35 And of the Danʹites those drawing up in battle formation were twenty-eight thousand six hundred. 36 And of Ashʹer + those going out to the army for drawing up in battle formation were forty thousand. 37 And from across the Jordan + of the Reuʹben·ites and the Gadʹites and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh with all the weapons of the military army there were a hundred and twenty thousand. 38 All these were men of war, flocking together in battle line; with a complete heart + they came to Heʹbron to make David king over all Israel; and also all the remainder of Israel were of one heart for making David king. + 39 And they continued there with David three days, eating and drinking, + for their brothers had made preparation for them. 40 And also those near to them, as far as Isʹsa·char + and Zebʹu·lun + and Naphʹta·li, + were bringing food * upon asses + and upon camels and upon mules and upon cattle, eatables of flour, + cakes of pressed figs + and cakes of raisins + and wine + and oil + and cattle + and sheep + in great quantity, for there was rejoicing + in Israel.
