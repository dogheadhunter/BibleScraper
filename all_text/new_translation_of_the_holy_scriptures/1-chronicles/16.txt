Also the productive land * is firmly established: Never will it be made to totter. + 31 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be joyful, + And let them say among the nations, ‘Jehovah himself has become king!’ + 32 Let the sea thunder and also that which fills it, + Let the field exult and all that is in it. + 33 At the same time let the trees of the forest break out joyfully on account of Jehovah, + For he has come to judge the earth. + 34 Give thanks to Jehovah, YOU people, for he is good, + For to time indefinite is his loving-kindness. * + 35 And say, ‘Save us, O God of our salvation, + And collect us together and deliver us from the nations, + To give thanks to your holy name, + to speak exultingly in your praise. + 36 Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel from time indefinite to time indefinite.’” + And all the people proceeded to say, “Amen!” and a praise to Jehovah. * + 37 Then he left there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah Aʹsaph + and his brothers to minister + before the Ark constantly, according to the requirement of each day; + 38 and Oʹbed-eʹdom and his brothers, sixty-eight, and Oʹbed-eʹdom the son of Je·duʹthun and Hoʹsah as gatekeepers; 39 and Zaʹdok + the priest and his brothers the priests before the tabernacle of Jehovah on the high place that was at Gibʹe·on, + 40 to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of burnt offering constantly morning and evening and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah that he laid in command upon Israel; + 41 and with them Heʹman + and Je·duʹthun and the rest of the select men that were designated + by names to thank Jehovah, + because “to time indefinite is his loving-kindness”; + 42 and with them Heʹman + and Je·duʹthun, + to sound forth the trumpets + and cymbals and instruments of the song of the [true] God; and the sons + of Je·duʹthun at the gate. 43 And all the people proceeded to go each one to his own house. + Accordingly David went around to bless his own house.
