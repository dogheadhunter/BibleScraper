And who is there volunteering to fill his hand today [with a gift] for Jehovah?” + 6 And the princes + of the paternal + houses * and the princes + of the tribes of Israel and the chiefs of thousands + and of hundreds + and the chiefs of the business + of the king proceeded to volunteer. 7 Accordingly they gave to the service of the house of the [true] God gold worth five thousand talents * and ten thousand darics * and silver worth ten thousand talents and copper worth eighteen thousand talents and iron worth a hundred thousand talents. + 8 And what stones were found with any persons they gave to the treasure of the house of Jehovah under the control of Je·hiʹel + the Gerʹshon·ite. + 9 And the people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah; + and even David the king himself rejoiced with great joy. + 10 Consequently David blessed + Jehovah before the eyes of all the congregation + and David said: “Blessed may you be, + O Jehovah the God of Israel + our father, from time indefinite even to time indefinite. 11 Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness + and the mightiness + and the beauty + and the excellency + and the dignity; + for everything in the heavens and in the earth is [yours]. + Yours is the kingdom, + O Jehovah, the One also lifting yourself up as head over all. + 12 The riches + and the glory + are on account of you, and you are dominating * + everything; and in your hand there are power + and mightiness, + and in your hand is [ability] to make great + and to give strength to all. + 13 And now, O our God, we are thanking you + and praising + your beauteous + name. 14 “And yet, who am I + and who are my people, that we should retain power to make voluntary offerings like this? + For everything is from you, + and out of your own hand we have given to you. 15 For we are alien residents before you and settlers + the same as all our forefathers. Like a shadow our days are upon the earth + and there is no hope. 16 O Jehovah our God, all this abundance that we have prepared to build for you a house for your holy name, from your hand it is, and to you it all belongs. + 17 And I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, + and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. + I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things, and now your people who are on hand here I have enjoyed seeing make offerings voluntarily to you. 18 O Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel our forefathers, + do keep this to time indefinite as the inclination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, + and direct their heart to you. + 19 And to Solʹo·mon my son give a complete heart + to keep your commandments, + your testimonies * + and your regulations, + and to do everything, and to build the castle + for which I have made preparation.” + 20 And David went on to say to all the congregation: + “Bless, + now, Jehovah YOUR God.” And all the congregation proceeded to bless Jehovah the God of their forefathers and bow low + and prostrate + themselves to Jehovah and to the king. 21 And they continued to sacrifice + sacrifices to Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings + to Jehovah on the day following that day, a thousand young bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand male lambs and their drink offerings, + even sacrifices in great number for all Israel. + 22 And they continued eating and drinking before Jehovah on that day with great rejoicing; + and they proceeded a second time to make Solʹo·mon the son of David king + and to anoint him to Jehovah as leader + and also Zaʹdok + as priest. 23 And Solʹo·mon began to sit upon Jehovah’s throne + as king in place of David his father and to make a success of it, + and all the Israelites were obedient to him. 24 As for all the princes + and the mighty men + and also all the sons of King David, + they submitted themselves to Solʹo·mon the king. * 25 And Jehovah continued to make Solʹo·mon surpassingly great + before the eyes of all Israel and to put upon him such royal dignity as had not come to be upon any king before him over Israel. + 26 As for David the son of Jesʹse, he reigned over all Israel; + 27 and the days that he reigned over Israel were forty years. + In Heʹbron he reigned for seven years, + and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three [years]. + 28 And gradually he died in a good old age, + satisfied with days, riches + and glory; + and Solʹo·mon his son began to reign in place of him. + 29 As for the affairs of David the king, the first ones and the last, there they are written among the words of Samuel the seer * + and among the words of Nathan + the prophet and among the words of Gad + the visionary, * 30 together with all his kingship and his mightiness and the times + that had passed over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the lands. + Footnotes ^ Or, “the temple .” Heb., hab· bi·rahʹ . ^ Lit., “of the fathers.” ^ About $1,926,750,000, with gold at $350 (U.S.) per oz t.
