I sought him, but I did not find him. 3 The watchmen + who were going around in the city found me, ‘The one whom my soul has loved have YOU men seen?’ 4 Hardly had I passed on from them until I found the one whom my soul has loved. I grabbed hold of him, and I would not let go of him, until I had brought him into my mother’s house and into the interior room of her that had been pregnant with me. 5 I have put YOU under oath, + O daughters of Jerusalem, by the female gazelles or by the hinds of the field, + that YOU try not to awaken or arouse love [in me] until it feels inclined.” + 6 “What * is this thing that is coming up from the wilderness like columns of smoke, being perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, + even with every sort of scent powder of a trader?” + 7 “Look! It is his couch, the one belonging to Solʹo·mon. Sixty mighty men * are all around it, from the mighty men of Israel, + 8 all of them in possession of a sword, being taught in warfare, each one with his sword upon his thigh because of dread during the nights.” + 9 “It is the litter that King Solʹo·mon has made for himself from the trees of Lebʹa·non. + 10 Its pillars he has made of silver, its supports of gold. Its seat is of wool dyed reddish purple, its interior being fitted out lovingly * by the daughters of Jerusalem.” 11 “Go out and look, O YOU daughters of Zion, on King Solʹo·mon with the wreath + that his mother + wove for him on the day of his marriage and on the day of the rejoicing of his heart.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Who,” with a fem. predicate. ^ “Mighty men.” Heb., gib·bo·rimʹ . ^ Or, “with ebony,” by a correction of M.
