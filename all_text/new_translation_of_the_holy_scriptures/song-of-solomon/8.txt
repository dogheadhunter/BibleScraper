I would give you a drink of spiced wine, + the fresh juice of pomegranates. 3 His left hand would be under my head; and his right hand—it would embrace me. + 4 “I have put YOU under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, that YOU try not to awaken or arouse love [in me] until it feels inclined.” + 5 “Who is this woman + coming up from the wilderness, + leaning upon her dear one?” + “Under the apple tree I aroused you. * There your mother was in birth pangs with you. There she that was giving birth to you experienced birth pangs. + 6 “Place me as a seal upon your * heart, + as a seal upon your arm; because love is as strong as death is, + insistence on exclusive devotion + is as unyielding as Sheʹol * is. Its blazings are the blazings of a fire, the flame of Jah. * + 7 Many waters themselves are not able to extinguish love, + nor can rivers themselves wash it away. + If a man * would give all the valuable things of his house for love, persons would positively despise them.” * 8 “We have a little sister + that does not have any breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day that she will be spoken for?” 9 “If she should be a wall, + we shall build upon her a battlement of silver; but if she should be a door, + we shall block her up with a cedar plank.” 10 “I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. + In this case I have become in his eyes like her that is finding peace. 11 “There was a vineyard + that Solʹo·mon happened to have in Baʹal-haʹmon. He gave the vineyard over to the keepers. + Each one would bring in for its fruitage a thousand silver pieces. * 12 “My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal. * The thousand belong to you, O Solʹo·mon, and two hundred to those keeping its fruitage.” 13 “O you who are dwelling in the gardens, + the partners are paying attention to your * voice. Let me hear it.” + 14 “Run away, my dear one, and make yourself * like a gazelle or like a young one of the stags upon the mountains of spices.” + Footnotes ^ “You,” masc. ^ “Jah.” This is the only place in The Song of Solomon where the divine name occurs, here in abbreviated form.
