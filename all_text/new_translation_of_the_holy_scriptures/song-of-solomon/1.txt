Like an oil that is poured out is your name. + That is why maidens themselves have loved you. 4 Draw me with * you; + let us run. The king has brought me into his interior rooms! + Do let us be joyful and rejoice in you. Do let us mention your expressions of endearment more than wine. + Deservedly they have loved you. + 5 “A black girl I am, but comely, O YOU daughters of Jerusalem, + like the tents of Keʹdar, + [yet] like the tent cloths + of Solʹo·mon. 6 Do not YOU look at me because I am swarthy, because the sun has caught sight of me. The sons of my own mother grew angry with me; they appointed me the keeper of the vineyards, [although] my vineyard, + one that was mine, I did not keep. 7 “Do tell me, O you whom my soul has loved, + where you do shepherding, + where you make the flock lie down at midday. Just why should I become like a woman wrapped in mourning among the droves of your partners?” 8 “If you do not know for yourself, O you most beautiful one among women, + go out yourself in the footprints of the flock and pasture your kids of the goats alongside the tabernacles of the shepherds.” 9 “To a mare of mine in the chariots of Pharʹaoh I have likened you, + O girl companion of mine. + 10 Your cheeks are comely among the hair braids, your neck in a string of beads. + 11 Circlets of gold we shall make for you, + along with studs of silver.” 12 “As long as the king is at his round table my own spikenard + has given out its fragrance. + 13 As a bag of myrrh + my dear one is to me; between my breasts + he will spend the night. 14 As a cluster of henna + my dear one is to me, among the vineyards of En-geʹdi.” + 15 “Look! You are beautiful, O girl companion of mine. + Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are [those of] doves.” + 16 “Look! You are beautiful, * + my dear one, also pleasant. Our divan + also is one of foliage. 17 The beams of our grand house * are cedars, + our rafters juniper trees.
