The curvings of your thighs are like ornaments, + the work of an artisan’s hands. 2 Your navel roll is a round bowl. Let not the mixed wine + be lacking [from it]. Your belly is a heap of wheat, fenced about with lilies. + 3 Your two breasts are like two young ones, the twins of a female gazelle. + 4 Your neck + is like an ivory tower. Your eyes + are like the pools in Heshʹbon, + by the gate of Bath-rabʹbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebʹa·non, which is looking out toward Damascus. 5 Your head upon you is like Carʹmel, + and the tresses + of your head are like wool dyed reddish purple. + The king is held bound by the flowings. + 6 How beautiful you are, and how pleasant you are, O beloved girl, * among exquisite delights! + 7 This stature of yours does resemble a palm tree, + and your breasts, + date clusters. 8 I have said, ‘I shall go up on the palm tree, that I may take hold of its fruit stalks of dates.’ + And, please, may your breasts become like clusters of the vine, and the fragrance of your nose like apples, 9 and your palate like the best wine + that is going with a slickness + for my dear one, softly flowing over the lips of sleeping ones.” 10 “I am my dear one’s, + and toward me is his craving. + 11 Do come, O my dear one, let us go forth to the field; + do let us lodge among the henna + plants. * 12 Do let us rise early and go to the vineyards, that we may see whether the vine has sprouted, + the blossom has burst open, + the pomegranate trees have bloomed. + There I shall give my expressions of endearment to you. + 13 The mandrakes + themselves have given [their] fragrance, and by our entranceways there are all sorts of the choicest fruits. + The new ones as well as the old, O my dear one, I have treasured up for you.
