This one is coming, + climbing upon the mountains, leaping upon the hills. 9 My dear one is resembling a gazelle + or the young of the stags. Look! This one is standing behind our wall, gazing through the windows, glancing through the lattices. + 10 My dear one has answered and said to me, ‘Rise up, you girl companion of mine, my beautiful one, + and come away. + 11 For, look! the rainy season * + itself has passed, the downpour itself is over, it has gone its way. 12 Blossoms themselves have appeared in the land, + the very time of vine trimming + has arrived, and the voice of the turtledove + itself has been heard in our land. 13 As for the fig tree, + it has gained a mature color for its early figs; + and the vines are abloom, they have given [their] fragrance. Rise up, come, O girl companion of mine, + my beautiful one, and come away. 14 O my dove + in the retreats of the crag, in the concealed place of the steep way, show me your form, + let me hear your voice, for your voice is pleasurable and your form is comely.’” + 15 “Do YOU people grab hold of the foxes + for us, the little foxes that are making spoil of the vineyards, as our vineyards are abloom.” + 16 “My dear one is mine and I am his. + He is shepherding + among the lilies. + 17 Until the day breathes and the shadows have fled, turn around, O my dear one; be like the gazelle + or like the young of the stags upon the mountains of separation. * Footnotes ^ “The coastal plain .” Or, “Sharon.” Heb., hash· sha·rohnʹ . ^ Or, “crocus; asphodel.” ^ “Love.” Heb., ʼa·havahʹ . ^ Or, “the winter.” ^ Or, “cleft mountains.” Lit., “mountains of Bether.” The meaning of “Bether” is uncertain.
