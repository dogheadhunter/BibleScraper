You are beautiful, + O girl companion of mine. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are [those of] doves, + behind your veil. + Your hair is like a drove of goats + that have hopped down from the mountainous region of Gilʹe·ad. + 2 Your teeth are like a drove of freshly shorn [ewes] + that have gone up from the washing, all of which are bearing twins, with none among them having lost its young ones. 3 Your lips are just like a scarlet thread, and your speaking is agreeable. + Like a segment of pomegranate are your temples behind your veil. + 4 Your neck + is like the tower + of David, built in courses of stone, upon which are hung a thousand shields, all the circular shields + of the mighty men. * 5 Your two breasts + are like two young ones, the twins of a female gazelle, that are feeding among the lilies.” + 6 “Until the day breathes + and the shadows have fled, I shall go my way to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.” + 7 “You are altogether beautiful, + O girl companion of mine, and there is no defect in you. + 8 With me from Lebʹa·non, O bride, + with me from Lebʹa·non + may you come. May you descend from the top of Anti-Lebʹa·non, * from the top of Seʹnir, + even Herʹmon, + from the lairs of lions, from the mountains of leopards. 9 You have made my heart beat, O my sister, + [my] bride, + you have made my heart beat * by one of your eyes, + by one pendant of your necklace. 10 How beautiful your expressions of endearment are, + O my sister, my bride! How much better your expressions of endearment are than wine and the fragrance of your oils than all sorts of perfume! + 11 With comb honey your lips keep dripping, + O [my] bride. Honey + and milk are under your tongue, and the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance + of Lebʹa·non. 12 A garden barred in is my sister, + [my] bride, a garden * barred in, a spring sealed up. 13 Your skin is a paradise * of pomegranates, * with the choicest fruits, + henna plants along with spikenard + plants; 14 spikenard + and saffron, + cane + and cinnamon, + along with all sorts of trees of frankincense, myrrh and aloes, + along with all the finest perfumes; + 15 [and] a spring of gardens, a well of fresh water, * + and trickling streams from Lebʹa·non. + 16 Awake, O north wind, and come in, O south wind. + Breathe upon my garden. + Let its perfumes trickle.” “Let my dear one come into his garden and eat its choicest fruits.” Footnotes ^ “The mighty men .” Heb., hag· gib·boh·rimʹ . ^ Lit., “Amanah.” ^ Or, “you have encouraged me.” ^ “Garden,” LXXSyVg and many Heb. mss; M, “wave.” ^ Lit., “pomegranate trees.” ^ Lit., “park [preserve].” Heb., par·desʹ; LXXVg, “paradise”; Syr., par·dai·saʼ . ^ Lit., “ living waters.” Heb., maʹyim chai·yimʹ .
