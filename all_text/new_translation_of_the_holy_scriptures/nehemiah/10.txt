and the Levites themselves should offer up a tenth of the tenth to the house of our God + to the dining halls + of the supply house. 39 For it is to the dining halls that the sons of Israel and the sons of the Levites should bring the contribution + of the grain, the new wine + and the oil, and there is where the utensils of the sanctuary and the priests that were ministering, + and the gatekeepers + and the singers + are; and we should not neglect the house of our God. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “And upon the ones sealed.” ^ “Adonikam” in Ezr 2:13 . ^ “Jorah” in Ezr 2:18 . ^ Or, “the temple slaves.” Lit., “the given ones.” Compare Nu 3:9 ftn. ^ A shekel weighed 11.4 g (0.367 oz t).
