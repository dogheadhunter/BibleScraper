Yet YOU are adding to the burning anger against Israel by profaning the sabbath.” + 19 And it came about that, as soon as the gates * of Jerusalem had grown shadowy before the sabbath, I immediately said [the word] and the doors began to be closed. + I said further that they should not open them until after the sabbath; and some of my own attendants I stationed at the gates that no burden might come in on the sabbath day. + 20 Consequently the traders and the sellers of every sort of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once and a second time. 21 Then I proceeded to bear witness + against them and say to them: “Why are YOU spending the night in front of the wall? If YOU do it again, a hand I shall lay on YOU .” + From that time on they did not come on the sabbath. 22 And I went on to say to the Levites + that they should be regularly purifying + themselves and coming in, keeping guard of the gates + to sanctify * + the sabbath day. This, also, do remember + to my account, O my God, and do feel sorry for me according to the abundance of your loving-kindness. + 23 Also, in those days I saw the Jews that had given a dwelling + to Ashʹdod·ite, + Amʹmon·ite [and] Moʹab·ite + wives. 24 And as for their sons, half were speaking Ashʹdod·ite, and there were none of them knowing how to speak Jewish, + but in the tongue of the different peoples. 25 And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them + and strike some men of them + and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: + “Y OU should not give YOUR daughters to their sons, and YOU should not accept any of their daughters for YOUR sons or yourselves. + 26 Was it not because of these that Solʹo·mon the king of Israel sinned? + And among the many nations there proved to be no king like him; + and loved of his God he happened to be, + so that God constituted him king over all Israel. Even him the foreign wives caused to sin. + 27 And is it not something unheard of for YOU to commit all this great badness in acting unfaithfully against our God by giving a dwelling to foreign wives?” + 28 And one of the sons of Joiʹa·da + the son of E·liʹa·shib + the high priest was a son-in-law of San·balʹlat + the Horʹo·nite. + So I chased him away from me. + 29 Do remember them, O my God, on account of the defilement + of the priesthood and the covenant * + of the priesthood * and of the Levites. + 30 And I purified + them from everything foreign and proceeded to assign duties to the priests and to the Levites, each one in his own work, + 31 even for the supply * of the wood + at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits. Do remember me, + O my God, for good. + Footnotes ^ “Into the congregation of.” Heb., bi q·halʹ ; Gr., ek·kle·siʹai ; Lat., ec·cleʹsi·am . ^ Or, “tithe.” ^ Lit., “the oil, the commandment of the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers.” ^ “Babylon,” LXXVg; MSy, “Babel.” ^ Lit., “and at the end of days.” ^ “Then I put . . . in charge,” LXX L Sy. ^ Or, “acts of loyal love.” ^ Lit., “it,” fem., referring to Jerusalem. ^ Nehemiah completes the evidence that the literal city of Jerusalem had 12 gates, even as the heavenly holy city described by John the apostle has 12 gates​—⁠three facing each of the four directions​—⁠as recorded in Re 21:12, 13 .
