We have sinned, both I and the house of my father. + 7 We have unquestionably acted corruptly against you + and have not kept the commandments + and the regulations + and the judicial decisions + that you gave in command to Moses your servant. + 8 “Remember, + please, the word that you commanded Moses your servant, saying, ‘Should YOU , for YOUR part, act unfaithfully, I, for my part, shall scatter YOU among the peoples. + 9 When YOU will have returned to me + and kept my commandments + and done them, + though YOUR dispersed people should happen to be at the end of the heavens, from there I shall collect + them and certainly bring them + to the place that I have chosen to have my name reside there.’ + 10 And they are your servants + and your people, + whom you redeemed by your great power + and by your strong hand. + 11 Ah, Jehovah, * please, let your ear become attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer + of your servants who take delight in fearing your name; + and, please, do grant success to your servant today + and make him an object of pity before this man.” + Now I myself happened to be cupbearer + to the king.
