Further, I appointed two large thanksgiving choirs + and processions, [and the one was walking] * to the right upon the wall to the Gate of the Ash-heaps. * + 32 And Ho·shaiʹah and half of the princes of Judah began to walk behind them, 33 also Az·a·riʹah, Ezʹra and Me·shulʹlam, 34 Judah and Benjamin and She·maiʹah and Jeremiah; 35 also of the sons of the priests with the trumpets + Zech·a·riʹah the son of Jonʹa·than the son of She·maiʹah the son of Mat·ta·niʹah the son of Mi·caiʹah the son of Zacʹcur + the son of Aʹsaph, + 36 and his brothers She·maiʹah and Azʹar·el, Milʹa·lai, Gilʹa·lai, Maʹai, Ne·thanʹel and Judah, Ha·naʹni, with the instruments + of song of David the man of the [true] God; and Ezʹra + the copyist before them. 37 And at the Fountain Gate + and straight ahead of them they went up on the Stairway + of the City of David + by the ascent of the wall above the House of David and clear to the Water Gate + to the east. 38 And the other thanksgiving choir + was walking in front, and I after it, also half of the people, upon the wall up over the Tower of the Bake Ovens + and on to the Broad Wall, + 39 and up over the Gate of Eʹphra·im + and on to the Gate of the Old [City] + and clear to the Fish Gate + and the Tower of Ha·nanʹel + and the Tower of Meʹah + and on to the Sheep Gate; + and they came to a stand at the Gate of the Guard. 40 At length the two thanksgiving choirs + came to a stand at the house + of the [true] God, also I and half of the deputy rulers with me, + 41 and the priests E·liʹa·kim, Ma·a·seiʹah, Mi·niʹa·min, * Mi·caiʹah, Eli·o·eʹnai, Zech·a·riʹah, Han·a·niʹah with the trumpets, + 42 and Ma·a·seiʹah and She·maiʹah, and El·e·aʹzar and Uzʹzi and Je·ho·haʹnan and Mal·chiʹjah and Eʹlam and Eʹzer. And the singers with Iz·ra·hiʹah the overseer kept making themselves heard. + 43 And they proceeded to sacrifice on that day great sacrifices + and to rejoice, + for the [true] God himself caused them to rejoice with great joy. + And also the women + and the children + themselves rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away. + 44 Further, there were appointed on that day men over the halls + for the stores, + for the contributions, + for the firstfruits + and for the tenths, * + to gather into them out of * the fields of the cities the portions [called for by] the law + for the priests and the Levites; + for the rejoicing of Judah was because of the priests and of the Levites + who were in attendance. 45 And they began taking care of the obligation + of their God and the obligation of the purification, + also the singers + and the gatekeepers, + according to the commandment of David [and] Solʹo·mon his son. 46 For in the days of David and Aʹsaph in bygone time there were heads of the singers + and the song of praise and thanksgivings to God. + 47 And all Israel during the days of Ze·rubʹba·bel + and during the days of Ne·he·miʹah + were giving the portions of the singers + and of the gatekeepers + according to the daily need * and were sanctifying [them] to the Levites; + and the Levites were sanctifying [them] to the sons of Aaron.
