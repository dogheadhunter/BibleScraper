Let us, please, leave off this lending on interest. + 11 Please, restore to them on this day their fields, + their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and the hundredth * of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil that YOU are exacting as interest from them.” 12 To this they said: “We shall make restoration, + and from them we shall ask nothing back. + We shall do precisely as you are saying.” + So I called the priests and made them swear to do according to this word. + 13 Also, my bosom I shook out and then said: “In this manner may the [true] God shake out from his house and from his acquired property every man that does not carry out this word; and in this manner may he become shaken out and empty.” To this all the congregation * said: “Amen!” * + And they began to praise Jehovah. + And the people proceeded to do according to this word. + 14 Another thing: From the day that he commissioned me to become their governor * + in the land of Judah, from the twentieth + year to the thirty-second + year of Ar·ta·xerxʹes + the king, twelve years, I myself and my brothers did not eat the bread due the governor. + 15 As for the former governors that were prior to me, they had made it heavy upon the people, and they kept taking from them for bread and wine daily * forty silver shekels. * Also, their attendants themselves domineered over the people. + As for me, I did not do that way + on account of the fear of God. + 16 And, what is more, in the work of this wall I took a hand, + and not a field did we acquire; + and all my attendants were collected together there for the work. 17 And the Jews and the deputy rulers, a hundred and fifty men, and those coming in to us from the nations that were around us were at my table. + 18 As for that which happened to be made ready daily, one bull, six select sheep and birds were made ready for me, and once every ten days every sort of wine + in abundance. And along with this the bread due the governor I did not demand, because the service upon this people was heavy. 19 Do remember for me, + O my God, for good, + all that I have done in behalf of this people. + Footnotes ^ “Giving as security,” by a slight correction of M.
