The pillar of cloud itself did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, + nor the pillar of fire by night to light up for them the way in which they should go. + 20 And your good spirit + you gave to make them prudent, and your manna you did not hold back from their mouth, + and water you gave them for their thirst. + 21 And for forty + years you provided them with food in the wilderness. They lacked nothing. + Their very garments did not wear out, + and their feet themselves did not become swollen. + 22 “And you proceeded to give them kingdoms + and peoples, and to apportion them piece by piece; + so that they took possession of the land of Siʹhon, + even the land of the king of Heshʹbon, + and the land of Og + the king of Baʹshan. + 23 And their sons you made as many as the stars of the heavens. + Then you brought them into the land + that you had promised to their forefathers + that [they] should enter to take possession. 24 So their sons + came in and took the land in possession, + and you proceeded to subdue + before them the inhabitants of the land, the Caʹnaan·ites, + and to give them into their hand, even their kings + and the peoples of the land, + to do with them according to their liking. + 25 And they went capturing fortified cities + and a fat soil + and taking in possession houses full of all good things, + cisterns hewn out, + vineyards and olive groves + and trees for food in abundance, and they began to eat and to be satisfied + and to grow fat + and to luxuriate in your great goodness. + 26 “However, they became disobedient + and rebelled against you + and kept casting your law behind their back, + and your own prophets they killed, + who bore witness against them to bring them back to you; + and they went on committing acts of great disrespect. + 27 For this you gave them into the hand of their adversaries, + who kept causing them distress; + but in the time of their distress they would cry out to you, + and you yourself would hear from the very heavens; + and in accord with your abundant mercy + you would give them saviors + who would save them out of the hand of their adversaries. + 28 “But as soon as they were at rest, they would again do what is bad before you, + and you would leave them to the hand of their enemies, who would tread them down. + Then they would return and call to you for aid, + and you yourself would hear from the very heavens + and deliver them in accord with your abundant mercy, time and again. + 29 Although you would bear witness + against them to bring them back to your law, + they themselves even acted presumptuously + and did not listen to your commandments; and against your own judicial decisions + they sinned, + which, if a man * will do, he must also live by means of them. * + And they kept giving a stubborn shoulder, + and their neck they hardened, + and they did not listen. + 30 But you were indulgent with them for many years + and kept bearing witness + against them by your spirit by means of your prophets, and they did not give ear. + Finally you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. + 31 And in your abundant mercy you did not make an extermination of them + or leave + them; for you are a God * gracious + and merciful. + 32 “And now, O our God, the God * great, + mighty + and fear-inspiring, * + keeping the covenant + and loving-kindness, * + do not let all the hardship that has found us, + our kings, + our princes + and our priests + and our prophets + and our forefathers + and all your people from the days of the kings of As·syrʹi·a down to this day, + seem little before you. + 33 And you are righteous + as regards all that has come upon us, for faithfully + is how you have acted, but we are the ones that have done wickedly. + 34 As for our kings, our princes, our priests and our forefathers, + they have not performed your law, + nor paid attention to your commandments + or to your testimonies * with which you bore witness + against them. 35 And they themselves—during their * kingdom + and amid your abundant good things + that you gave to them and in the broad and fat land + that you made available for them, they did not serve you + and did not turn back from their bad practices. + 36 Look! We are today slaves; + and as for the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things, look! we are slaves upon it, + 37 and its produce is abounding + for the kings + that you have put over us because of our sins, + and over our bodies they are ruling and over our domestic animals, according to their liking, and we are in great distress. * + 38 “So in view of all this we are contracting * a trustworthy arrangement, + both in writing and attested by the seal + of our princes, * our Levites [and] our priests.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “sons of a foreign (country).” ^ “There was a contracting.” In Heb. this is a verb in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal. ^ “In Egypt,” LXX and some Heb. mss; M, “in their rebellion.” ^ “A God.” Heb., ʼElohʹah, sing. of ʼElo·himʹ . ^ “Your God .” Heb., ʼelo·h eyʹkha, pl. to denote excellence, because the demonstrative pronoun zeh, “this,” and the verb he·ʽel·khaʹ, “led you,” are sing., showing that “God” is sing.; Gr., hoi the·oiʹ, “gods”; Lat., Deʹus tuʹus, “your God.” Compare Ex 32:4 ftn, “God.” ^ Or, “an earthling man.” Heb., ʼa·dhamʹ . ^ Or, “live in them.” ^ “God.” Heb., ʼEl . ^ Or, “the [true] God .” The title ʼEl preceded by the Heb. definite article ha, “the,” but followed by the qualifications “great, mighty and fear-inspiring.” See App 1G . ^ “And fear - inspiring ( reverend ).” Heb., wehan ·noh·raʼʹ . ^ Or, “loyal love.” ^ Or, “reminders; exhortations.” ^ “Their,” MVg; LXXSy and two Heb. mss, “your.” ^ MLXX end chapter 9 here. ^ Lit., “cutting.” ^ Lit., “and upon what was sealed of our princes.” Previous Next Print Share Share
