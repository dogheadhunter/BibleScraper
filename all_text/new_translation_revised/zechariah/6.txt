He will sit down on his throne and rule, and he will also be a priest on his throne, + and there will be a peaceable agreement between the two. * 14 And the crown * will serve as a memorial * for Heʹlem, To·biʹjah, Je·daʹiah, + and Hen the son of Zeph·a·niʹah, in the temple of Jehovah. 15 And those who are far away will come and take part in building the temple of Jehovah.” And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. And it will occur—if you do not fail to listen to the voice of Jehovah your God.’” Footnotes ^ That is, the chariot. ^ Or “a grand crown.” ^ That is, between his roles as ruler and priest. ^ Or “the grand crown.” ^ Or “reminder.” Previous Next Print Share Share
