I am a man cultivating the soil, because a man bought me when I was young.’ 6 And if someone asks him, ‘What are these wounds between your shoulders?’ * he will answer, ‘Wounds I received in the house of my friends.’” * 7 “O sword, awake against my shepherd, + Against the man who is my companion,” declares Jehovah of armies. “Strike the shepherd, + and let the flock * be scattered; + And I will turn my hand against those who are insignificant.” 8 “And in all the land,” declares Jehovah, “Two parts in it will be cut off and perish; * And the third part will be left remaining in it. 9 And I will bring the third part through the fire; And I will refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. + They will call on my name, And I will answer them. I will say, ‘They are my people,’ + And they will say, ‘Jehovah is our God.’” Footnotes ^ Lit., “between your hands?” That is, on the chest or on the back. ^ Or “of those who love me.” ^ Or “sheep.” ^ Or “die.” Previous Next Print Share Share
