I am also going.” + 22 And many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem + and to beg for the favor * of Jehovah.’ 23 “This is what Jehovah of armies says, ‘In those days ten men out of all the languages of the nations + will take hold, yes, they will take firm hold of the robe * of a Jew, * saying: “We want to go with you, + for we have heard that God is with you people.”’” + Footnotes ^ Or “faithfulness.” ^ Lit., “because of the multitude of days.” ^ Or “from the land of the sunrise and the land of the setting sun.” ^ Or “faithfulness.” ^ Or “Take courage.” ^ Or “Take courage.” ^ Or “soften the face.” ^ Or “soften the face.” ^ Or “extremity of the garment.” ^ Lit., “a Jewish man.” Previous Next Print Share Share
