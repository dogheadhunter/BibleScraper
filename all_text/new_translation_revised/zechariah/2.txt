Come! Flee from the land of the north,” + declares Jehovah. “For I have scattered you to the four winds of the heavens,” + declares Jehovah. 7 “Come, Zion! Make your escape, you who are dwelling with the daughter of Babylon. + 8 For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified * has sent me to the nations that were plundering you: + ‘Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye. * + 9 For now I will wave my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own slaves.’ + And you will certainly know that Jehovah of armies has sent me. 10 “Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion; + for I am coming, + and I will reside in your midst,” + declares Jehovah. 11 “Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, + and they will become my people; and I will reside in your midst.” And you will have to know that Jehovah of armies has sent me to you. 12 Jehovah will take possession of Judah as his portion on the holy ground, and he will again choose Jerusalem. + 13 Be silent, all flesh, * before Jehovah, for he is taking action from his holy dwelling.
