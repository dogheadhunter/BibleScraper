They had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the container between the earth and heaven. 10 So I asked the angel who was speaking with me: “Where are they taking the eʹphah container?” 11 He replied: “To the land of Shiʹnar * + to build her a house; and when it is prepared, she will be deposited there in her proper place.” Footnotes ^ A cubit equaled 44.5 cm (17.5 in.).
