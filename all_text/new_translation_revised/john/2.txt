You have saved the fine wine until now.” 11 Jesus did this in Caʹna of Galʹi·lee as the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest, + and his disciples put their faith in him. 12 After this he and his mother and his brothers + and his disciples went down to Ca·perʹna·um, + but they did not stay there many days. 13 Now the Passover + of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 He found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves, + and the money brokers in their seats. 15 So after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. + 16 And he said to those selling the doves: “Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of commerce!” * + 17 His disciples recalled that it is written: “The zeal for your house will consume me.” + 18 Therefore, in response the Jews said to him: “What sign can you show us, + since you are doing these things?” 19 Jesus replied to them: “Tear down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” + 20 The Jews then said: “This temple was built in 46 years, and will you raise it up in three days?” 21 But he was talking about the temple of his body. + 22 When, though, he was raised up from the dead, his disciples recalled that he used to say this, + and they believed the scripture and what Jesus had spoken. 23 However, when he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the Passover, many people put their faith in his name when they saw the signs that he was performing. 24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them because he knew them all 25 and because he did not need to have anyone bear witness about man, for he knew what was in man. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “What to me and to you, woman?” This is an idiom indicating objection. The use of “woman” does not denote disrespect. ^ Likely the liquid measure was the bath that equaled 22 L (5.81 gal). See App. B14 . ^ Or “a marketplace; a business.” Previous Next Print Share Share
