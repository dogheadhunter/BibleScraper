And may the spirit and soul * and body of you brothers, sound in every respect, be preserved blameless at the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ. + 24 The one who is calling you is faithful, and he will surely do so. 25 Brothers, keep praying for us. + 26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 27 I am putting you under the solemn obligation by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers. + 28 The undeserved kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
