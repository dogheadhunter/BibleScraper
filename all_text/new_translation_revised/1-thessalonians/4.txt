But we urge you, brothers, to go on doing so in fuller measure. 11 Make it your aim to live quietly + and to mind your own business + and to work with your hands, + just as we instructed you, 12 so that you may walk decently in the eyes of people outside + and not need anything. 13 Moreover, brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant * about those who are sleeping in death, + so that you may not sorrow as the rest do who have no hope. + 14 For if we have faith that Jesus died and rose again, + so too God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death through Jesus. + 15 For this is what we tell you by Jehovah’s * word, that we the living who survive to the presence of the Lord will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death; 16 because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s + voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first. + 17 Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds + to meet the Lord + in the air; and thus we will always be with the Lord. + 18 So keep comforting one another with these words.
