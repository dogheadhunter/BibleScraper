This will become your western boundary. + 7 “‘Now this will be your northern boundary: From the Great Sea you will mark your boundary out to Mount Hor. 8 From Mount Hor you will mark out the boundary to Leʹbo-haʹmath, * + and the end of the boundary will be at Zeʹdad. + 9 And the boundary will extend to Ziphʹron, and its end will be Haʹzar-eʹnan. + This will become your northern boundary. 10 “‘Then you should mark as your boundary on the east from Haʹzar-eʹnan to Sheʹpham. 11 The boundary will extend from Sheʹpham to Ribʹlah on the east of Aʹin, and the border will go down and cross the eastern slope of the Sea of Chinʹne·reth. * + 12 The border will extend to the Jordan, and its end will be the Salt Sea. + This will be your land + and the boundaries surrounding it.’” 13 So Moses instructed the Israelites, saying: “This is the land that you will apportion as your possession by lot, + just as Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine and a half tribes. 14 For the tribe of the Reuʹben·ites by their paternal house, the tribe of the Gadʹites by their paternal house, and the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh have already taken their inheritance. + 15 The two and a half tribes have already taken their inheritance east of the region of the Jordan by Jerʹi·cho, toward the sunrising.” + 16 Jehovah spoke further to Moses, saying: 17 “These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you to possess: El·e·aʹzar + the priest and Joshua + the son of Nun. 18 And you will take one chieftain out of each tribe to divide the land as your inheritance. + 19 These are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, + Caʹleb + the son of Je·phunʹneh; 20 of the tribe of the sons of Simʹe·on, + She·muʹel the son of Am·miʹhud; 21 of the tribe of Benjamin, + E·liʹdad the son of Chisʹlon; 22 of the tribe of the sons of Dan, + a chieftain, Bukʹki the son of Jogʹli; 23 of the sons of Joseph + from the tribe of the sons of Ma·nasʹseh, + a chieftain, Hanʹni·el the son of Eʹphod; 24 from the tribe of the sons of Eʹphra·im, + a chieftain, Kem·uʹel the son of Shiphʹtan; 25 of the tribe of the sons of Zebʹu·lun, + a chieftain, E·li·zaʹphan the son of Parʹnach; 26 of the tribe of the sons of Isʹsa·char, + a chieftain, Palʹti·el the son of Azʹzan; 27 of the tribe of the sons of Ashʹer, + a chieftain, A·hiʹhud the son of She·loʹmi; 28 of the tribe of the sons of Naphʹta·li, + a chieftain, Ped·ahʹel the son of Am·miʹhud.” 29 These are the ones whom Jehovah commanded to distribute the land to the Israelites in the land of Caʹnaan. + Footnotes ^ That is, the Dead Sea. ^ See Glossary . ^ That is, the Great Sea, the Mediterranean. ^ That is, the Mediterranean. ^ Or “the entrance of Hamath.” ^ That is, the lake of Gennesaret, or the Sea of Galilee.
