At that the scourge on the Israelites was halted. + 9 Those who died from the scourge amounted to 24,000. + 10 Then Jehovah said to Moses: 11 “Phinʹe·has + the son of El·e·aʹzar the son of Aaron the priest has turned my wrath away from the people of Israel because he tolerated no rivalry at all toward me among them. + So I have not exterminated the Israelites in my insistence on exclusive devotion. + 12 Therefore, say, ‘I am giving him my covenant of peace. 13 And it will serve as the covenant of a lasting priesthood for him and his offspring after him, + because he tolerated no rivalry toward his God + and he made atonement for the people of Israel.’” 14 Incidentally, the name of the Israelite man who was put to death along with the Midʹi·an·i·tess was Zimʹri the son of Saʹlu, a chieftain of a paternal house of the Simʹe·on·ites. 15 The name of the Midʹi·an·ite woman who was put to death was Cozʹbi the daughter of Zur; + he was a leader of the clans of a paternal house in Midʹi·an. + 16 Jehovah later said to Moses: 17 “Harass the Midʹi·an·ites and strike them down, + 18 because they have been harassing you with their cunning dealings against you in the affair of Peʹor + and of Cozʹbi the daughter of a chieftain of Midʹi·an, their sister who was put to death + in the day of the scourge over the affair of Peʹor.” + Footnotes ^ Or “attached itself to.” ^ Lit., “heads.” ^ Lit., “in front of the sun.” ^ Or “attached themselves to.” ^ Or “lance.” Previous Next Print Share Share
