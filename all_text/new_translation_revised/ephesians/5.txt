A man who loves his wife loves himself, 29 for no man ever hated his own body, * but he feeds and cherishes it, just as the Christ does the congregation, 30 because we are members of his body. + 31 “For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to * his wife, and the two will be one flesh.” + 32 This sacred secret + is great. Now I am speaking about Christ and the congregation. + 33 Nevertheless, each one of you must love his wife + as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “you.” ^ Or possibly, “you.” ^ Greek, por·neiʹa.
