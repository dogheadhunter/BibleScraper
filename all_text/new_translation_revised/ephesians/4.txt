When each respective member functions properly, this contributes to the growth of the body as it builds itself up in love. + 17 So this is what I say and bear witness to in the Lord, that you should no longer go on walking just as the nations also walk, + in the futility * of their minds. + 18 They are in darkness mentally and alienated from the life that belongs to God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the insensitivity * of their hearts. 19 Having gone past all moral sense, they gave themselves over to brazen conduct * + to practice every sort of uncleanness with greediness. 20 But you did not learn the Christ to be like this, 21 if, indeed, you heard him and were taught by means of him, just as truth is in Jesus. 22 You were taught to put away the old personality + that conforms to your former course of conduct and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires. + 23 And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude, * + 24 and should put on the new personality + that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty. 25 Therefore, now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, + because we are members belonging to one another. + 26 Be wrathful, but do not sin; + do not let the sun set while you are still angry; + 27 do not give the Devil an opportunity. * + 28 Let the one who steals steal no more; rather, let him do hard work, doing good work with his hands, + so that he may have something to share with someone in need. + 29 Let a rotten word not come out of your mouth, + but only what is good for building up as the need may be, to impart what is beneficial to the hearers. + 30 Also, do not be grieving * God’s holy spirit, + with which you have been sealed + for a day of releasing by ransom. + 31 Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, + anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech, + as well as everything injurious. + 32 But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, + freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you. + Footnotes ^ Or “lowliness of mind.” ^ Or “proclaimers of the good news.” ^ Or “training.” ^ Or “unity.” ^ Or “mature.” ^ Or “emptiness; vanity.” ^ Lit., “dulling.” ^ Or “shameless conduct.” Greek, a·selʹgei·a.
