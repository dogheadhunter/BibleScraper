But those intent on doing good will receive loyal love and faithfulness. + 23 There is benefit in every kind of hard work, But mere talk leads to want. + 24 The crown of the wise is their wealth; But the foolishness of the stupid is only foolishness. + 25 A true witness saves lives, * But a deceitful one lies with every breath. 26 There is strong confidence in the fear of Jehovah, + And it will be a refuge for his children. + 27 The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, To turn one away from the snares of death. 28 A multitude of people are a king’s majesty, + But a ruler without subjects is ruined. 29 The one who is slow to anger has great discernment, + But the impatient one displays his foolishness. + 30 A calm heart gives life * to the body, But jealousy is rottenness to the bones. + 31 The one who defrauds the lowly one insults his Maker, + But whoever shows compassion to the poor glorifies Him. + 32 The wicked one will be brought down by his own evil, But the righteous one will find refuge in his integrity. + 33 Wisdom rests quietly in the heart of an understanding person, + But among the stupid it must make itself known. 34 Righteousness exalts a nation, + But sin is disgraceful to a people. 35 The king finds pleasure in a servant who acts with insight, + But his fury is against the one who acts shamefully. + Footnotes ^ Or “crooked.” ^ Or possibly, “the stupid deceive others.” ^ Or “of making amends.” ^ Or “there is goodwill.” ^ Or “the bitterness of its soul.” ^ Or “inexperienced.” ^ Or “furious.” ^ Or “the man of thinking abilities.” ^ Or “inexperienced.” ^ Or “souls.” ^ Or “health.” Previous Next Print Share Share
