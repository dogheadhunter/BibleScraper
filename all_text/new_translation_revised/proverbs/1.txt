Let us set an ambush to shed blood. We will lie hidden, waiting for innocent victims without cause. 12 We will swallow them alive as the Grave * does, Whole, like those going down to the pit. 13 Let us seize all their precious treasures; We will fill our houses with spoil. 14 You should join us, * And we will all share equally what we steal.” * 15 My son, do not follow them. Keep your feet off their path, + 16 For their feet run to do evil; They hurry to shed blood. + 17 It is surely in vain to spread a net in full sight of a bird. 18 That is why these lie in ambush to shed blood; They lie hidden to take the lives * of others. 19 These are the ways of those seeking dishonest profit, Which will take away the life * of those who obtain it. + 20 True wisdom + cries aloud in the street. + It keeps raising its voice in the public squares. + 21 At the corner * of the busy streets it calls out. At the entrances of the city gates it says: + 22 “How long will you inexperienced ones love inexperience? How long will you ridiculers take pleasure in ridicule? And how long will you foolish ones hate knowledge? + 23 Respond to my reproof. * + Then I will pour out my spirit for you; I will make my words known to you. + 24 Because I called out, but you kept refusing, I stretched out my hand, but no one was paying attention, + 25 You kept neglecting all my advice And rejecting my reproof, 26 I also will laugh when disaster strikes you; I will mock when what you dread comes, + 27 When what you dread comes like a storm, And your disaster arrives like a storm wind, When distress and trouble come upon you. 28 At that time they will keep calling me, but I will not answer; They will eagerly look for me, but they will not find me, + 29 Because they hated knowledge, + And they did not choose to fear Jehovah. + 30 They refused my advice; They disrespected all my reproof. 31 So they will bear the consequences * of their way, + And they will be glutted with their own counsel. * 32 For the waywardness of the inexperienced will kill them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them. 33 But the one listening to me will dwell in security + And be undisturbed by the dread of calamity.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “To know.” ^ Or “what is just.” ^ Or “fairness.” ^ Or “wise guidance.” ^ Or “a parable.” ^ Or “reverence for.” ^ Or “law.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
