Who has uneasiness? Who has quarrels? Who has complaints? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has bleary * eyes? 30 Those lingering long over wine; + Those searching out * mixed wine. 31 Do not look at the wine’s red color As it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly, 32 For in the end it bites like a serpent, And it secretes poison like a viper. 33 Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will speak perverse things. + 34 And you will be like one lying down in the middle of the sea, Like one lying at the top of a ship’s mast. 35 You will say: “They have struck me, but I did not feel it. * They beat me, but I did not know it. When will I wake up? + I need another drink.” * Footnotes ^ Or “Restrain yourself.” ^ Or “a soul full of desire.” ^ Or possibly, “Cease from your own understanding.” ^ Or “of anyone whose eye is evil.” ^ Or “calculating in his soul.” ^ Lit., “his heart is not with you.” ^ Lit., “Redeemer.” ^ Or “child; youth.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
