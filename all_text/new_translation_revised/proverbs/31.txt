( 10 ) Industrious and hardworking ( 17 ) Kindness is on her tongue ( 26 ) Children and husband praise her ( 28 ) Charm and beauty fleeting ( 30 ) 31 The words of King Lemʹu·el, the weighty message his mother gave to instruct him: + 2 What should I tell you, O my son, What, O son of my womb, And what, O son of my vows? + 3 Do not give your vigor to women, + Nor follow ways that destroy kings. + 4 It is not for kings, O Lemʹu·el, It is not for kings to drink wine Nor for rulers to say, “Where is my drink?” + 5 So that they do not drink and forget what is decreed And pervert the rights of the lowly ones. 6 Give alcohol to those who are perishing + And wine to those in bitter distress. * + 7 Let them drink and forget their poverty; Let them remember their trouble no more. 8 Speak up in behalf of the speechless; Defend the rights of all who are perishing. + 9 Speak up and judge righteously; Defend the rights * of the lowly and the poor. + א [ Aleph ] 10 Who can find a capable * wife? + Her value is far more than that of corals. * ב [ Beth ] 11 Her husband trusts her from his heart, And he lacks nothing of value. ג [ Gimel ] 12 She rewards him with good, not bad, All the days of her life. ד [ Daleth ] 13 She obtains wool and linen; She delights to work with her hands. + ה [ He ] 14 She is like the ships of a merchant, + Bringing her food in from afar. ו [ Waw ] 15 She also rises while it is still night, Providing food for her household And portions for her female servants. + ז [ Zayin ] 16 She sets her mind on a field and buys it; She plants a vineyard from her own labors. * ח [ Heth ] 17 She prepares herself for hard work, * + And she strengthens her arms. ט [ Teth ] 18 She sees that her trading is profitable; Her lamp does not go out at night. י [ Yod ] 19 Her hands seize the distaff, And her hands take hold of the spindle. * + כ [ Kaph ] 20 She extends her palm to the lowly one, And she opens her hands to the poor. + ל [ Lamed ] 21 She does not worry about her household because of the snow, For her whole household is clothed in warm * garments. מ [ Mem ] 22 She makes her own bed covers. Her clothing is of linen and purple wool. נ [ Nun ] 23 Her husband is well-known in the city gates, + Where he sits among the elders of the land. ס [ Samekh ] 24 She makes and sells linen garments * And supplies belts to the merchants. ע [ Ayin ] 25 She is clothed with strength and splendor, And she looks to the future with confidence. * פ [ Pe ] 26 She opens her mouth in wisdom; + The law of kindness * is on her tongue. צ [ Tsade ] 27 She watches over the activity of her household, And the bread of laziness she does not eat. + ק [ Qoph ] 28 Her children rise up and declare her happy; Her husband rises up and praises her. ר [ Resh ] 29 There are many capable * women, But you—you surpass them all. ש [ Shin ] 30 Charm may be false, and beauty may be fleeting, * + But the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised. + ת [ Taw ] 31 Give her the reward for what she does, * + And let her works praise her in the city gates. + Footnotes ^ Or “those bitter of soul.” ^ Or “Plead the cause.” ^ Or “an excellent.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “with her earnings.” Lit., “from the fruitage of her hands.” ^ Lit., “girds her hips with strength.” ^ The distaff and the spindle were sticks used to spin or make thread and yarn. ^ Lit., “double.” ^ Or “undergarments.” ^ Or “laughs at a future day.” ^ Or “Loving instruction; The law of loyal love.” ^ Or “excellent.” ^ Or “empty.” ^ Lit., “Give her from the fruit of her hands.” Previous Next Print Share Share
