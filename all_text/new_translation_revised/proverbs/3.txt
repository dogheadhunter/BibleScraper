I will give it to you tomorrow,” If you can give it now. 29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor + When he lives in a sense of security with you. 30 Do not quarrel with a man for no reason + If he has done nothing bad to you. + 31 Do not envy the violent man + Nor choose any of his ways, 32 For Jehovah detests a devious person, + But His close friendship is with the upright. + 33 The curse of Jehovah is on the house of the wicked one, + But he blesses the home of the righteous. + 34 For he mocks those who ridicule, + But he shows favor to the meek. + 35 The wise will inherit honor, But the stupid ones glorify dishonor. + Footnotes ^ Or “law.” ^ Or “truth.” ^ Lit., “lean.” ^ Lit., “navel.” ^ Or “income.” ^ Or “very best.” ^ Or “winepresses.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Evidently referring to God’s qualities mentioned in the previous verses. ^ Or “your soul.” ^ Or “strike against anything.” ^ Or “within the power of your hand.” ^ Or “to whom it is owing.” Previous Next Print Share Share
