Take good care of * your sheep, + 24 For wealth does not last forever, + Nor a crown * for all generations. 25 The green grass disappears, new grass appears, And the vegetation of the mountains is gathered in. 26 The young rams provide your clothing, And the male goats provide the price of a field. 27 And there will be enough goat’s milk to feed you, To feed your household, and to sustain your servant girls.
