The ruin of the poor is their poverty. + 16 The activity of the righteous one leads to life; But the produce of the wicked one leads to sin. + 17 The one who heeds discipline is a path to life, * But the one who ignores reproof leads others astray. 18 The one who conceals his hatred speaks lies, + And the one spreading malicious reports * is stupid. 19 When words are many, transgression cannot be avoided, + But whoever controls his lips acts discreetly. + 20 The tongue of the righteous one is like the finest silver, + But the heart of the wicked one is worth little. 21 The lips of the righteous one nourish * many, + But the foolish die for lack of sense. + 22 It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich, + And He adds no pain * with it. 23 Engaging in shameful conduct is like a game to the stupid one, But wisdom is for the man of discernment. + 24 What the wicked one fears will come upon him; But the desire of the righteous will be granted. + 25 When the storm passes by, the wicked one will be no more, + But the righteous one is a foundation forever. + 26 Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, So the lazy person is to the one who sends him. * 27 The fear of Jehovah prolongs life, + But the years of the wicked will be cut short. + 28 The expectation * of the righteous brings joy, + But the hope of the wicked will perish. + 29 The way of Jehovah is a stronghold for the blameless one, + But it means ruin for evildoers. + 30 The righteous one will never be made to fall, + But the wicked will no longer inhabit the earth. + 31 The mouth of the righteous one produces * wisdom, But the perverse tongue will be cut off. 32 The lips of the righteous one know what is pleasing, But the mouth of the wicked is perverse.
