Listen carefully * to my discernment, + 2 So that you may guard your thinking abilities And safeguard knowledge with your lips. + 3 For the lips of a wayward * woman drip like a honeycomb, + And her mouth is smoother than oil. + 4 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood + And as sharp as a two-edged sword. + 5 Her feet descend into death. Her steps lead straight to the Grave. * 6 She gives no thought to the path of life. Her course wanders, but she does not know where. 7 Now, my sons, listen to me And do not turn away from what I am saying. 8 Stay far away from her; Do not go near the entrance of her house, + 9 So that you may not give your dignity to others + Nor reap years of what is cruel; + 10 So that strangers may not drain your resources * + And what you labored for go to the house of a foreigner. 11 Otherwise, you will groan at the end of your life When your flesh and body waste away + 12 And you say: “How I hated discipline! How my heart despised reproof! 13 I did not listen to the voice of my instructors Or pay attention to my teachers. 14 I have come to the brink of complete ruin In the midst of the entire congregation.” * + 15 Drink water from your own cistern And flowing * water from your own well. + 16 Should your springs be dispersed outside, Your streams of water in the public squares? + 17 Let them be for you alone, And not for strangers with you. + 18 May your own fountain * be blessed, And may you rejoice with the wife of your youth, + 19 A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat. * + Let her breasts satisfy * you at all times. May you be captivated by her love constantly. + 20 So why, my son, should you be captivated by a wayward * woman Or embrace the bosom of an immoral * woman? + 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; He examines all his paths. + 22 The wicked one is ensnared by his own errors, And he will be caught in the ropes of his own sin. + 23 He will die for lack of discipline And go astray because of his excessive foolishness.
