Is not discernment raising its voice? + 2 On the heights + along the road, It takes its position at the crossroads. 3 Next to the gates leading into the city, At the entrances of the doorways, It keeps crying out loudly: + 4 “To you, O people, I am calling; I raise my voice to everyone. * 5 You inexperienced ones, learn shrewdness; + You stupid ones, acquire an understanding heart. * 6 Listen, for what I say is important, My lips speak what is right; 7 For my mouth softly utters truth, And my lips detest what is wicked. 8 All the sayings of my mouth are righteous. None of them are twisted or crooked. 9 They are all straightforward to the discerning And right to those who have found knowledge. 10 Take my discipline instead of silver, And knowledge rather than the finest gold, + 11 For wisdom is better than corals; * All other desirable things cannot compare to it. 12 I, wisdom, dwell together with shrewdness; I have found knowledge and thinking ability. + 13 The fear of Jehovah means the hating of bad. + I hate self-exaltation and pride + and the evil way and perverse speech. + 14 I possess good advice and practical wisdom; + Understanding + and power + are mine. 15 By me kings keep reigning, And high officials decree righteousness. + 16 By me princes keep ruling, And nobles judge in righteousness. 17 I love those loving me, And those seeking me will find me. + 18 Riches and glory are with me, Lasting wealth * and righteousness. 19 My fruitage is better than gold, even refined gold, And what I produce is better than the finest silver. + 20 I walk in the path of righteousness, In the middle of the pathways of justice; 21 I give a rich inheritance to those who love me, And I fill up their storehouses. 22 Jehovah produced me as the beginning of his way, + The earliest of his achievements of long ago. + 23 From ancient times * I was installed, + From the start, from times earlier than the earth. + 24 When there were no deep waters, + I was brought forth, * When there were no springs overflowing with water. 25 Before the mountains were set in place, Before the hills, I was brought forth, 26 When he had not yet made the earth and its fields Or the first clods of earth’s soil. 27 When he prepared the heavens, + I was there; When he marked out the horizon * on the surface of the waters, + 28 When he established * the clouds above, When he founded the fountains of the deep, 29 When he set a decree for the sea That its waters should not pass beyond his order, + When he established * the foundations of the earth, 30 Then I was beside him as a master worker. + I was the one he was especially fond of + day by day; I rejoiced before him all the time; + 31 I rejoiced over his habitable earth, And I was especially fond of the sons of men. * 32 And now, my sons, listen to me; Yes, happy are those who keep my ways. 33 Listen to discipline + and become wise, And never neglect it. 34 Happy is the man who listens to me By coming early to * my doors day by day, By waiting next to my doorposts; 35 For the one finding me will find life, + And he receives approval from Jehovah. 36 But the one who ignores me harms himself, * And those who hate me love death.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “to the sons of men.” ^ Lit., “understand heart.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “Hereditary values.” ^ Or “From time immemorial.” ^ Or “brought forth as with labor pains.” ^ Lit., “a circle.” ^ Lit., “made strong.” ^ Or “decreed.” ^ Or “mankind.” ^ Or “By keeping awake at.” ^ Or “his soul.” Previous Next Print Share Share
