When will you rise up from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumbering, A little folding of the hands to rest, + 11 And your poverty will come like a bandit, And your want like an armed man. + 12 A useless and wicked man walks about with crooked speech; + 13 He winks with his eye, + signals with his foot, and motions with his fingers. 14 With a perverted heart, He is always scheming evil + and spreading contentions. + 15 Therefore, his disaster will come suddenly; In a moment he will be broken beyond healing. + 16 There are six things that Jehovah hates; Yes, seven things that he * detests: 17 Haughty eyes, + a lying tongue, + and hands that shed innocent blood, + 18 A heart plotting wicked schemes, + and feet that run quickly to evil, 19 A false witness who lies with every breath, + And anyone sowing contentions among brothers. + 20 Observe, my son, the commandment of your father, And do not forsake the instruction * of your mother. + 21 Always bind them around your heart; Tie them about your neck. 22 When you walk about, it will lead you; When you lie down, it will stand guard over you; And when you awaken, it will speak to you. * 23 For the commandment is a lamp, + And the law is a light, + And the reproofs of discipline are the way to life. + 24 They will guard you against the bad woman, + Against the seductive tongue of the immoral * woman. + 25 Do not desire her beauty in your heart + Or allow her to captivate you with her alluring eyes, 26 For because of a prostitute, a man is reduced to a loaf of bread, + But the wife of another man preys on a precious life. * 27 Can a man rake fire to his chest and not burn his garments? + 28 Or can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet? 29 It is the same with anyone having relations with his neighbor’s wife; No one who touches her will go unpunished. + 30 People do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy himself * when he is hungry. 31 Yet, when found, he will repay sevenfold; He will give up all the valuables of his house. + 32 Anyone committing adultery with a woman is lacking good sense; * The one who does so brings ruin on himself. * + 33 He will get only wounds and dishonor, + And his disgrace will not be wiped away. + 34 For jealousy makes a husband furious; He will show no compassion when he takes revenge. + 35 He will accept no compensation; * He will not be appeased, no matter how large you make the gift.
