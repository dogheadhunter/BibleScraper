The pastures of the shepherds will mourn, And the summit of Carʹmel will dry up.” + 3 “This is what Jehovah says, ‘“For three revolts * of Damascus, and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they threshed Gilʹe·ad with iron threshing sledges. + 4 So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazʹa·el, + And it will consume the fortified towers of Ben-haʹdad. + 5 I will break the bars of Damascus; + I will destroy the inhabitants from Bikʹath-aʹven And the one ruling * from Beth-eʹden; And the people of Syria will go as exiles to Kir,” + says Jehovah.’ 6 This is what Jehovah says, ‘“For three revolts of Gazʹa, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they took a whole group of exiles + to hand them over to Eʹdom. 7 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Gazʹa, + And it will consume her fortified towers. 8 I will destroy the inhabitants from Ashʹdod, + And the one ruling * from Ashʹke·lon; + I will turn my hand against Ekʹron, + And the remaining Phi·lisʹtines will perish,” + says the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.’ 9 This is what Jehovah says, ‘For three revolts of Tyre, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they handed over a whole group of exiles to Eʹdom, And because they did not remember the covenant of brothers. + 10 So I will send a fire onto the wall of Tyre, And it will consume her fortified towers.’ + 11 This is what Jehovah says, ‘For three revolts of Eʹdom, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because he pursued his own brother with the sword, + And because he refused to show mercy; In his anger he keeps tearing them apart relentlessly, And he remains furious with them continually. + 12 So I will send a fire into Teʹman, + And it will consume the fortified towers of Bozʹrah.’ + 13 This is what Jehovah says, ‘“For three revolts of the Amʹmon·ites, + and for four, I will not reverse it, Because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilʹe·ad to widen out their own territory. + 14 So I will set fire to the wall of Rabʹbah, + And it will consume her fortified towers, With a war cry in the day of battle, With a tempest in the day of storm wind. 15 And their king will go into exile together with his princes,” + says Jehovah.’ Footnotes ^ Meaning “Being a Load” or “Carrying a Load.” ^ Or “crimes.” ^ Lit., “the one holding the scepter.” ^ Lit., “the one holding the scepter.” Previous Next Print Share Share
