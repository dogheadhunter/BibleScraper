By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.” + 3 As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives with the temple in view, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately: 4 “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are to come to a conclusion?” + 5 So Jesus began to tell them: “Look out that nobody misleads you. + 6 Many will come on the basis of my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and will mislead many. 7 Moreover, when you hear of wars and reports of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must take place, but the end is not yet. + 8 “For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom; + there will be earthquakes in one place after another; there will also be food shortages. + These are a beginning of pangs of distress. + 9 “As for you, look out for yourselves. People will hand you over to local courts, + and you will be beaten in synagogues + and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them. + 10 Also, in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first. + 11 And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say; but whatever is given you in that hour, say this, for you are not the ones speaking, but the holy spirit is. + 12 Furthermore, brother will deliver brother over to death, and a father a child, and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. + 13 And you will be hated by all people on account of my name. + But the one who has endured * to the end + will be saved. + 14 “However, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation + standing where it should not be (let the reader use discernment), then let those in Ju·deʹa begin fleeing to the mountains. + 15 Let the man on the housetop not come down nor go inside to take anything out of his house; 16 and let the man in the field not return to the things behind to pick up his outer garment. 17 Woe to the pregnant women and those nursing a baby in those days! + 18 Keep praying that it may not occur in wintertime; 19 for those days will be days of a tribulation + such as has not occurred from the beginning of the creation that God created until that time, and will not occur again. + 20 In fact, unless Jehovah * had cut short the days, no flesh would be saved. But on account of the chosen ones whom he has chosen, he has cut short the days. + 21 “Then, too, if anyone says to you, ‘See! Here is the Christ,’ or, ‘See! There he is,’ do not believe it. + 22 For false Christs and false prophets will arise + and will perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones. 23 You, then, watch out. + I have told you all things beforehand. 24 “But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, + 25 and the stars will be falling out of heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. 26 And then they will see the Son of man + coming in the clouds with great power and glory. + 27 And then he will send out the angels and will gather his chosen ones together from the four winds, from earth’s extremity to heaven’s extremity. + 28 “Now learn this illustration from the fig tree: Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near. + 29 Likewise also you, when you see these things happening, know that he is near at the doors. + 30 Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen. + 31 Heaven and earth will pass away, + but my words will by no means pass away. + 32 “Concerning that day or the hour nobody knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but the Father. + 33 Keep looking, keep awake, + for you do not know when the appointed time is. + 34 It is like a man traveling abroad who left his house and gave the authority to his slaves, + to each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to keep on the watch. + 35 Keep on the watch, therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming, + whether late in the day or at midnight or before dawn * or early in the morning, + 36 in order that when he comes suddenly, he does not find you sleeping. + 37 But what I say to you, I say to all: Keep on the watch.” + Footnotes ^ Or “who endures.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Lit., “when the rooster crows.” Previous Next Print Share Share
