Then he went into a house, 20 and again the crowd gathered, so that they were not able even to eat a meal. 21 But when his relatives heard about it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying: “He has gone out of his mind.” + 22 Also, the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying: “He has Be·elʹze·bub, * and he expels the demons by means of the ruler of the demons.” + 23 So after calling them to him, he spoke to them with illustrations: “How can Satan expel Satan? 24 If a kingdom becomes divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand; + 25 and if a house becomes divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 26 Also, if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he cannot stand but is coming to an end. 27 In fact, no one who enters the house of a strong man is able to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then can he plunder his house. 28 Truly I say to you that all things will be forgiven the sons of men, no matter what sins they commit and what blasphemies they speak. 29 But whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit has no forgiveness forever + but is guilty of everlasting sin.” + 30 He said this because they were saying: “He has an unclean spirit.” + 31 Now his mother and his brothers + came, and standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. + 32 As there was a crowd sitting around him, they said to him: “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.” + 33 But he replied to them: “Who are my mother and my brothers?” 34 Then he looked at those sitting around him in a circle and said: “See, my mother and my brothers! + 35 Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother.” + Footnotes ^ Or “paralyzed.” ^ Or “paralyzed.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “appointed.” ^ Or “appointed.” ^ Or “the zealous one.” ^ A designation applied to Satan.
