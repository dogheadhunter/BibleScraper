The days are coming,’ says Jehovah, * ‘when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant. 9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their forefathers on the day I took hold of their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, + because they did not remain in my covenant, so I stopped caring for them,’ says Jehovah. * 10 “‘For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,’ says Jehovah. * ‘I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts I will write them. + And I will become their God, and they will become my people. + 11 “‘And they will no longer teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying: “Know Jehovah!” * For they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them. 12 For I will be merciful toward their unrighteous deeds, and I will no longer call their sins to mind.’” + 13 In his saying “a new covenant,” he has made the former one obsolete. + Now what is obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away. + Footnotes ^ Or “public servant.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “public service.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 .
