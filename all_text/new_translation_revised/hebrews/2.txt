I and the young children, whom Jehovah * gave me.” + 14 Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly shared in the same things, + so that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, + that is, the Devil, + 15 and that he might set free * all those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. + 16 For it is not really angels he is assisting, but he is assisting Abraham’s offspring. * + 17 Consequently, he had to become like his “brothers” in all respects, + so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, in order to offer a propitiatory sacrifice * + for the sins of the people. + 18 Since he himself has suffered when being put to the test, + he is able to come to the aid of those who are being put to the test. + Footnotes ^ Or “portents.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “emancipate.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “to offer an atoning sacrifice; to make atonement.” Previous Next Print Share Share
