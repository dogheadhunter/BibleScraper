What can man do to me?” + 7 Remember those who are taking the lead among you, + who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith. + 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, and forever. 9 Do not be led astray by various and strange teachings, for it is better for the heart to be strengthened by undeserved kindness than by foods, * which do not benefit those occupied with them. + 10 We have an altar from which those who offer sacred service at the tent have no authority to eat. + 11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is taken into the holy place as a sin offering by the high priest are burned up outside the camp. + 12 Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the city gate + in order to sanctify the people with his own blood. + 13 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the reproach he bore, + 14 for we do not have here a city that remains, but we are earnestly seeking the one to come. + 15 Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, + that is, the fruit of our lips + that make public declaration to his name. + 16 Moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, + for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices. + 17 Be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you + and be submissive, + for they are keeping watch over you * as those who will render an account, + so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing, for this would be damaging to you. 18 Keep praying for us, for we trust we have an honest * conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things. + 19 But I especially urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you the sooner. 20 Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great shepherd + of the sheep, our Lord Jesus, with the blood of an everlasting covenant, 21 equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us through Jesus Christ what is well-pleasing in his sight, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 22 Now I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to this word of encouragement, for I have written you a short letter. 23 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon, I will be with him when I see you. 24 Give my greetings to all those who are taking the lead among you and to all the holy ones. Those in Italy + send you their greetings. 25 The undeserved kindness be with all of you.
