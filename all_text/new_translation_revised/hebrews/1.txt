And after he had made a purification for our sins, + he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. + 4 So he has become better than the angels + to the extent that he has inherited a name more excellent than theirs. + 5 For example, to which one of the angels did God ever say: “You are my son; today I have become your father”? + And again: “I will become his father, and he will become my son”? + 6 But when he again brings his Firstborn + into the inhabited earth, he says: “And let all of God’s angels do obeisance to him.” * 7 Also, he says about the angels: “He makes his angels spirits, and his ministers * + a flame of fire.” + 8 But about the Son, he says: “God is your throne + forever and ever, and the scepter of your Kingdom is the scepter of uprightness. * 9 You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you + with the oil of exultation more than your companions.” + 10 And: “At the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. 11 They will perish, but you will remain; and just like a garment, they will all wear out, 12 and you will wrap them up just as a cloak, as a garment, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.” + 13 But about which of the angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet”? + 14 Are they not all spirits for holy service, * + sent out to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?
