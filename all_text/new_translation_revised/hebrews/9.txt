But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things * to do away with sin through the sacrifice of himself. + 27 And just as it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this to receive a judgment, 28 so also the Christ was offered once for all time to bear the sins of many; + and the second time that he appears it will be apart from sin, * and he will be seen by those earnestly looking for him for their salvation. + Footnotes ^ Or “the showbread.” ^ Or “the place of atonement.” ^ Lit., “various baptisms.” ^ Lit., “ransoming; redemption.” ^ Or “young cow.” ^ Lit., “inaugurated.” ^ Or “scroll.” ^ Or “the public service.” ^ Lit., “before the face of.” ^ Or “the ages.” See Glossary . ^ Or “it will not be to deal with sin.” Previous Next Print Share Share
