I have come (in the scroll * it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’” + 8 After first saying: “You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings”—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law— 9 then he says: “Look! I have come to do your will.” + He does away with what is first in order to establish what is second. 10 By this “will” + we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time. + 11 Also, every priest takes his station day after day to offer holy service * + and to make the same sacrifices often, + which can never take sins away completely. + 12 But this man offered one sacrifice for sins for all time and sat down at the right hand of God, + 13 from then on waiting until his enemies should be placed as a stool for his feet. + 14 For it is by one sacrificial offering that he has made those who are being sanctified perfect + for all time. 15 Moreover, the holy spirit also bears witness to us, for after it has said: 16 “‘This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says Jehovah. * ‘I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds I will write them.’” + 17 Then it says: “And I will no longer call their sins and their lawless deeds to mind.” + 18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. 19 Therefore, brothers, since we have boldness * for the way of entry into the holy place + by the blood of Jesus, 20 which he opened up * for us as a new and living way through the curtain, + that is, his flesh, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, + 22 let us approach with sincere hearts and complete faith, having had our hearts sprinkled clean from a wicked conscience + and our bodies bathed with clean water. + 23 Let us hold firmly the public declaration of our hope without wavering, + for the one who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider * one another so as to incite * to love and fine works, + 25 not forsaking our meeting together, + as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, + and all the more so as you see the day drawing near. + 26 For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, + there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, + 27 but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a burning indignation that is going to consume those in opposition. + 28 Anyone who has disregarded the Law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three. + 29 How much greater punishment do you think a person will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God and who has regarded as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant + by which he was sanctified, and who has outraged the spirit of undeserved kindness with contempt? + 30 For we know the One who said: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again: “Jehovah * will judge his people.” + 31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. 32 However, keep remembering the former days in which, after you were enlightened, + you endured a great struggle along with sufferings. 33 At times you were publicly exposed * both to reproaches and to tribulations, and at times you shared * with those who were having such an experience. 34 For you expressed sympathy for those in prison and you accepted joyfully the plundering of your belongings, + knowing that you yourselves have a better and an enduring possession. + 35 Therefore, do not throw away your boldness, * which will be richly rewarded. + 36 For you need endurance, + so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise. 37 For yet “a very little while,” + and “the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.” + 38 “But my righteous one will live by reason of faith,” + and “if he shrinks back, I have * no pleasure in him.” + 39 Now we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction, + but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives. * Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “men.” ^ Lit., “in the scroll of the book.” ^ Or “to perform public service.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “confidence.” ^ Lit., “inaugurated.” ^ Or “be concerned about; pay attention to.” ^ Or “motivate; stir up.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Lit., “were exposed as in a theater.” ^ Or “stood side by side.” ^ Lit., “freeness of speech.” ^ Or “my soul has.” ^ Or “souls.” Previous Next Print Share Share
