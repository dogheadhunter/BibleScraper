He is actually puffed up without proper cause by his fleshly frame of mind, 19 and he is not holding fast to the head, + to the one through whom the whole body is supplied and harmoniously joined together by means of its joints and ligaments and made to grow with the growth that is from God. + 20 If you died together with Christ with respect to the elementary things of the world, + why do you live as if still part of the world by further subjecting yourselves to the decrees: + 21 “Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,” 22 referring to things that all perish with their use, according to the commands and teachings of men? + 23 Although those things have an appearance of wisdom in a self-imposed form of worship and a false humility, a harsh treatment of the body, + they are of no value in combating the satisfying of the flesh.
