And show yourselves thankful. 16 Let the word of the Christ reside in you richly in all wisdom. Keep on teaching and encouraging * one another with psalms, + praises to God, spiritual songs sung with gratitude, * singing in your hearts to Jehovah. * + 17 Whatever it is that you do in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, thanking God the Father through him. + 18 You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, + as it is becoming in the Lord. 19 You husbands, keep on loving your wives + and do not be bitterly angry * with them. + 20 You children, be obedient to your parents in everything, + for this is well-pleasing to the Lord. 21 You fathers, do not be exasperating * your children, + so that they do not become downhearted. * 22 You slaves, be obedient in everything to those who are your human * masters, + not only when they are watching, just to please men, * but with sincerity of heart, with fear of Jehovah. * 23 Whatever you are doing, work at it whole-souled * as for Jehovah, * + and not for men, 24 for you know that it is from Jehovah * you will receive the inheritance as a reward. + Slave for the Master, Christ. 25 Certainly the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, + and there is no partiality. + Footnotes ^ Greek, por·neiʹa.
