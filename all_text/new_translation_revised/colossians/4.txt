Only these are my fellow workers for the Kingdom of God, and they have become a source of great comfort * to me. 12 Epʹa·phras, + a slave of Christ Jesus who is from among you, sends you his greetings. He is always exerting himself in your behalf in his prayers, so that you may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God. 13 For I bear him witness that he makes great efforts in your behalf and in behalf of those in La·o·di·ceʹa and Hi·e·rapʹo·lis. 14 Luke, + the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and so does Deʹmas. + 15 Give my greetings to the brothers in La·o·di·ceʹa and to Nymʹpha and to the congregation at her house. + 16 And when this letter has been read among you, arrange for it also to be read + in the congregation of the La·o·di·ceʹans and for you also to read the one from La·o·di·ceʹa. 17 Also, tell Ar·chipʹpus: + “Pay attention to the ministry that you accepted in the Lord, in order to fulfill it.” 18 Here is my greeting, Paul’s, in my own hand. + Keep my prison bonds + in mind. The undeserved kindness be with you. Footnotes ^ Lit., “buying out the appointed time.” ^ Or “a strengthening aid.” Previous Next Print Share Share
