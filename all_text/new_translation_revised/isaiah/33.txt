When you finish destroying, you will be destroyed. + When you finish betraying, you will be betrayed. 2 O Jehovah, show us favor. + Our hope is in you. Become our arm * + every morning, Yes, our salvation in the time of distress. + 3 At the sound of turmoil peoples flee. When you rise up, nations scatter. + 4 As the voracious locusts gather, so your spoil will be gathered; People will rush on it like swarms of locusts. 5 Jehovah will be exalted, For he resides in the heights above. He will fill Zion with justice and righteousness. 6 He is the stability of your times; An abundance of salvation, + wisdom, knowledge, and the fear of Jehovah + —This is his treasure. 7 Look! Their heroes cry out in the street; The messengers of peace weep bitterly. 8 The highways are deserted; There is no one traveling on the pathways. He * has broken the covenant; He has rejected the cities; He shows no regard for mortal man. + 9 The land mourns * and withers away. Lebʹa·non is ashamed; + it has decayed. Sharʹon has become like the desert, And Baʹshan and Carʹmel shake off their leaves. + 10 “Now I will rise up,” says Jehovah, “Now I will exalt myself; + Now I will magnify myself. 11 You conceive dried grass and give birth to stubble. Your own spirit will consume you like a fire. + 12 And peoples will become as the burnings of lime. As thorns cut down, they will be set ablaze with fire. + 13 You who are far away, listen to what I will do! And you who are nearby, acknowledge my might! 14 The sinners in Zion are in dread; + Trembling has seized the apostates: ‘Who of us can live where there is a consuming fire? + Who of us can live with unquenchable flames?’ 15 The one who walks in continual righteousness, + Who speaks what is upright, + Who rejects dishonest, fraudulent gain, Whose hands refuse a bribe rather than grabbing it, + Who closes his ear to talk of bloodshed, And who shuts his eyes to avoid seeing what is bad 16 —He will reside in the heights; His secure refuge * will be in rocky strongholds, His bread will be provided, And his water supply will never fail.” + 17 Your eyes will behold a king in his splendor; They will see a land far away. 18 In your heart you will recall * the terror: “Where is the secretary? Where is the one who weighed out the tribute? + Where is the one who counted the towers?” 19 You will no more see the insolent people, A people whose language is too obscure * to comprehend, Whose stammering tongue you cannot understand. + 20 Behold Zion, the city of our festivals! + Your eyes will see Jerusalem as a tranquil dwelling place, A tent that will not be moved. + Never will its tent pins be pulled out, And none of its ropes will be torn apart. 21 But there the Majestic One, Jehovah, Will be for us a region of rivers, of wide canals, Where no galley fleet will go And no majestic ships will pass by. 22 For Jehovah is our Judge, + Jehovah is our Lawgiver, + Jehovah is our King; + He is the One who will save us. + 23 Your ropes will hang loose; They cannot hold up the mast nor spread the sail. At that time an abundance of spoil will be divided up; Even the lame will take much plunder. + 24 And no resident * will say: “I am sick.” + The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error. + Footnotes ^ Or “strength.” ^ Referring to the enemy. ^ Or possibly, “dries up.” ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or “meditate on.” ^ Lit., “deep.” ^ Or “inhabitant.” Previous Next Print Share Share
