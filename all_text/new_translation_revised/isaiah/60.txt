The glory of Jehovah shines on you. + 2 For look! darkness will cover the earth And thick gloom the nations; But on you Jehovah will shine, And on you his glory will be seen. 3 Nations will go to your light + And kings + to your shining splendor. * + 4 Raise your eyes and look all around you! They have all been assembled; they are coming to you. From far away your sons keep coming, + And your daughters being supported on the hip. + 5 At that time you will see and become radiant, + And your heart will throb and overflow, Because the wealth of the sea will be directed to you; The resources of the nations will come to you. + 6 Throngs of camels will cover your land, * Young male camels of Midʹi·an and Eʹphah. + All those from Sheʹba—they will come; Gold and frankincense they will carry. They will proclaim the praises of Jehovah. + 7 All the flocks of Keʹdar + will be gathered to you. The rams of Ne·baʹioth + will serve you. They will come on my altar with approval, + And I will beautify my glorious house. * + 8 Who are these that fly along like clouds, Like doves to their dovecotes? * 9 For in me the islands will hope; + The ships of Tarʹshish are in the lead, * To bring your sons from far away, + Along with their silver and their gold, To the name of Jehovah your God and to the Holy One of Israel, For he will glorify * you. + 10 Foreigners will build your walls, And their kings will minister to you, + For in my indignation I struck you, But in my favor * I will have mercy on you. + 11 Your gates will be kept open constantly; + They will not be closed by day or by night, To bring to you the resources of the nations, And their kings will take the lead. + 12 For any nation and any kingdom that will not serve you will perish, And the nations will be utterly devastated. + 13 To you the glory of Lebʹa·non will come, + The juniper tree, the ash tree, and the cypress together, + To beautify the place of my sanctuary; I will glorify the place for my feet. + 14 The sons of those who oppressed you will come and bow down before you; All those treating you disrespectfully must bow down at your feet, And they will have to call you the city of Jehovah, Zion of the Holy One of Israel. + 15 Instead of your being abandoned and hated, with nobody passing through, + I will make you a source of everlasting pride, A cause for rejoicing throughout all generations. + 16 And you will actually drink the milk of nations, + At the breast of kings you will nurse; + And you will certainly know that I, Jehovah, am your Savior, And the Powerful One of Jacob is your Repurchaser. + 17 Instead of the copper I will bring in gold, And instead of the iron I will bring in silver, Instead of the wood, copper, And instead of the stones, iron; And I will appoint peace as your overseers And righteousness as your task assigners. + 18 No more will violence be heard in your land Or destruction and ruin within your boundaries. + And you will call your walls Salvation + and your gates Praise. 19 For you the sun will no longer be a light by day, Nor will the shining of the moon give you light, For Jehovah will become to you an eternal light, + And your God will be your beauty. + 20 No more will your sun set, Nor will your moon wane, For Jehovah will become for you an eternal light, + And the days of your mourning will have ended. + 21 And all your people will be righteous; They will possess the land forever. They are the sprout that I planted, The work of my hands, + for me to be beautified. + 22 The little one will become a thousand And the small one a mighty nation. I myself, Jehovah, will speed it up in its own time.” Footnotes ^ Or “to the brightness of your dawn.” ^ Lit., “you.” ^ Or “my house of beauty.” ^ Or “to the openings in the birdhouse?” ^ Or “beautify.” ^ Or “as at the first.” ^ Or “goodwill.” Previous Next Print Share Share
