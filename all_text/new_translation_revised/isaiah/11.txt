He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth + And put the wicked to death with the breath * of his lips. + 5 Righteousness will be the belt around his waist, And faithfulness the belt of his hips. + 6 The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb, + And with the young goat the leopard will lie down, And the calf and the lion * and the fattened animal will all be together; * + And a little boy will lead them. 7 The cow and the bear will feed together, And their young will lie down together. The lion will eat straw like the bull. + 8 The nursing child will play over the lair of a cobra, And a weaned child will put his hand over the den of a poisonous snake. 9 They will not cause any harm + Or any ruin in all my holy mountain, + Because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah As the waters cover the sea. + 10 In that day the root of Jesʹse + will stand up as a signal * for the peoples. + To him the nations will turn for guidance, * + And his resting-place will become glorious. 11 In that day Jehovah will again offer his hand, a second time, to reclaim the remnant of his people who are left from As·syrʹi·a, + from Egypt, + from Pathʹros, + from Cush, + from Eʹlam, + from Shiʹnar, * from Haʹmath, and from the islands of the sea. + 12 He will raise up a signal * for the nations and gather the dispersed ones of Israel, + and he will gather together the scattered ones of Judah from the four corners of the earth. + 13 The jealousy of Eʹphra·im will be gone, + And those who show hostility to Judah will be done away with. Eʹphra·im will not be jealous of Judah, Nor will Judah show hostility toward Eʹphra·im. + 14 And they will swoop down on the slopes * of the Phi·lisʹtines to the west; Together they will plunder the people of the East. They will thrust out their hand against * Eʹdom + and Moʹab, + And the Amʹmon·ites will become their subjects. + 15 Jehovah will divide * the gulf * of the Egyptian sea + And wave his hand over the River. * + With his scorching breath * he will strike it in its * seven torrents, And he will cause people to walk across in their sandals. 16 And there will be a highway + out of As·syrʹi·a for the remnant of his people who are left, + As there was for Israel in the day he came out of the land of Egypt.
