Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Look! It was because of your own errors + you were sold, And because of your own transgressions your mother was sent away. + 2 Why, then, was no one here when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? + Is my hand too short to redeem, Or is there no power in me to rescue? + Look! With my rebuke I dry up the sea; + I make rivers a desert. + Their fish rot for lack of water, And they die because of thirst. 3 I clothe the heavens with gloom, + And I make sackcloth their covering.” 4 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has given me the tongue of those taught, * + So that I may know how to answer * the tired one with the right word. * + He awakens me morning by morning; He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones. + 5 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah has opened my ear, And I was not rebellious. + I did not turn in the opposite direction. + 6 I offered my back to those striking me And my cheeks to those who plucked them bare. * I did not hide my face from humiliating things and from spit. + 7 But the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me. + That is why I will not feel humiliated. That is why I have set my face like a flint, + And I know that I will not be put to shame. 8 The One who declares me righteous is near. Who can accuse * me? + Let us stand up together. * Who has a case against me? Let him approach me. 9 Look! The Sovereign Lord Jehovah will help me. Who will pronounce me guilty? Look! They will all wear out like a garment. A moth will eat them up. 10 Who among you fears Jehovah And listens to the voice of his servant? + Who has walked in deep darkness, without any brightness? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and support himself on * his God. 11 “Look! All of you who are igniting a fire, Making sparks fly, Walk in the light of your fire, Among the sparks you have set ablaze. This is what you will have from my hand: In sheer pain you will lie down.
