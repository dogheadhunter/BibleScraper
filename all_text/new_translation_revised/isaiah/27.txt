I will trample them and set them on fire all together. 5 Otherwise, let him hold fast to my stronghold. Let him make peace with me; Peace let him make with me.” 6 In the coming days Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and sprout, + And they will fill the land with produce. + 7 Must he be struck with the stroke of the one striking him? Or must he be killed as with the slaughter of his slain? 8 With a startling cry you will contend with her when sending her away. He will expel her with his fierce blast in the day of the east wind. + 9 So in this way the error of Jacob will be atoned for, + And this will be the full fruitage when his sin is taken away: He will make all the stones of the altar Like chalkstones that have been pulverized, And no sacred poles * or incense stands will be left. + 10 For the fortified city will be deserted; The pastures will be forsaken and abandoned like a wilderness. + There the calf will graze and lie down And will consume her branches. + 11 When her twigs have dried up, Women will come and break them off, Making fires with them. For this people is without understanding. + That is why their Maker will show them no mercy, And the One who formed them will show them no favor. + 12 In that day Jehovah will beat out the fruit from the flowing stream of the River * to the Wadi * of Egypt, + and you will be gathered up one after the other, O people of Israel. + 13 In that day a great horn will be blown, + and those who are perishing in the land of As·syrʹi·a + and those dispersed in the land of Egypt + will come and bow down to Jehovah in the holy mountain in Jerusalem. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Apparently referring to Israel, here personified as a woman and likened to a vineyard. ^ See Glossary . ^ That is, the Euphrates. ^ See Glossary .
