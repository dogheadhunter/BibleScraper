I have rolled up my life like a loom worker; He cuts me off like the threads of the warp. From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end. + 13 I calm myself until the morning. Like a lion, he keeps breaking all my bones; From daylight to nightfall you keep bringing me to an end. + 14 Like the swift or the thrush, * so I keep chirping; + I keep cooing like the dove. + My eyes look wearily to the height: + ‘O Jehovah, I am in great distress; Be my support!’ * + 15 What can I say? He has spoken to me and acted. I will walk humbly * all my years Because of my bitter distress. * 16 ‘O Jehovah, by these things * every man lives, And in them is the life of my spirit. You will restore me to health and preserve me alive. + 17 Look! Instead of peace, I had great bitterness; But in your fondness for me, * You preserved me from the pit of destruction. + You have thrown all my sins behind your back. * + 18 For the Grave * cannot glorify you, + Death cannot praise you. + Those who go down into the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness. + 19 The living, the living can praise you, Just as I can this day. A father can give his sons knowledge about your faithfulness. + 20 O Jehovah, save me, And we will play my songs on stringed instruments + All the days of our life at the house of Jehovah.’” + 21 Isaiah then said: “Bring a cake of pressed dried figs and apply it to the boil, so that he may recover.” + 22 Hez·e·kiʹah had asked: “What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Jehovah?” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “days.” ^ Perhaps these stairs were used to count time, as on a sundial. ^ Or “composition.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
