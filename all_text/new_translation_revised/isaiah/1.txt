They have abandoned Jehovah; + They have treated the Holy One of Israel with disrespect; They have turned their backs on him. 5 Where will you be struck next as you add to your rebellion? + The whole head is sick, And the whole heart is diseased. + 6 From the sole of the foot to the head, nothing is healthy. There are wounds and bruises and open sores —They have not been treated * or bound up or softened with oil. + 7 Your land is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Foreigners devour your land right in front of you. + It is like a wasteland overthrown by foreigners. + 8 The daughter of Zion has been left like a shelter * in a vineyard, Like a hut in a cucumber field, Like a city under siege. + 9 Unless Jehovah of armies had left us a few survivors, We should have become just like Sodʹom, And we should have resembled Go·morʹrah. + 10 Hear the word of Jehovah, you dictators * of Sodʹom. + Pay attention to the law * of our God, you people of Go·morʹrah. + 11 “Of what benefit to me are your many sacrifices?” + says Jehovah. “I have had enough of your burnt offerings of rams + and the fat of well-fed animals, + And I have no delight in the blood + of young bulls + and lambs and goats. + 12 When you come to appear before me, + Who has required this from you, This trampling of my courtyards? + 13 Stop bringing in any more worthless grain offerings. Your incense is detestable to me. + New moons, + sabbaths, + the calling of conventions + —I cannot put up with the use of magical power + along with your solemn assembly. 14 I have * hated your new moons and your festivals. They have become a burden to me; I am tired of bearing them. 15 And when you spread out your palms, I hide my eyes from you. + Although you offer many prayers, + I am not listening; + Your hands are filled with blood. + 16 Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; + Remove your evil deeds from my sight; Stop doing bad. + 17 Learn to do good, seek justice, + Correct the oppressor, Defend the rights of the fatherless child, * And plead the cause of the widow.” + 18 “Come, now, and let us set matters straight between us,” says Jehovah. + “Though your sins are like scarlet, They will be made as white as snow; + Though they are as red as crimson cloth, They will become like wool. 19 If you show willingness and listen, You will eat the good things of the land. + 20 But if you refuse and rebel, You will be devoured by the sword, + For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken it.” 21 How the faithful city + has become a prostitute! + She was full of justice; + Righteousness used to lodge in her, + But now murderers. + 22 Your silver has become dross, + And your beer * is diluted with water. 23 Your princes are stubborn and partners with thieves. + Every one of them loves a bribe and chases after gifts. + They do not grant justice to the fatherless, * And the legal case of the widow never reaches them. + 24 Therefore the true Lord, Jehovah of armies, The Powerful One of Israel, declares: “Ah! I will rid myself of my adversaries, And I will take revenge on my enemies. + 25 I will turn my hand against you, I will smelt away your dross as with lye, And I will remove all your impurities. + 26 I will restore your judges as in the beginning And your advisers as at the start. + After this you will be called City of Righteousness, Faithful Town. + 27 With justice Zion will be redeemed, + And her people who return, with righteousness. 28 The rebels and the sinners will be broken together, + And those leaving Jehovah will come to their finish. + 29 For they will be ashamed of the mighty trees that you desired, + And you will be disgraced because of the gardens * that you chose. + 30 For you will become like a big tree with withering leaves, + And like a garden without water. 31 The strong man will become tow, * And his work a spark; Both of them will go up in flames together, With no one to extinguish them.” Footnotes ^ Meaning “Salvation of Jehovah.” ^ Or “its master.” ^ Lit., “pressed out.” ^ Or “booth.” ^ Or “rulers.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Or “My soul has.” ^ Or “the orphan.” ^ Or “wheat beer.” ^ Or “the orphans.” ^ Apparently trees and gardens connected with idolatrous worship. ^ A flammable ropelike fiber.
