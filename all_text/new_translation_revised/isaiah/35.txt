The glory of Lebʹa·non will be given to it, + The splendor of Carʹmel + and of Sharʹon. + They will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendor of our God. 3 Strengthen the weak hands, And make firm the knees that are shaking. + 4 Say to those who are anxious at heart: “Be strong. Do not be afraid. Look! Your own God will come with vengeance, God will come with retribution. + He will come and save you.” + 5 At that time the eyes of the blind will be opened, + And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. + 6 At that time the lame will leap like the deer, + And the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy. + For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, And streams in the desert plain. 7 The heat-parched ground will become a reedy pool, And the thirsty ground springs of water. + In the lairs where jackals rested, + There will be green grass and reeds and papyrus. 8 And a highway will be there, + Yes, a way called the Way of Holiness. The unclean one will not travel on it. + It is reserved for the one walking on the way; No one foolish will stray onto it. 9 No lion will be there, And no vicious wild beasts will come on it. They will not be found there; + Only the repurchased ones will walk there. + 10 Those redeemed by Jehovah will return + and come to Zion with a joyful cry. + Unending joy will crown their heads. + Exultation and rejoicing will be theirs, And grief and sighing will flee away. + Footnotes ^ Or “crocus.” Previous Next Print Share Share
