I exalt you, I praise your name, For you have done wonderful things, + Things purposed * from ancient times, + In faithfulness, + in trustworthiness. 2 For you have turned a city into a pile of stones, A fortified town into a crumbling ruin. The foreigner’s tower is a city no more; It will never be rebuilt. 3 That is why a strong people will glorify you; The city of tyrannical nations will fear you. + 4 For you have become a stronghold to the lowly, A stronghold to the poor in his distress, + A refuge from the rainstorm, And a shade from the heat. + When the blast of the tyrants is like a rainstorm against a wall, 5 As the heat in a parched land, You subdue the uproar of strangers. Like heat that is subdued by the shadow of a cloud, So the song of the tyrants is silenced. 6 In this mountain + Jehovah of armies will make for all the peoples A banquet of rich dishes, + A banquet of fine wine, * Of rich dishes filled with marrow, Of fine, filtered wine. 7 In this mountain he will do away with * the shroud that is enveloping all the peoples And the covering * that is woven over all the nations. 8 He will swallow up * death forever, + And the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces. + The reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, For Jehovah himself has spoken it. 9 In that day they will say: “Look! This is our God! + We have hoped in him, + And he will save us. + This is Jehovah! We have hoped in him. Let us be joyful and rejoice in the salvation by him.” + 10 For the hand of Jehovah will rest on this mountain, + And Moʹab will be trampled on in its place + Like straw trampled into a pile of manure. 11 He will slap out his hands into it Like a swimmer slapping out his hands to swim, And he will bring down its haughtiness + With the skillful movements of his hands. 12 And the fortified city, with your high walls of security, He will bring down; He will knock it down to the ground, to the very dust.
