I am a dried-up tree.’” 4 For this is what Jehovah says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths and who choose what I delight in and who hold fast to my covenant: 5 “I will give to them in my house and within my walls a monument and a name, Something better than sons and daughters. An everlasting name I will give them, One that will not perish. 6 As for the foreigners who join themselves to Jehovah to minister to him, To love the name of Jehovah + And to be his servants, All those who keep the Sabbath and do not profane it And who hold fast to my covenant, 7 I will also bring them to my holy mountain + And make them rejoice inside my house of prayer. Their whole burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar. For my house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.” + 8 The Sovereign Lord Jehovah, who is gathering the dispersed ones of Israel, + declares: “I will gather to him others besides those already gathered.” + 9 All you wild animals of the field, come to eat, All you wild animals in the forest. + 10 His watchmen are blind, + none of them have taken note. + All of them are speechless dogs, unable to bark. + They are panting and lying down; they love to slumber. 11 They are dogs with a voracious appetite; * They are never satisfied. They are shepherds who have no understanding. + They have all gone their own way; Every last one of them seeks his own dishonest gain and says: 12 “Come, let me take some wine, And let us drink our fill of alcohol. + And tomorrow will be like today, only far better!” Footnotes ^ Or “with a strong soul.” Previous Next Print Share Share
