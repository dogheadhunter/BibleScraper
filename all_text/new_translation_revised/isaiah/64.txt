Look! You became indignant, while we kept sinning, + We did so for a long time. Should we now be saved? 6 And we have all become like someone unclean, And all our acts of righteousness are like a menstrual cloth. + We will all wither like a leaf, And our errors will carry us off like the wind. 7 There is no one calling on your name, No one who stirs himself to take hold of you, For you have hidden your face from us, + And you cause us to waste away * because of * our error. 8 But now, O Jehovah, you are our Father. + We are the clay, and you are our Potter; * + We are all the work of your hand. 9 Do not become too indignant, O Jehovah, + And do not remember our error forever. Look at us, please, for we are all your people. 10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a wasteland. + 11 Our house * of holiness and glory, * Where our forefathers praised you, Has been burned with fire, + And all the things we cherished lie in ruins. 12 In view of this, will you still restrain yourself, O Jehovah? Will you remain silent and let us be afflicted so severely? + Footnotes ^ Or “patiently wait for.” ^ Lit., “by the hand of.” ^ Lit., “to melt.” ^ Or “the One who formed us.” ^ Or “temple.” ^ Or “beauty.” Previous Next Print Share Share
