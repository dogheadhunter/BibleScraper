You belong to me. 2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you, + And through the rivers, they will not flood over you. + When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame singe you. 3 For I am Jehovah your God, The Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I have given Egypt as a ransom for you, E·thi·oʹpi·a and Seʹba in exchange for you. 4 For you became precious in my eyes, + You were honored, and I have loved you. + So I will give people in place of you And nations in exchange for your life. * 5 Do not be afraid, for I am with you. + I will bring your offspring * from the east And gather you together from the west. + 6 I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ + And to the south, ‘Do not hold them back. Bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends of the earth, + 7 Everyone who is called by my name + And whom I created for my own glory, Whom I have formed and made.’ + 8 Bring out a people who are blind, though they have eyes, And who are deaf, though they have ears. + 9 Let all the nations assemble in one place, And let the peoples be gathered together. + Who among them can tell this? Or can they cause us to hear the first things? * + Let them present their witnesses to prove themselves right, Or let them hear and say, ‘It is the truth!’” + 10 “You are my witnesses,” + declares Jehovah, “Yes, my servant whom I have chosen, + So that you may know and have faith in me * And understand that I am the same One. + Before me no God was formed, And after me there has been none. + 11 I—I am Jehovah, + and besides me there is no savior.” + 12 “I am the One who declared and saved and made known When there was no foreign god among you. + So you are my witnesses,” declares Jehovah, “and I am God. + 13 Also, I am always the same One; + And no one can snatch anything out of my hand. + When I act, who can prevent it?” + 14 This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, + the Holy One of Israel: + “For your sakes I will send to Babylon and bring down all the bars of the gates, + And the Chal·deʹans, in their ships, will cry out in distress. + 15 I am Jehovah, your Holy One, + the Creator of Israel, + your King.” + 16 This is what Jehovah says, The One making a way through the sea And a path even through turbulent waters, + 17 The One who draws out the war chariot and the horse, + The army together with the mighty warriors: “They will lie down and not get up. + They will be extinguished, snuffed out like a burning wick.” 18 “Do not remember the former things, And do not dwell on the past. 19 Look! I am doing something new; + Even now it is springing up. Do you not recognize it? I will make a way through the wilderness + And rivers through the desert. + 20 The wild beast of the field will honor me, The jackals and the ostriches, For I provide water in the wilderness, Rivers in the desert, + For my people, my chosen one, + to drink, 21 The people whom I formed for myself So that they might declare my praise. + 22 But you have not called on me, O Jacob, + Because you grew weary of me, O Israel. + 23 You have not brought me sheep for your whole burnt offerings Or glorified me with your sacrifices. I have not compelled you to bring me a gift, Nor have I made you weary by demanding frankincense. + 24 You did not buy me sweet cane * with your money, And with the fat of your sacrifices you did not satisfy me. + Instead, you have burdened me with your sins And made me weary with your errors. + 25 I, I am the One who is blotting out your transgressions * + for my own sake, + And I will not remember your sins. + 26 Remind me; let us bring our case against each other; Tell your side of it to prove you are in the right. 27 Your first forefather sinned, And your own spokesmen * have rebelled against me. + 28 So I will profane the princes of the holy place, And I will give Jacob over to destruction And subject Israel to insulting words. + Footnotes ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Possibly referring to the first things to come in the future. ^ Or “and trust me.” ^ An aromatic reed. ^ Or “rebellious acts.” ^ Possibly referring to teachers of the Law.
