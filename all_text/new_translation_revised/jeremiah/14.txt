They sink to the ground dejected, And a cry goes up from Jerusalem. 3 And their masters send their servants * for water. They go to the water holes * and find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They are ashamed and disappointed, And they cover their heads. 4 Because the ground is cracked, For there is no rain on the land, + The farmers are dismayed and cover their heads. 5 Even the doe in the field forsakes her newborn Because there is no grass. 6 The wild donkeys stand on the bare hills. They pant for air like jackals; Their eyes fail because there is no vegetation. + 7 Although our own errors testify against us, O Jehovah, act for the sake of your name. + For our acts of unfaithfulness are many, + And it is against you that we have sinned. 8 O hope of Israel, his Savior + in times of distress, Why are you like a stranger in the land, Like a traveler who stops only to spend the night? 9 Why are you like a man who is stunned, Like a mighty man who cannot save? For you are among us, O Jehovah, + And your name has been called on us. + Do not abandon us. 10 This is what Jehovah says concerning this people: “They love to wander about; + they have not restrained their feet. + So Jehovah finds no pleasure in them. + Now he will remember their error and call them to account for their sins.” + 11 Then Jehovah said to me: “Do not pray for good to come to this people. + 12 When they fast, I do not listen to their entreaties, + and when they offer whole burnt offerings and grain offerings, I take no pleasure in them, + for by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, * I will do away with them.” + 13 At this I said: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here the prophets are saying to them, ‘You will not see the sword, and famine will not come upon you, but I will give you true peace in this place.’” + 14 Jehovah then said to me: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. + I have not sent them or commanded them or spoken to them. + A lying vision and a worthless divination and the deceit of their own heart is what they are prophesying to you. + 15 Therefore this is what Jehovah says concerning the prophets who are prophesying in my name, though I did not send them, and who say that no sword or famine will occur in this land: ‘By sword and by famine those prophets will perish. + 16 And the people to whom they are prophesying will be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword, with no one to bury them + —them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters—for I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.’ + 17 “You must speak this word to them, ‘Let my eyes stream with tears night and day, let them not cease, + For the virgin daughter of my people has been completely crushed and broken, + With an extremely severe wound. 18 If I go out into the field and look, I see those slain by the sword! + And if I come into the city, I see the diseases from the famine! + For both the prophet and the priest have gone around in a land that they do not know.’” + 19 Have you completely rejected Judah, or have you * abhorred Zion? + Why have you struck us, so that there is no healing for us? + There was a hope for peace, but nothing good came, For a time of healing, but there is terror! + 20 We acknowledge our wickedness, O Jehovah, And the error of our forefathers, For we have sinned against you. + 21 For the sake of your name, do not reject us; + Do not despise your glorious throne. Remember, and do not break your covenant with us. + 22 Can any of the worthless idols of the nations give rain, Or can even the heavens send showers of rain on their own? Are you not the only One, O Jehovah our God? + And we hope in you, For you alone have done all these things.
