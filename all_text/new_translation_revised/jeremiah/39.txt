On that day he also gave them vineyards and fields to work. * + 11 Now King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar * of Babylon gave Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the guard these orders concerning Jeremiah: 12 “Take him and look after him; do him no harm, and grant whatever he asks of you.” + 13 So Neb·uʹzar·adʹan the chief of the guard, Neb·u·shazʹban the Rabʹsa·ris, * Nerʹgal-shar·eʹzer the Rabʹmag, * and all the principal men of the king of Babylon sent 14 and had Jeremiah taken out of the Courtyard of the Guard + and handed him over to Ged·a·liʹah + the son of A·hiʹkam + the son of Shaʹphan + to be brought to his house. So he lived among the people. 15 While Jeremiah was confined in the Courtyard of the Guard, + the word of Jehovah came to him, saying: 16 “Go and tell Eʹbed-melʹech + the E·thi·oʹpi·an, ‘This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says: “Here I am fulfilling my words on this city for calamity and not for good, and in that day you will see it happen.”’ 17 “‘But I will rescue you in that day,’ declares Jehovah, ‘and you will not be handed over to the men you fear.’ 18 “‘For I will surely provide you with escape, and you will not fall by the sword. You will have your life * as a spoil, * + because you trusted in me,’ + declares Jehovah.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “Nebuchadrezzar,” a variant spelling. ^ Or according to a different word division of the Hebrew text, “Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris.” ^ Or “the chief magician (astrologer).” ^ Lit., “Nebuchadrezzar,” a variant spelling. ^ Or “palace.” ^ Or possibly, “compulsory services.” ^ Lit., “Nebuchadrezzar,” a variant spelling. ^ Or “the chief court official.” ^ Or “the chief magician (astrologer).” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “will escape with your life.” Previous Next Print Share Share
