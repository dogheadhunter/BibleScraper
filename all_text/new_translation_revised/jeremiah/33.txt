The days are coming,’ declares Jehovah, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise that I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah. + 15 In those days and at that time I will cause to sprout for David a righteous sprout, * + and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land. + 16 In those days Judah will be saved + and Jerusalem will reside in security. + And this is what she will be called: Jehovah Is Our Righteousness.’” + 17 “For this is what Jehovah says: ‘There will never fail to be a man from David’s line to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, + 18 nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man stand before me to offer whole burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to offer sacrifices.’” 19 And the word of Jehovah again came to Jeremiah, saying: 20 “This is what Jehovah says, ‘If you could break my covenant regarding the day and my covenant regarding the night, to prevent day and night from coming at their proper time, + 21 only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken, + so that he should not have a son ruling as king on his throne, + and so also my covenant with the Levitical priests, my ministers. + 22 Just as the army of the heavens cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring * of my servant David and the Levites who are ministering to me.’” 23 And the word of Jehovah again came to Jeremiah, saying: 24 “Have you not taken note of what this people is saying, ‘Jehovah will reject the two families that he chose’? And they are treating my own people with disrespect, and they no longer regard them as a nation. 25 “This is what Jehovah says: ‘Just as surely as I have established my covenant regarding the day and the night, + the laws * of heaven and earth, + 26 so I will never reject the offspring * of Jacob and of my servant David, so as not to take from his offspring * rulers over the descendants * of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will gather back their captives + and have pity on them.’” + Footnotes ^ Or “heir.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “statutes.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “seed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
