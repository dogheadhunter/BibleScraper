You will go off to Babylon and die there, and you will be buried there with all your friends, because you have prophesied lies to them.’” + 7 You have fooled me, O Jehovah, and I was fooled. You used your strength against me, and you prevailed. + I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone ridicules me. + 8 For whenever I speak, I must cry out and proclaim, “Violence and destruction!” For me the word of Jehovah has been the cause of insults and jeering all day long. + 9 So I said: “I am not going to make mention of him, And I will speak no more in his name.” + But in my heart it became like a burning fire shut up in my bones, And I was tired of holding it in; I could no longer endure it. + 10 For I heard many evil rumors; Terror surrounded me. + “Denounce him; let us denounce him!” Every man wishing me peace was watching for my downfall: + “Perhaps he will make a foolish mistake, And we can prevail and take our revenge against him.” 11 But Jehovah was with me like a fearsome warrior. + That is why those persecuting me will stumble and will not prevail. + They will be put to great shame, for they will not succeed. Their everlasting humiliation will not be forgotten. + 12 But you, O Jehovah of armies, are examining the righteous one; You see the innermost thoughts * and the heart. + Let me see your vengeance on them, + For to you I have committed my legal case. + 13 Sing to Jehovah! Praise Jehovah! For he has rescued the poor one * from the hand of evildoers. 14 Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother gave birth to me not be blessed! + 15 Cursed be the man who brought good news to my father, saying: “A son has been born to you, a boy!” Making him rejoice greatly. 16 May that man become like cities that Jehovah overthrew without regret. May he hear an outcry in the morning and the sound of alarm at midday. 17 Why did he not put me to death in the womb, So that my mother would become my burial place And her womb would always remain pregnant? + 18 Why did I have to come out of the womb To see trouble and grief, To end my days in shame? + Footnotes ^ Or “deepest emotions.” Lit., “kidneys.” ^ Or “the soul of the poor one.” Previous Next Print Share Share
