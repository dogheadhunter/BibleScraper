I am weary from my groaning, and I have found no resting-place.”’ 4 “You should say to him, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Look! What I have built up I am tearing down, and what I have planted I am uprooting—the entire land. + 5 But you are seeking * great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.”’ “‘For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh,’ * + declares Jehovah, ‘and wherever you may go, I will grant you your life * as a spoil.’” * + Footnotes ^ Or “expecting.” ^ Or “people.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “will let you escape with your life.” Previous Next Print Share Share
