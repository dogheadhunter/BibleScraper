The utensils of the house of Jehovah will be brought back from Babylon very soon!” + for they are prophesying lies to you. + 17 Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and you will keep living. + Why should this city become a ruin? 18 But if they are prophets and if the word of Jehovah is with them, please let them beg Jehovah of armies that the remaining utensils in the house of Jehovah, in the house * of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not be taken away to Babylon.’ 19 “For this is what Jehovah of armies says concerning the pillars, + the Sea, * + the carriages, + and the remaining utensils that are left in this city, 20 which King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar of Babylon did not take when he took into exile Jec·o·niʹah son of Je·hoiʹa·kim, the king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; + 21 yes, this is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the utensils that are left at the house of Jehovah, in the house * of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: 22 ‘“To Babylon they will be brought, + and there they will remain until the day I turn my attention to them,” declares Jehovah. “Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.”’” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “to whom it is right in my eyes.” ^ Or “disease.” ^ Lit., “rest.” ^ Or “palace.” ^ That is, the copper Sea of the temple. ^ Or “palace.” Previous Next Print Share Share
