They will grow grain and will bud like the vine. + His fame * will be like the wine of Lebʹa·non. 8 Eʹphra·im will say, ‘What more do I have to do with idols?’ + I will answer and watch over him. + I will be like a thriving juniper tree. From me your fruit will be found.” 9 Who is wise? Let him understand these things. Who is discreet? Let him know them. For the ways of Jehovah are upright, + And the righteous will walk in them; But the transgressors will stumble in them.
