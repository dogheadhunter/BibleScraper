And He told him: “Name her Lo-ru·haʹmah, * for I will no longer show mercy + to the house of Israel, because I will certainly drive them away. + 7 But I will show mercy to the house of Judah, + and I will save them by Jehovah their God; + I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.” + 8 After weaning Lo-ru·haʹmah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. 9 Then He said: “Name him Lo-amʹmi, * because you are not my people and I will not be yours. 10 “And the number of the people * of Israel will be like the grains of sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. + And in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ + it will be said to them, ‘The sons of the living God.’ + 11 And the people of Judah and of Israel will be gathered together into unity + and will choose for themselves one head and go up out of the land, for great will be the day of Jezʹre·el. + Footnotes ^ Shortened form of Hoshaiah, which means “Saved by Jah; Jah Has Saved.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Meaning “God Will Sow Seed.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Meaning “Not Shown Mercy.” ^ Meaning “Not My People.” ^ Lit., “sons.” Previous Next Print Share Share
