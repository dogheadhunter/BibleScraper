For by prostitution * you have strayed from your God. + You have loved the wages of a prostitute on every threshing floor of grain. + 2 But the threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, And new wine will fail her. + 3 They will not continue dwelling in the land of Jehovah; + Instead, Eʹphra·im will return to Egypt, And in As·syrʹi·a they will eat what is unclean. + 4 They will no longer pour out wine offerings to Jehovah; + Their sacrifices will not please him. + They are like the bread of mourning; All those eating it will defile themselves. For their bread is for themselves alone; * It will not come into the house of Jehovah. 5 What will you do in the day of meeting, * In the day of Jehovah’s festival? 6 For look! they will have to flee because of destruction. + Egypt will gather them together, + and Memʹphis will bury them. + Nettles will take possession of their precious things of silver, And thornbushes will be in their tents. 7 The days of reckoning will come, + The days of retribution will come, And Israel will know it. Their prophet will be a fool, and the man of inspiration will go mad; Because your error is abundant, the animosity against you is abundant.” 8 The watchman + of Eʹphra·im was with my God. + But now all the ways of his prophets + are as the traps of a birdcatcher; There is animosity in the house of his God. 9 They have sunk deep into ruin, as in the days of Gibʹe·ah. + He will remember their error and punish their sins. + 10 “Like grapes in the wilderness I found Israel. + Like the first of the early figs on a fig tree I saw your forefathers. But they went to Baʹal of Peʹor; + They dedicated themselves to the shameful thing, * + And they became disgusting like the object of their love. 11 Eʹphra·im’s glory flies away like a bird; There is no giving birth, no pregnancy, and no conception. + 12 Even if they raise children, I will bereave them until no man is left; + Yes, woe to them when I turn away from them! + 13 Eʹphra·im, planted in a pasture, was to me like Tyre; + Now Eʹphra·im must bring his sons out to the slaughter.” 14 Give them, O Jehovah, what you should give them; A womb that miscarries and dry * breasts. 15 “All their wickedness was in Gilʹgal, + for there I came to hate them. I will drive them away from my house because of their evil deeds. + I will no longer love them; + All their princes are stubborn. 16 Eʹphra·im will be struck down. + Their root will dry up, and they will produce no fruit. Even if they give birth, I will put to death their cherished offspring.” 17 My God will reject them, For they have not listened to him, + And they will become fugitives among the nations. + Footnotes ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “for their own soul.” ^ Or “your appointed feast.” ^ Or “the shameful god.” ^ Or “shriveled.” Previous Next Print Share Share
