How can I treat you like Adʹmah? How can I make you like Ze·boiʹim? + I have had a change of heart; At the same time my compassions are stirred. * + 9 I will not vent my burning anger. I will not destroy Eʹphra·im again, + For I am God and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come against you in fury. 10 They will walk after Jehovah, and he will roar like a lion; + When he roars, his sons will come trembling from the west. + 11 They will tremble like a bird when they come out of Egypt, Like a dove out of the land of As·syrʹi·a; + And I will settle them in their houses,” declares Jehovah. + 12 “Eʹphra·im has surrounded me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit. + But Judah still roams * with God, And he is faithful to the Most Holy One.” + Footnotes ^ That is, prophets and others sent to instruct Israel. ^ Or “the ropes of kindness,” like those of a parent. ^ That is, to an elevated form of worship. ^ Lit., “have grown hot.” ^ Or “walks.” Previous Next Print Share Share
