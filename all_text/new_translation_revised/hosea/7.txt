And his gray hairs have turned white, but he does not notice it. 10 The pride of Israel has testified against him, + But they have not returned to Jehovah their God, + Nor have they looked for him despite all of this. 11 Eʹphra·im is like a simpleminded dove, lacking good sense. * + They have called out to Egypt; + they have gone to As·syrʹi·a. + 12 Wherever they go, I will spread my net over them. I will bring them down like the birds of the heavens. I will discipline them according to the warning given to their assembly. + 13 Woe to them, for they have fled from me! Devastation to them, for they have transgressed against me! I was ready to redeem them, but they have spoken lies against me. + 14 From their heart they did not call to me for help, + Although they kept wailing on their beds. For their grain and new wine they would slash themselves; They turn against me. 15 Although I disciplined them and strengthened their arms, They are against me, scheming what is bad. 16 They changed course, but not to anything loftier; * They were as unreliable as a loose bow. + Their princes will fall by the sword because of their defiant tongues. For this they will be an object of ridicule in the land of Egypt.” + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “For their hearts are like an oven as they approach with their intrigues.” ^ Lit., “judges.” ^ Lit., “without heart.” ^ That is, not to an elevated form of worship.
