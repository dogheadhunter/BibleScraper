And I will silence * your mother. 6 My people will be silenced, * because there is no knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, + I will also reject you from serving as my priest; And because you have forgotten the law * of your God, + I myself will forget your sons. 7 The more they increased, the more they sinned against me. + I will change their glory into disgrace. * 8 They feed on the sin of my people, And they are greedy for * their error. 9 It will be the same for the people as for the priest; I will call them to account for their ways, And I will bring on them the consequences of their actions. + 10 They will eat but not be satisfied. + They will be promiscuous, * but they will not increase, + Because they have shown no regard for Jehovah. 11 Prostitution * and wine and new wine Take away the motivation to do what is right. * + 12 My people consult their wooden idols, Doing what their staff * tells them; Because the spirit of prostitution * causes them to go astray, And by their prostitution * they refuse to submit to their God. 13 On the tops of the mountains they sacrifice, + And on the hills they make sacrifices smoke, Under oak trees and storax trees and every big tree, + Because their shade is good. That is why your daughters commit prostitution * And your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 14 I will not hold an accounting against your daughters because of their prostitution, * And against your daughters-in-law because of their adultery. For the men go off with the harlots And sacrifice with the temple prostitutes; Such a people without understanding + will come to ruin. 15 Although you are committing prostitution, * O Israel, + Let not Judah become guilty. + Do not come to Gilʹgal + or to Beth-aʹven, + And do not swear, ‘As surely as Jehovah is alive!’ + 16 For like a stubborn cow, Israel has become stubborn. + Will Jehovah now shepherd them like a young ram in an open pasture? * 17 Eʹphra·im is joined to idols. + Let him alone! 18 When their beer * is finished, They become promiscuous. * And her rulers * dearly love dishonor. + 19 The wind will wrap her * in its wings, And they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.” Footnotes ^ Or “destroy.” ^ Or “destroyed.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Or possibly, “They have exchanged my own glory for disgrace.” ^ Or “lift up their soul to.” See Glossary , “Soul.” ^ Or “be grossly immoral; engage in prostitution.” ^ Lit., “Take away heart.” ^ Or “Immorality; Promiscuity.” ^ Or “diviner’s rod.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Or “immorality; promiscuity.” ^ Lit., “a roomy place?” ^ Or “wheat beer.” ^ Or “become grossly immoral; engage in prostitution.” ^ Lit., “shields.” ^ Or “will sweep her away.” Previous Next Print Share Share
