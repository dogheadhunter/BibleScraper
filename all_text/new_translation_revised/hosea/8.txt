They have appointed princes, but I did not recognize them. With their silver and their gold they have made idols, + To their own destruction. + 5 Your calf has been rejected, O Sa·marʹi·a. + My anger flares up against them. + How long will they be incapable of innocence? * 6 For this is from Israel. A craftsman made it, and it is not God; The calf of Sa·marʹi·a will be reduced to splinters. 7 For it is wind that they are sowing, And they will reap a storm wind. + No stalk produces ripe * grain; + Whatever sprouts produces no flour. If any is produced, foreigners * will swallow it down. + 8 Israel will be swallowed down. + Now they will be among the nations, + Like an unwanted vessel. 9 For they have gone up to As·syrʹi·a, + like a lone wild donkey. Eʹphra·im has hired lovers. + 10 Although they hire them from among the nations, I will now round them up; They will begin to suffer + because of the burden imposed by king and princes. 11 For Eʹphra·im has multiplied altars to sin. + They became his altars for sinning. + 12 I wrote for him the many things of my law, * But they were regarded as something strange. + 13 They offer sacrificial gifts to me, and they eat the meat, But Jehovah takes no pleasure in them. + Now he will remember their error and punish them for their sins. + They have turned back * to Egypt. + 14 Israel has forgotten his Maker + and has built temples, + And Judah has multiplied fortified cities. + But I will send fire into his cities, And it will consume the towers of each one.” + Footnotes ^ Or “purity?” ^ Or “standing.” ^ Or “strangers.” ^ Or “instruction.” ^ Or possibly, “They will return.” Previous Next Print Share Share
