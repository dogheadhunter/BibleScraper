So he took one of the stones of that place and set it to rest his head on and lay down there. + 12 Then he had a dream, and look! there was a stairway * set on the earth, and its top reached up to the heavens; and there were God’s angels ascending and descending on it. + 13 And look! there was Jehovah stationed above it, and he said: “I am Jehovah the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. + The land on which you are lying, to you I am going to give it and to your offspring. * + 14 And your offspring * will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, + and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by means of you and by means of your offspring * all the families of the ground will certainly be blessed. * + 15 I am with you, and I will safeguard you wherever you go, and I will return you to this land. + I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” + 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said: “Truly Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it.” 17 And he grew fearful and added: “How awe-inspiring this place is! This can only be the house of God, + and this is the gate of the heavens.” + 18 So Jacob got up early in the morning and took the stone on which he had rested his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. + 19 So he named that place Bethʹel, * but previously the city’s name was Luz. + 20 Jacob then made a vow, saying: “If God will continue with me and will protect me on my journey and will give me bread to eat and garments to wear 21 and I return in peace to the house of my father, then Jehovah will certainly have proved to be my God. 22 And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will become a house of God, + and without fail I will give you a tenth of everything you give to me.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “ladder.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “will obtain a blessing for themselves.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Meaning “House of God.” Previous Next Print Share Share
