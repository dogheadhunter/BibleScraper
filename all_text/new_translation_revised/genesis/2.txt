Bdellium gum and onyx stone are also there. 13 The name of the second river is Giʹhon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is Hidʹde·kel; * + it is the one going to the east of As·syrʹi·a. + And the fourth river is the Eu·phraʹtes. + 15 Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of Eʹden to cultivate it and to take care of it. + 16 Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. + 17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.” + 18 Then Jehovah God said: “It is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” + 19 Now Jehovah God had been forming from the ground every wild animal of the field and every flying creature of the heavens, and he began bringing them to the man to see what he would call each one; and whatever the man would call each living creature, * that became its name. + 20 So the man named all the domestic animals and the flying creatures of the heavens and every wild animal of the field, but for man there was no helper as a complement of him. 21 So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22 And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man. + 23 Then the man said: “This is at last bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, Because from man she was taken.” + 24 That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to * his wife, and they will become one flesh. + 25 And both of them continued to be naked, + the man and his wife; yet they were not ashamed.
