Jehovah has prevented me from bearing children. Please, have relations with my servant. Perhaps I can have children by means of her.” + So Aʹbram listened to what Sarʹai said. 3 After Aʹbram had lived for ten years in the land of Caʹnaan, Aʹbram’s wife Sarʹai took her Egyptian servant Haʹgar and gave her to her husband Aʹbram as his wife. 4 So he had relations with Haʹgar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. 5 At this Sarʹai said to Aʹbram: “The injury done to me is your fault. I was the one who put my servant in your arms, * but when she realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise me. May Jehovah judge between me and you.” 6 So Aʹbram said to Sarʹai: “Look! Your servant is under your authority. Do to her whatever you think is best.” Then Sarʹai humiliated her, and she ran away from her. 7 Later Jehovah’s angel found her at a spring of waters in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. + 8 And he said: “Haʹgar, servant of Sarʹai, where have you come from and where are you going?” To this she said: “I am running away from my mistress Sarʹai.” 9 Jehovah’s angel then said to her: “Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her hand.” 10 Then Jehovah’s angel said: “I will greatly multiply your offspring, * so that they will be too numerous to count.” + 11 Jehovah’s angel added: “Here you are pregnant, and you will give birth to a son, and you must name him Ishʹma·el, * for Jehovah has heard your affliction. 12 He will be a wild donkey * of a man. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him, and he will dwell opposite all his brothers.” * 13 Then she called on the name of Jehovah, who was speaking to her: “You are a God of sight,” + for she said: “Have I here actually looked upon the one who sees me?” 14 That is why the well was called Beʹer-laʹhai-roi. * (It is between Kaʹdesh and Beʹred.) 15 So Haʹgar bore to Aʹbram a son, and Aʹbram named his son, whom Haʹgar bore, Ishʹma·el. + 16 Aʹbram was 86 years old when Haʹgar bore Ishʹma·el to him.
