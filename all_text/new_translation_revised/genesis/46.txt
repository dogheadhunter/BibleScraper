When he arrived at Beʹer-sheʹba, + he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. + 2 Then God spoke to Israel in a vision by night and said: “Jacob, Jacob!” to which he said: “Here I am!” 3 He said: “I am the true God, the God of your father. + Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation. + 4 I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also bring you back from there, + and Joseph will lay his hand on your eyes.” * + 5 After that Jacob departed from Beʹer-sheʹba, and the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharʹaoh had sent to transport him. 6 They took along their herds and their goods, which they had accumulated in the land of Caʹnaan. And so they came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him. 7 He brought with him into Egypt his sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters—all his offspring. 8 Now these are the names of Israel’s sons who came into Egypt, + Jacob and his sons: Jacob’s firstborn was Reuʹben. + 9 The sons of Reuʹben were Haʹnoch, Palʹlu, Hezʹron, and Carʹmi. + 10 The sons of Simʹe·on + were Jem·uʹel, Jaʹmin, Oʹhad, Jaʹchin, Zoʹhar, and Shaʹul + the son of a Caʹnaan·ite woman. 11 The sons of Leʹvi + were Gerʹshon, Koʹhath, and Me·rarʹi. + 12 The sons of Judah + were Er, Oʹnan, Sheʹlah, + Peʹrez, + and Zeʹrah. + However, Er and Oʹnan died in the land of Caʹnaan. + The sons of Peʹrez came to be Hezʹron and Haʹmul. + 13 The sons of Isʹsa·char were Toʹla, Puʹvah, Iob, and Shimʹron. + 14 The sons of Zebʹu·lun + were Seʹred, Eʹlon, and Jahʹle·el. + 15 These are the sons of Leʹah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padʹdan-aʹram, together with his daughter Diʹnah. + All his sons and his daughters * numbered 33. 16 The sons of Gad + were Ziphʹi·on, Hagʹgi, Shuʹni, Ezʹbon, Eʹri, Ar·oʹdi, and A·reʹli. + 17 The sons of Ashʹer + were Imʹnah, Ishʹvah, Ishʹvi, and Be·riʹah, and their sister was Seʹrah. The sons of Be·riʹah were Heʹber and Malʹchi·el. + 18 These are the sons of Zilʹpah, + whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Leʹah. She bore these to Jacob: 16 persons * in all. 19 The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph + and Benjamin. + 20 There were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt Ma·nasʹseh + and Eʹphra·im, + whom Asʹe·nath + the daughter of Pot·iʹphe·ra the priest of On * bore to him. 21 The sons of Benjamin + were Beʹla, Beʹcher, Ashʹbel, Geʹra, + Naʹa·man, Eʹhi, Rosh, Mupʹpim, Hupʹpim, + and Ard. + 22 These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob: 14 persons * in all. 23 The son * of Dan + was Huʹshim. + 24 The sons of Naphʹta·li + were Jahʹze·el, Guʹni, Jeʹzer, and Shilʹlem. + 25 These are the sons of Bilʹhah, whom Laʹban gave to his daughter Rachel. She bore these to Jacob: seven persons * in all. 26 All those * who descended from Jacob and went into Egypt with him, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons, were 66. + 27 Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt were two. * All the people * of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt were 70. + 28 Jacob sent Judah + ahead to tell Joseph that he was on the way to Goʹshen. When they came into the land of Goʹshen, + 29 Joseph had his chariot prepared and went up to meet Israel his father at Goʹshen. When he presented himself to him, he at once embraced him * and wept for some time. * 30 Then Israel said to Joseph: “Now I am ready to die; I have seen your face and know that you are still alive.” 31 Joseph then said to his brothers and to his father’s household: “Let me go up and report to Pharʹaoh + and tell him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household who were in the land of Caʹnaan have come here to me. + 32 The men are shepherds, + and they raise livestock, + and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’ + 33 When Pharʹaoh calls you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ 34 you must say, ‘Your servants have raised livestock from our youth until now, both we and our forefathers,’ + so that you may dwell in the land of Goʹshen, + for every herder of sheep is detestable to the Egyptians.” + Footnotes ^ Or “all who were his.” ^ That is, to close them at Jacob’s death. ^ Or “All the souls of his sons and daughters.” ^ Or “16 souls.” ^ That is, Heliopolis. ^ Or “14 souls.” ^ Lit., “sons.” ^ Or “seven souls.” ^ Or “All the souls.” ^ Or “two souls.” ^ Or “souls.” ^ Lit., “fell upon his neck.” ^ Or “wept on his neck again and again.” Previous Next Print Share Share
