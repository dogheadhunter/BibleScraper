After that Jehovah shut the door behind him. 17 The flooding continued * for 40 days on the earth, and the waters kept increasing and began carrying the ark, and it was floating high above the earth. 18 The waters became overwhelming and kept increasing greatly upon the earth, but the ark floated on the surface of the waters. 19 The waters overwhelmed the earth so greatly that all the tall mountains under the whole heavens were covered. + 20 The waters rose up to 15 cubits * above the mountains. 21 So all living creatures * that were moving on the earth perished + —the flying creatures, the domestic animals, the wild animals, the swarming creatures, and all mankind. + 22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life * in its nostrils died. + 23 So He wiped every living thing from the surface of the earth, including man, animals, creeping animals, and the flying creatures of the sky. They were all wiped off the earth; + only Noah and those with him in the ark survived. + 24 And the waters continued overwhelming the earth for 150 days. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “seven pairs of every clean animal.” ^ Or possibly, “seven pairs of the flying creatures of the sky.” ^ Or “the spirit of life.” ^ Or “kept coming.” ^ A cubit equaled 44.5 cm (17.5 in.).
