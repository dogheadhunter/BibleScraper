He was then dwelling * among the big trees of Mamʹre the Amʹor·ite, + the brother of Eshʹcol and Aʹner. + These men were allies of Aʹbram. 14 Thus Aʹbram heard that his relative * + had been taken captive. With that he mobilized his trained men, 318 servants born in his household, and went in pursuit up to Dan. + 15 During the night, he divided his forces, and he and his servants attacked and defeated them. And he pursued them up to Hoʹbah, which is north of Damascus. 16 He recovered all the goods, and he also recovered Lot his relative, his goods, the women, and the other people. 17 After Aʹbram returned from defeating Ched·or·la·oʹmer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodʹom went out to meet Aʹbram at the Valley * of Shaʹveh, that is, the Valley of the King. + 18 And Mel·chizʹe·dek + king of Saʹlem + brought out bread and wine; he was priest of the Most High God. + 19 Then he blessed him and said: “Blessed be Aʹbram by the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth; 20 And praised be the Most High God, Who has handed your oppressors over to you!” And Aʹbram gave him a tenth of everything. + 21 After that the king of Sodʹom said to Aʹbram: “Give me the people, * but take the goods for yourself.” 22 But Aʹbram said to the king of Sodʹom: “I raise my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God, Maker of heaven and earth, 23 that I will not take anything that is yours, from a thread to a sandal lace, so that you may not say, ‘I made Aʹbram rich.’ 24 I will take nothing except what the young men have already eaten. As for the share of the men who went with me, Aʹner, Eshʹcol, and Mamʹre + —let them take their share.” Footnotes ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ That is, the Dead Sea. ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Or “dwelling in tents.” ^ Lit., “brother.” ^ Or “Low Plain.” ^ Or “souls.” Previous Next Print Share Share
