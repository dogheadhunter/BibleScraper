Hy·me·naeʹus and Phi·leʹtus are among them. + 18 These men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred, + and they are subverting the faith of some. 19 Despite that, the solid foundation of God remains standing, having this seal, “Jehovah * knows those who belong to him,” + and, “Let everyone calling on the name of Jehovah * + renounce unrighteousness.” 20 Now in a large house there are utensils * not only of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for an honorable use but others for a use lacking honor. 21 So if anyone keeps clear of the latter ones, he will be an instrument * for an honorable use, sanctified, useful to his owner, prepared for every good work. 22 So flee from youthful desires, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a clean heart. 23 Further, reject foolish and ignorant debates, + knowing that they produce fights. 24 For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle * toward all, + qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged, + 25 instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed. + Perhaps God may give them repentance * leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, + 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him to do his will. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “gets entangled.” ^ Or possibly, “the everyday activities.” ^ Or “discernment.” ^ Lit., “of David’s seed.” ^ Lit., “bearing thorough witness to.” ^ Or “destroys; overturns.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “vessels.” ^ Or “a utensil; a vessel.” ^ Or “tactful.” ^ Or “a change of mind.” Previous Next Print Share Share
