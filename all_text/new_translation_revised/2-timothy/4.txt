Bring Mark along with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry. 12 But I have sent Tychʹi·cus + off to Ephʹe·sus. 13 When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troʹas with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments. * 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. Jehovah * will repay him according to his deeds. + 15 You too should be on guard against him, for he opposed our message to an excessive degree. 16 In my first defense no one came to my side, but they all forsook me—may they not be held accountable. 17 But the Lord stood near me and infused power into me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the nations might hear it; + and I was rescued from the lion’s mouth. + 18 The Lord will rescue me from every wicked work and will save me for his heavenly Kingdom. + To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 19 Give my greetings to Prisʹca and Aqʹui·la + and the household of On·e·siphʹo·rus. + 20 E·rasʹtus + stayed in Corinth, but I left Trophʹi·mus + sick at Mi·leʹtus. 21 Do your utmost to arrive before winter. Eu·buʹlus sends you his greetings, and so do Puʹdens and Liʹnus and Clauʹdi·a and all the brothers. 22 The Lord be with the spirit you show. His undeserved kindness be with you.
