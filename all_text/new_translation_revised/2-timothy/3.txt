Such men are completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith. 9 Nevertheless, they will make no further progress, for their folly * will be very plain to all, as it was with those two men. + 10 But you have closely followed my teaching, my course of life, + my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, 11 the persecutions and sufferings such as I experienced in Antioch, + in I·coʹni·um, + in Lysʹtra. + I endured these persecutions, and the Lord rescued me from them all. + 12 In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted. + 13 But wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled. + 14 You, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, + knowing from whom you learned them 15 and that from infancy + you have known the holy writings, + which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. + 16 All Scripture is inspired of God + and beneficial for teaching, + for reproving, for setting things straight, * for disciplining in righteousness, + 17 so that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.
