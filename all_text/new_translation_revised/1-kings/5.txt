My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay the wages of your servants according to the rate you set, for you are aware that not one of us knows how to cut trees like the Si·doʹni·ans.” + 7 When Hiʹram heard Solʹo·mon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said: “May Jehovah be praised today, for he has given David a wise son over this great * people!” + 8 So Hiʹram sent word to Solʹo·mon: “I have heard the message you sent to me. I will do all you desire in providing the cedar and juniper timbers. + 9 My servants will bring them down from Lebʹa·non to the sea, and I will make them into log rafts to go by sea to the place that you designate to me. I will have them broken up there, and you can carry them away. In exchange, you will provide the food that I request for my household.” + 10 So Hiʹram supplied all the timbers of cedar and juniper that Solʹo·mon desired. 11 And Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram 20,000 cor measures * of wheat as food supplies for his household and 20 cor measures of very fine olive oil. * That was what Solʹo·mon gave Hiʹram year after year. + 12 And Jehovah gave Solʹo·mon wisdom, just as He had promised him. + And there was peace between Hiʹram and Solʹo·mon, and the two of them made a treaty. * 13 King Solʹo·mon conscripted men for forced labor out of all Israel; 30,000 men were conscripted. + 14 He would send them to Lebʹa·non in shifts of 10,000 each month. They would spend a month in Lebʹa·non and two months at their homes; and Ad·o·niʹram + was over those conscripted for forced labor. 15 Solʹo·mon had 70,000 common laborers * and 80,000 stonecutters + in the mountains, + 16 as well as Solʹo·mon’s 3,300 princely deputies + who served as foremen to supervise the workmen. 17 At the king’s order, they quarried large stones, expensive stones, + to lay the foundation + of the house with hewn stones. + 18 So Solʹo·mon’s builders and Hiʹram’s builders and the Geʹbal·ites + did the cutting, and they prepared the timbers and the stones to build the house.
