Then it can assist those who are truly widows. * + 17 Let the elders who preside in a fine way + be considered worthy of double honor, + especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching. + 18 For the scripture says, “You must not muzzle a bull when it is threshing out the grain,” + also, “The worker is worthy of his wages.” + 19 Do not accept an accusation against an older man * except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. + 20 Reprove + before all onlookers those who practice sin, + as a warning to the rest. * 21 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels to observe these instructions without any prejudice or partiality. + 22 Never lay your hands hastily on any man; * + neither become a sharer in the sins of others; keep yourself chaste. 23 Do not drink water any longer, * but take a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness. 24 The sins of some men are publicly known, leading directly to judgment, but those of other men become evident later. + 25 In the same way also, the fine works are publicly known + and those that are otherwise cannot be kept hidden. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “Honor.” ^ Or “widows who are truly in need”; that is, with no one to support them. ^ Or “commands.” ^ Or “their previous promise.” ^ Or “widows who are truly in need”; that is, with no one to support them. ^ Or “an elder.” ^ Lit., “that the rest may have fear.” ^ That is, do not appoint any man hastily. ^ Or “Stop drinking just water.” Previous Next Print Share Share
