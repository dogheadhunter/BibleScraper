I will sweep away the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea, + And the stumbling blocks * + along with the wicked ones; And I will remove mankind from the surface of the ground,” declares Jehovah. 4 “I will stretch out my hand against Judah And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, And I will wipe out from this place every vestige * of Baʹal, + The name of the foreign-god priests along with the priests, + 5 And those who bow down on the rooftops to the army of the heavens, + And those who bow down and pledge loyalty to Jehovah + While pledging loyalty to Malʹcam; + 6 And those who turn away from following Jehovah + And who do not seek Jehovah or inquire of him.” + 7 Be silent before the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, for the day of Jehovah is near. + Jehovah has prepared a sacrifice; he has sanctified those he invited. 8 “On the day of Jehovah’s sacrifice I will call to account the princes, The sons of the king, + and all those wearing foreign clothing. 9 I will call to account everyone who climbs onto the platform * on that day, Those who fill their master’s house with violence and deception. 10 On that day,” declares Jehovah, “There will be the sound of an outcry from the Fish Gate, + A wailing from the Second Quarter of the city, + And a loud crash from the hills. 11 Wail, you inhabitants of Makʹtesh, * For all the tradesmen * have been done away with; * All those weighing out silver have been destroyed. 12 At that time I will carefully search Jerusalem with lamps, And I will call to account the complacent ones, * who say in their heart, ‘Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do bad.’ + 13 Their wealth will be plundered and their houses will be devastated. + They will build houses, but they will not occupy them; And they will plant vineyards, but they will not drink wine from them. + 14 The great day of Jehovah is near! + It is near and it is approaching very quickly! * + The sound of the day of Jehovah is bitter. + There a warrior cries out. + 15 That day is a day of fury, + A day of distress and anguish, + A day of storm and desolation, A day of darkness and gloom, + A day of clouds and thick gloom, + 16 A day of the horn and of the battle cry, + Against the fortified cities and against the high corner towers. + 17 I will cause distress to mankind, And they will walk like blind men, + Because it is against Jehovah they have sinned. + Their blood will be poured out like dust, And their flesh * like the dung. + 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the day of Jehovah’s fury; + For by the fire of his zeal the whole earth will be consumed, + Because he will make an extermination, indeed a terrible one, of all the inhabitants of the earth.” + Footnotes ^ Meaning “Jehovah Has Concealed (Treasured Up).” ^ Evidently, objects or activities connected with idolatry. ^ Or “trace.” ^ Or “podium; threshold.” Possibly the platform of the king’s throne. ^ Lit., “silenced.” ^ Apparently a section of Jerusalem near the Fish Gate. ^ Or “merchants.” ^ Lit., “those congealing on their dregs,” as in a wine vat. ^ Or “hurrying rapidly!” ^ Lit., “intestines.” Previous Next Print Share Share
