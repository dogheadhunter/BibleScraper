We have sinned, both I and the house of my father. + 7 We have certainly acted corruptly against you + by not keeping the commandments, regulations, and judicial decisions that you gave to your servant Moses. + 8 “Remember, please, the word that you commanded * your servant Moses: ‘If you act unfaithfully, I will scatter you among the peoples. + 9 But if you return to me and observe my commandments and obey them, though your dispersed people should be at the end of the heavens, I will gather them + from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen to have my name reside.’ + 10 They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great power and by your mighty hand. + 11 O Jehovah, please, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants who take delight in fearing your name, and please, grant success to your servant today, and may this man show me compassion.” + Now I was cupbearer to the king. + Footnotes ^ Meaning “Jah Comforts.” ^ See App. B15 . ^ Or “Susa.” ^ Or “palace; fortress.” ^ Or “jurisdictional district.” ^ Or “the warning you gave to.” Previous Next Print Share Share
