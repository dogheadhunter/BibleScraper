And assign the inhabitants of Jerusalem as guards, each to his assigned guardpost and each in front of his own house.” 4 Now the city was spacious and large, and there were few people inside it, + and the houses had not been rebuilt. 5 But my God put it into my heart to gather together the nobles and the deputy rulers and the people to be enrolled genealogically. + Then I found the book of genealogical enrollment of those who first came up, and I found written in it: 6 And these were the people of the province * who came up out of the captivity of the exiles, those whom King Neb·u·chad·nezʹzar + of Babylon had exiled + and who later returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city, + 7 those who came with Ze·rubʹba·bel, + Jeshʹu·a, + Ne·he·miʹah, Az·a·riʹah, Ra·a·miʹah, Na·hamʹa·ni, Morʹde·cai, Bilʹshan, Misʹpe·reth, Bigʹvai, Neʹhum, and Baʹa·nah.
