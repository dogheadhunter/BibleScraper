Follow the ways of your heart and go where your eyes lead you; but know that the true God will bring you into judgment * for all these things. + 10 So remove troublesome things from your heart, and ward off harmful things from your body, * for youth and the prime of life are futility. + Footnotes ^ Or “Send out.” ^ Or “calamity.” ^ Lit., “bones in the womb of.” ^ Or “call you to account.” ^ Lit., “flesh.” Previous Next Print Share Share
