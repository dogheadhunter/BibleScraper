This is futility and a severe affliction. 3 If a man should become a father a hundred times and live for many years and reach old age, yet he * does not enjoy his good things before he reaches the grave, * I must say that a stillborn child is better off than he is. + 4 For this one came in vain and went away in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. 5 Even though he never saw the sun or knew anything, he is still better off * than the former one. + 6 What is the benefit of living a thousand years twice over but not experiencing enjoyment? Do not all go to the same place? + 7 All the hard work of a man is to fill his mouth; + yet his appetite * is never satisfied. 8 For what advantage does the wise one have over the stupid one, + or of what benefit is it that the poor man knows how to survive? * 9 Better to enjoy what the eyes see than to wander after one’s desires. * This too is futility, a chasing after the wind. 10 Whatever has come to be has already been named, and it is known what man is; and he is not able to dispute * with the one more powerful than he. 11 The more words, * the more futility; and what advantage do they bring to man? 12 Who knows what is best for a man to do in life during the few days of his futile life, which he spends like a shadow? + For who can tell man what will happen under the sun after he is gone?
