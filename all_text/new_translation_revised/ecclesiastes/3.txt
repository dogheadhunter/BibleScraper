It is the gift of God. + 14 I have come to know that everything the true God makes will endure forever. There is nothing to add to it and nothing to subtract from it. The true God has made it this way, so that people will fear him. + 15 Whatever happens has already happened, and what is to come has already been; + but the true God seeks what has been pursued. * 16 I have also seen this under the sun: In the place of justice there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there was wickedness. + 17 So I said in my heart: “The true God will judge both the righteous and the wicked, + for there is a time for every activity and every action.” 18 I also said in my heart about the sons of men that the true God will test them and show them that they are like animals, 19 for there is an outcome * for humans and an outcome for animals; they all have the same outcome. + As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit. + So man has no superiority over animals, for everything is futile. 20 All are going to the same place. + They all come from the dust, + and they all are returning to the dust. + 21 Who really knows whether the spirit of humans ascends upward, and whether the spirit of animals descends down to the earth? + 22 And I saw that there is nothing better than for a man to find enjoyment in his work, + because that is his reward; * for who can enable him to see what will happen after he is gone? + Footnotes ^ Lit., “leap; skip about.” ^ Or “well-arranged; proper; appropriate.” ^ Or possibly, “what has passed away.” ^ Or “eventuality.” ^ Or “portion.” Previous Next Print Share Share
