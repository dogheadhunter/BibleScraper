But wisdom helps to achieve success. 11 If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the skilled charmer. * 12 The words from the mouth of the wise one bring favor, + but the lips of the stupid one are his ruin. + 13 The first words out of his mouth are foolishness, + and his last words are disastrous madness. 14 But the fool keeps on speaking. + A man does not know what will happen; who can tell him what will come after him? + 15 The hard work of the stupid one wears him out, for he does not even know how to find his way to the city. 16 How terrible for a land when the king is a boy + and the princes start their feasting in the morning! 17 How happy for the land when the king is the son of nobles and the princes eat at the proper time for strength, not for drunkenness! + 18 Because of extreme laziness the roof beams sag, and because of idle hands the house leaks. + 19 Bread * is made for laughter, and wine makes life enjoyable; + but money answers every need. + 20 Even in your thoughts, * do not curse * the king, + and do not curse the rich in your bedroom; for a bird * may convey the sound, * or a creature with wings may repeat what was said.
