In fact, whatever I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) has been for your sake in Christ’s sight, 11 so that we may not be overreached * by Satan, + for we are not ignorant of his designs. * + 12 Now when I arrived in Troʹas + to declare the good news about the Christ and a door was opened to me in the Lord, 13 my spirit felt no relief because of not finding Titus + my brother. So I said good-bye to them and departed for Mac·e·doʹni·a. + 14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in a triumphal procession in company with the Christ and through us spreads * the fragrance of the knowledge of him in every place! 15 For to God we are a sweet fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing; 16 to the latter ones an odor * of death leading to death, + to the former ones a fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequately qualified for these things? 17 We are, for we are not peddlers of * the word of God + as many men are, but we speak in all sincerity as sent from God, yes, in the sight of God and in company with Christ.
