Or do we need, like some men, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 2 You yourselves are our letter, + inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind. 3 For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers, + inscribed not with ink but with the spirit of a living God, not on stone tablets + but on fleshly tablets, on hearts. + 4 We have this sort of confidence toward God through the Christ. 5 Not that we of ourselves are adequately qualified to consider that anything comes from us, but our being adequately qualified comes from God, + 6 who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, + not of a written code, + but of spirit; for the written code condemns to death, + but the spirit makes alive. + 7 Now if the code that administers death and that was engraved in letters on stones + came with such glory that the sons of Israel could not gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, + a glory that was to be done away with, 8 why should the administering of the spirit + not be with even greater glory? + 9 For if the code administering condemnation + was glorious, + how much more glorious would be the administering of righteousness! + 10 In fact, even what had once been made glorious has been stripped of glory because of the glory that excels it. + 11 For if what was to be done away with was brought in with glory, + how much greater would be the glory of what remains! + 12 Since we have such a hope, + we are using great freeness of speech, 13 and not doing what Moses did when he would put a veil over his face + so that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of what was to be done away with. 14 But their minds were dulled. + For to this present day, the same veil remains unlifted when the old covenant is read, + because it is taken away only by means of Christ. + 15 In fact, to this day whenever Moses is read, + a veil lies upon their hearts. + 16 But when one turns to Jehovah, * the veil is taken away. + 17 Now Jehovah * is the Spirit, + and where the spirit of Jehovah * is, there is freedom. + 18 And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, * are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, * exactly as it is done by Jehovah * the Spirit. * + Footnotes ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ Lit., “from glory to glory.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or possibly, “by the spirit of Jehovah.” Previous Next Print Share Share
