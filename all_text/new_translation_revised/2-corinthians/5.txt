However, I hope that we are well-known * also to your consciences. 12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again but giving you an incentive to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast over the outward appearance + but not over what is in the heart. 13 For if we were out of our mind, + it was for God; if we are sound in mind, it is for you. 14 For the love the Christ has compels us, because this is what we have concluded, that one man died for all; + so, then, all had died. 15 And he died for all so that those who live should live no longer for themselves, + but for him who died for them and was raised up. 16 So from now on we know no man from a fleshly viewpoint. + Even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, we certainly no longer know him in that way. + 17 Therefore, if anyone is in union with Christ, he is a new creation; + the old things passed away; look! new things have come into existence. 18 But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ + and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation, + 19 namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, + not counting their offenses against them, + and he entrusted to us the message of the reconciliation. + 20 Therefore, we are ambassadors + substituting for Christ, + as though God were making an appeal through us. As substitutes for Christ, we beg: “Become reconciled to God.” 21 The one who did not know sin, + he made to be sin * for us, so that by means of him we might become God’s righteousness. + Footnotes ^ Or “dissolved.” ^ Or “dwelling.” ^ Or “to put on our dwelling that is.” ^ Or “our heavenly dwelling.” ^ Or “a down payment (earnest money); a guarantee (pledge) of what is to come.” ^ Or “be made manifest.” ^ Or “vile.” ^ Or “manifest.” ^ Or “manifest.” ^ Or “a sin offering.” Previous Next Print Share Share
