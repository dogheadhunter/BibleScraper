Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation. 3 In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, so that no fault may be found with our ministry; + 4 but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers, + by the endurance of much, by tribulations, by times of need, by difficulties, + 5 by beatings, by imprisonments, + by riots, by hard work, by sleepless nights, by times without food; + 6 by purity, by knowledge, by patience, + by kindness, + by holy spirit, by love free from hypocrisy, + 7 by truthful speech, by God’s power; + through the weapons of righteousness + in the right hand * and in the left, * 8 through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report. We are regarded as deceivers and yet we are truthful, 9 as unknown and yet we are recognized, as dying * and yet look! we live, + as punished * and yet not handed over to death, + 10 as sorrowing but ever rejoicing, as poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things. + 11 We have opened our mouth to speak * to you, Corinthians, and we have opened wide our heart. 12 We are not restricted in * our affections for you, + but you are restricted in your own tender affections for us. 13 So in response—I speak as to my children—you too open your hearts wide. * + 14 Do not become unevenly yoked * with unbelievers. + For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? + Or what sharing does light have with darkness? + 15 Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Beʹli·al? * + Or what does a believer * share in common * with an unbeliever? + 16 And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols? + For we are a temple of a living God; + just as God said: “I will reside among them + and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” + 17 “‘Therefore, get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, * ‘and quit touching the unclean thing’”; + “‘and I will take you in.’” + 18 “‘And I will become a father to you, + and you will become sons and daughters to me,’ + says Jehovah, * the Almighty.” Footnotes ^ Perhaps for defense. ^ Perhaps for offense. ^ Or “considered worthy of death.” ^ Or “disciplined.” ^ Or “have spoken openly.” ^ Or “cramped for room in.” ^ Or “you too widen out.” ^ Or “joined.” ^ Or “what share does a believer have.” ^ Or “a faithful person.” ^ From a Hebrew word meaning “Good for Nothing.” A reference to Satan. ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 .
