38 From the mouth of the Most High, Bad things and good things do not go out together. 39 Why should a living person complain about the consequences of his sin? + נ [ Nun ] 40 Let us examine and scrutinize our ways, + and let us return to Jehovah. + 41 Let us lift up our hearts along with our hands to God in the heavens: + 42 “We have transgressed and rebelled, + and you have not forgiven. + ס [ Samekh ] 43 With anger you have blocked our approach; + You have pursued and killed us without compassion. + 44 You have blocked approach to yourself with a cloud, so that our prayer may not pass through. + 45 You make us offscouring and refuse among the peoples.” פ [ Pe ] 46 All our enemies open their mouths against us. + 47 Dread and pitfalls have become our lot, + desolation and breakdown. + 48 Streams of water flow from my eyes over the breakdown of the daughter of my people. + ע [ Ayin ] 49 My eyes weep without ceasing, without pausing, + 50 Until Jehovah looks down and sees from heaven. + 51 My eyes have brought me * grief because of all the daughters of my city. + צ [ Tsade ] 52 Without cause my enemies have hunted me down like a bird. 53 They have silenced my life in the pit; they kept hurling stones at me. 54 Waters flowed over my head, and I said: “I am finished!” ק [ Qoph ] 55 I called out your name, O Jehovah, from the depths of the pit. + 56 Hear my voice; do not shut your ear to my cry for help, for relief. 57 You drew near in the day that I called you. You said: “Do not be afraid.” ר [ Resh ] 58 You have defended my cause, * O Jehovah, you have redeemed my life. + 59 You have seen, O Jehovah, the wrong done to me; please grant me justice. + 60 You have seen all their vengeance, all their schemes against me. ש [ Sin ] or [ Shin ] 61 You have heard their taunts, O Jehovah, all their schemes against me, + 62 The lips of my opposers and their whispering against me all day long. 63 Look at them; whether they sit or stand, they mock me in their songs! ת [ Taw ] 64 You will repay them, O Jehovah, according to their deeds. 65 You will make them hardhearted, as your curse to them. 66 You will pursue them in your anger and annihilate them from under the heavens of Jehovah.
