He is causing a complete extermination. Distress will not arise a second time. + 10 For they are interwoven like thorns, And they are like those drunk with beer; * But they will be consumed like dry stubble. 11 From you will come one who plots evil against Jehovah, Giving worthless advice. 12 This is what Jehovah says: “Though they were at full strength and numerous, Even so they will be cut down and will pass away. * I have afflicted you, * but I will afflict you no more. 13 And now I will break his yoke bar from off you, + And I will tear your bonds in two. 14 Jehovah has commanded concerning you, * ‘Your name will not be perpetuated further. I will do away with the carved images and metal statues * from the house * of your gods. I will make a grave for you, because you are contemptible.’ 15 Look! On the mountains are the feet of one bringing good news, The one proclaiming peace. + Celebrate your festivals, + O Judah, pay your vows, For the worthless one will never pass through you again. He will be utterly destroyed.” Footnotes ^ Meaning “Comforter.” ^ Or “takes care of.” Lit., “knows.” ^ That is, Nineveh’s. ^ Or “wheat beer.” ^ Or possibly, “and he will pass through.” ^ That is, Judah. ^ That is, Assyria. ^ Or “molten statues.” ^ Or “temple.” Previous Next Print Share Share
