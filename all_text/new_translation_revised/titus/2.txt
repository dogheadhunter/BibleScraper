Teach what is pure * with all seriousness, + 8 using wholesome * speech that cannot be criticized, + so that those who oppose may be put to shame, having nothing negative * to say about us. + 9 Let slaves be in subjection to their owners in all things, + trying to please them, not talking back, 10 not stealing from them, + but showing complete trustworthiness, so that in every way they may adorn the teaching of our Savior, God. + 11 For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people. + 12 It trains us to reject ungodliness and worldly desires + and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things, * + 13 while we wait for the happy hope + and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior, Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us + to set us free * + from every sort of lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people who are his own special possession, zealous for fine works. + 15 Keep on speaking these things and exhorting * and reproving with full authority. + Do not let anyone look down on you.
