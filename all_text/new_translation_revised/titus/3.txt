These things are fine and beneficial to men. 9 But have nothing to do with foolish arguments and genealogies and disputes and fights over the Law, for they are unprofitable and futile. + 10 As for a man who promotes a sect, + reject him + after a first and a second admonition, * + 11 knowing that such a man has deviated from the way and is sinning and is self-condemned. 12 When I send Arʹte·mas or Tychʹi·cus + to you, do your utmost to come to me at Ni·copʹo·lis, for that is where I have decided to spend the winter. 13 Carefully supply Zeʹnas, who is versed in the Law, and A·polʹlos so that they may lack nothing for their trip. + 14 But let our people also learn to maintain fine works so as to help in cases of urgent need, + so that they may not be unproductive. * + 15 All those with me send you their greetings. Give my greetings to those who have affection for us in the faith. May the undeserved kindness be with all of you.
