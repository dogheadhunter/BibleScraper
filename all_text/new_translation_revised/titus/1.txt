For this very reason, keep on reproving them with severity so that they may be healthy in the faith, 14 paying no attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. 15 All things are clean to clean people; + but to those who are defiled and faithless, nothing is clean, for both their minds and their consciences are defiled. + 16 They publicly declare that they know God, but they disown him by their works, + because they are detestable and disobedient and not approved for good work of any sort.
