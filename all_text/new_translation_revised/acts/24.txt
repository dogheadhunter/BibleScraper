But there were some Jews from the province of Asia 19 who ought to be present before you to accuse me if they actually have anything against me. + 20 Or let the men here say for themselves what wrong they found as I stood before the Sanʹhe·drin, 21 except for this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: ‘Over the resurrection of the dead I am today being judged before you!’” + 22 However, Felix, knowing quite well the facts concerning this Way, + began to put them off and say: “Whenever Lysʹi·as the military commander comes down, I will decide these matters involving you.” 23 And he gave orders to the army officer that the man be kept under arrest but given some freedom, and that his people be allowed to attend to his needs. 24 Some days later Felix came with Dru·silʹla his wife, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and listened to him speak about the belief in Christ Jesus. + 25 But as Paul talked about righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, + Felix became frightened and answered: “Go away for now, but when I have an opportunity I will send for you again.” 26 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would give him money. For that reason, he sent for him even more frequently and conversed with him. 27 But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and because Felix desired to gain favor with the Jews, + he left Paul in custody.
