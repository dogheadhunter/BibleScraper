This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will come in the same manner as you have seen him going into the sky.” 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem + from a mountain called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, only a sabbath day’s journey away. 13 When they arrived, they went up into the upper room where they were staying. There were Peter as well as John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bar·tholʹo·mew and Matthew, James the son of Al·phaeʹus, and Simon the zealous one, and Judas the son of James. + 14 With one purpose all of these were persisting in prayer, together with some women + and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brothers. + 15 During those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (the number * of people was altogether about 120) and said: 16 “Men, brothers, it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the holy spirit spoke prophetically through David about Judas, + who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. + 17 For he had been numbered among us + and he obtained a share in this ministry. 18 (This very man, therefore, purchased a field with the wages for unrighteousness, + and falling headfirst, his body burst open * and all his insides spilled out. + 19 This became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language A·kelʹda·ma, that is, “Field of Blood.”) 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his dwelling become desolate, and let there be no inhabitant in it’ + and, ‘His office of oversight let someone else take.’ + 21 It is therefore necessary that of the men who accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus carried on his activities * among us, 22 starting with his baptism by John + until the day he was taken up from us, + one of these men should become a witness with us of his resurrection.” + 23 So they proposed two, Joseph called Barʹsab·bas, who was also called Justus, and Mat·thiʹas. 24 Then they prayed and said: “You, O Jehovah, * who know the hearts of all, + designate which one of these two men you have chosen 25 to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas deviated to go to his own place.” + 26 So they cast lots over them, + and the lot fell to Mat·thiʹas, and he was counted * along with the 11 apostles.
