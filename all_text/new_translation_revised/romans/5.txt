For if by one man’s trespass many died, how much more did the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift by the undeserved kindness of the one man, + Jesus Christ, abound * to many! + 16 Also, it is not the same with the free gift as with the way things worked through the one man who sinned. + For the judgment after one trespass was condemnation, + but the gift after many trespasses was a declaration of righteousness. + 17 For if by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king through that one, + how much more will those who receive the abundance of the undeserved kindness and of the free gift of righteousness + rule as kings + in life through the one person, Jesus Christ! + 18 So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all sorts was condemnation, + so too through one act of justification the result to men of all sorts + is their being declared righteous for life. + 19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, + so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous. + 20 Now the Law came on the scene so that trespassing might increase. + But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more. 21 To what end? So that just as sin ruled as king with death, + so also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness leading to everlasting life through Jesus Christ our Lord. + Footnotes ^ Or possibly, “we have peace.” ^ Or possibly, “we rejoice.” ^ Or possibly, “we rejoice.” ^ Or “overflow.” Previous Next Print Share Share
