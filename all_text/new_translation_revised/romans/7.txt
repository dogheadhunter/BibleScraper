Is the Law sin? Certainly not! Really, I would not have come to know sin had it not been for the Law. + For example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said: “You must not covet.” + 8 But sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every sort, for apart from law sin was dead. + 9 In fact, I was once alive apart from law. But when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died. + 10 And the commandment that was to lead to life, + this I found led to death. 11 For sin, finding the opportunity afforded by the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it. 12 So the Law in itself is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. + 13 Therefore, did what is good result in my death? Certainly not! But sin did, that it might be shown to be sin working out death in me through what is good, + so that through the commandment sin might become far more sinful. + 14 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin. + 15 For I do not understand what I am doing. For I do not practice what I wish, but I do what I hate. 16 However, if I do what I do not wish, I agree that the Law is fine. 17 But now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is the sin that resides in me. + 18 For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good; for I have the desire to do what is fine but not the ability to carry it out. + 19 For I do not do the good that I wish, but the bad that I do not wish is what I practice. 20 If, then, I do what I do not wish, I am no longer the one carrying it out, but it is the sin dwelling in me. 21 I find, then, this law in my case: When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. + 22 I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, + 23 but I see in my body * another law warring against the law of my mind + and leading me captive to sin’s law + that is in my body. * 24 Miserable man that I am! Who will rescue me from the body undergoing this death? 25 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with my flesh to sin’s law. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “members.” ^ Lit., “members.” ^ Lit., “members.” Previous Next Print Share Share
