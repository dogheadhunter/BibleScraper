Amen. 26 That is why God gave them over to disgraceful sexual passion, + for their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; + 27 likewise also the males left the natural use of * the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, + working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full penalty, * which was due for their error. + 28 Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God, * God gave them over to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting. + 29 And they were filled with all unrighteousness, + wickedness, greed, * + and badness, being full of envy, + murder, + strife, deceit, + and malice, + being whisperers, * 30 backbiters, + haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, schemers of what is harmful, * disobedient to parents, + 31 without understanding, + false to agreements, having no natural affection, and merciless. 32 Although these know full well the righteous decree of God—that those practicing such things are deserving of death + —they not only keep on doing them but also approve of those practicing them.
