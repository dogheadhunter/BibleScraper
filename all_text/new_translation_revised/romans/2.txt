You, the one abhorring idols, do you rob temples? 23 You who take pride in law, do you dishonor God by your transgressing of the Law? 24 For “the name of God is being blasphemed among the nations because of you,” just as it is written. + 25 Circumcision + is, in fact, of benefit only if you practice law; + but if you are a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. 26 If, therefore, an uncircumcised person + keeps the righteous requirements of the Law, his uncircumcision will be counted as circumcision, will it not? + 27 And the physically uncircumcised person will, by carrying out the Law, judge you who are a transgressor of law despite having its written code and circumcision. 28 For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, + nor is circumcision something on the outside, on the flesh. + 29 But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, + and his circumcision is that of the heart + by spirit and not by a written code. + That person’s praise comes from God, not from people. + Footnotes ^ Or “tolerance.” ^ Or “the soul of every man.” ^ Lit., “between.” ^ Or “orally instructed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
