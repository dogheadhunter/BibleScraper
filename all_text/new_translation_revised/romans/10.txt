How, in turn, will they put faith in him about whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? 15 How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent out? + Just as it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!” + 16 Nevertheless, they did not all obey the good news. For Isaiah says: “Jehovah, * who has put faith in the thing heard from us?” * + 17 So faith follows the thing heard. + In turn, what is heard is through the word about Christ. 18 But I ask, They did not fail to hear, did they? Why, in fact, “into all the earth their sound went out, and to the ends of the inhabited earth their message.” + 19 But I ask, Israel did not fail to know, did they? + First Moses says: “I will incite you to jealousy through that which is not a nation; I will incite you to violent anger through a foolish nation.” + 20 But Isaiah becomes very bold and says: “I was found by those who were not seeking me; + I became known to those who were not asking for me.” + 21 But he says regarding Israel: “All day long I have spread out my hands toward a disobedient and obstinate people.” + Footnotes ^ Or “generous.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “in our report?” Previous Next Print Share Share
