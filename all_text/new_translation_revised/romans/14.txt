For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. + 11 For it is written: “‘As surely as I live,’ + says Jehovah, * ‘to me every knee will bend, and every tongue will make open acknowledgment to God.’” + 12 So, then, each of us will render an account for himself to God. + 13 Therefore, let us not judge one another any longer + but, rather, be determined not to put a stumbling block or an obstacle before a brother. + 14 I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; + only where a man considers something to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 15 For if your brother is being offended because of food, you are no longer walking according to love. + Do not by your food ruin * that one for whom Christ died. + 16 Therefore, do not let the good you do be spoken of as bad. 17 For the Kingdom of God does not mean eating and drinking, + but means righteousness and peace and joy with holy spirit. 18 For whoever slaves for Christ in this way is acceptable to God and has approval with men. 19 So, then, let us pursue the things making for peace + and the things that build one another up. + 20 Stop tearing down the work of God just for the sake of food. + True, all things are clean, but it is detrimental for * a man to eat when it will cause stumbling. + 21 It is best not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything over which your brother stumbles. + 22 The faith that you have, keep it to yourself before God. Happy is the man who does not judge himself by what he approves. 23 But if he has doubts, he is already condemned if he eats, because he does not eat based on faith. Indeed, everything that is not based on faith is sin.
