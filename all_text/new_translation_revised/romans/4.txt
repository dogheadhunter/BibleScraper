When he was circumcised or uncircumcised? He was not yet circumcised but was uncircumcised. 11 And he received a sign + —namely, circumcision—as a seal * of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, so that he might be the father of all those having faith + while uncircumcised, in order for righteousness to be counted to them; 12 and so that he might be a father to circumcised offspring, not only to those who adhere to circumcision but also to those who walk orderly in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham + had while in the uncircumcised state. 13 For it was not through law that Abraham or his offspring * had the promise that he should be heir of a world, + but it was through righteousness by faith. + 14 For if those who adhere to law are heirs, faith becomes useless and the promise has been abolished. 15 In reality the Law produces wrath, + but where there is no law, neither is there any transgression. + 16 That is why it is through faith, so that it might be according to undeserved kindness, + in order for the promise to be sure to all his offspring, * + not only to those who adhere to the Law but also to those who adhere to the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. + 17 (This is just as it is written: “I have appointed you a father of many nations.”) + This was in the sight of God, in whom he had faith, who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are. * 18 Although beyond hope, yet based on hope, he had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said: “So your offspring * will be.” + 19 And although he did not grow weak in faith, he considered his own body, now as good as dead (since he was about 100 years old), + as well as the deadness * of the womb of Sarah. + 20 But because of the promise of God, he did not waver in a lack of faith; but he became powerful by his faith, giving God glory 21 and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do. + 22 Therefore, “it was counted to him as righteousness.” + 23 However, the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake only, + 24 but also for our sake, to whom it will be counted, because we believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord up from the dead. + 25 He was handed over for the sake of our trespasses + and was raised up for the sake of declaring us righteous. + Footnotes ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “as a debt.” ^ Or “forgiven.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “guarantee; confirmation.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or possibly, “calls into existence what does not exist.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “barrenness.” Previous Next Print Share Share
