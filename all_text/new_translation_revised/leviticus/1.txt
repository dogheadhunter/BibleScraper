It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing * aroma to Jehovah. 14 “‘However, if he offers birds as a burnt offering to Jehovah, he will present his offering from the turtledoves or the young pigeons. + 15 The priest will present it at the altar and nip off its head and make it smoke on the altar, but its blood should be drained out on the side of the altar. 16 He should remove its crop and its feathers and throw them beside the altar, to the east, to the place for the ashes. * + 17 He will split it at its wings without dividing it into two parts. Then the priest will make it smoke on the altar over the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire of a pleasing * aroma to Jehovah.
