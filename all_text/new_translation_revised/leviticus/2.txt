Along with every offering of yours, you will present salt. + 14 “‘If you present the grain offering of the first ripe fruits to Jehovah, you should present new grain * roasted with fire, coarsely crushed new kernels, as the grain offering of your first ripe fruits. + 15 You are to put oil on it and place frankincense on it. It is a grain offering. 16 The priest will make it smoke as a token offering, * + that is, some of the coarse grain and oil along with all its frankincense, as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.
