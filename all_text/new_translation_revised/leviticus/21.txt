He should be holy to you, because I, Jehovah, the one sanctifying you, am holy. + 9 “‘Now if the daughter of a priest should profane herself by committing prostitution, she is profaning her father. She should be burned in the fire. + 10 “‘The high priest of his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil is poured + and who has been installed * to wear the priestly garments, + should not let his head go ungroomed or tear his garments. + 11 He should not approach any dead person; * + he may not defile himself even for his father or his mother. 12 He should not go out from the sanctuary and should not profane the sanctuary of his God, + for the sign of dedication, the anointing oil of his God, + is upon him. I am Jehovah. 13 “‘He must take as a wife a woman who is a virgin. + 14 He may not marry a widow, a divorced woman, one who has been defiled, or a prostitute; but he should take a virgin from his people as a wife. 15 He should not profane his offspring * among his people, + for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying him.’” 16 Jehovah continued to speak to Moses, saying: 17 “Tell Aaron, ‘No man of your offspring * throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to present the bread of his God. 18 If there is any man who has a defect, he may not approach: a man who is blind or lame or has a disfigured face * or one limb too long, 19 a man with a fractured foot or a fractured hand, 20 a hunchback or a dwarf, * or a man with an eye defect or eczema or ringworm or damaged testicles. + 21 No man of the offspring * of Aaron the priest who has a defect may approach to present Jehovah’s offerings made by fire. Because he has a defect, he may not approach to present the bread of his God. 22 He may eat the bread of his God from the most holy things + and from the holy things. + 23 However, he may not come near the curtain, + and he may not approach the altar, + because there is a defect in him; and he should not profane my sanctuary, + for I am Jehovah, who is sanctifying them.’” + 24 So Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites.
