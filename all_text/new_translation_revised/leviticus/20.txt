Their own blood is upon them. 12 If a man lies down with his daughter-in-law, both of them should be put to death without fail. They have violated what is natural. Their own blood is upon them. + 13 “‘If a man lies down with a male the same as one lies down with a woman, both of them have done a detestable thing. + They should be put to death without fail. Their own blood is upon them. 14 “‘If a man takes a woman and her mother, it is an obscene act. * + They should burn him and them in the fire, + so that obscene conduct may not continue among you. 15 “‘If a man has intercourse with a beast, he should be put to death without fail, and you should kill the beast. + 16 If a woman approaches any beast to have intercourse with it, + you must kill the woman and the beast. They should be put to death without fail. Their own blood is upon them. 17 “‘If a man has sexual relations with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother, and he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace. + They must be cut off * before the eyes of the sons of their people. He has exposed his sister to shame. * He should answer for his error. 18 “‘If a man lies down with a menstruating woman and has sexual relations with her, both he and she have exposed her flow of blood. + Both of them must be cut off * from among their people. 19 “‘You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, because that would be exposing a blood relative to shame. + They should answer for their error. 20 A man who lies down with his uncle’s wife has exposed his uncle to shame. * + They should answer for their sin. They should die childless. 21 If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is something abhorrent. + He has exposed his brother to shame. * They should become childless. 22 “‘You must keep all my statutes and all my judicial decisions + and carry them out, + so that the land where I am bringing you to dwell will not vomit you out. + 23 You must not walk in the statutes of the nations that I am driving out from before you; + for they have done all these things and I abhor them. + 24 That is why I said to you: “You will take possession of their land, and I will give it to you as your possession, a land flowing with milk and honey. + Jehovah your God I am, who has set you apart from the peoples.” + 25 You must make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean and between the unclean bird and the clean; + you must not make yourselves * loathsome by means of an animal or a bird or anything that creeps on the ground that I set apart for you to regard as unclean. + 26 You must be holy to me, because I, Jehovah, am holy, + and I am setting you apart from the peoples to become mine. + 27 “‘Any man or woman who acts as a spirit medium or is a fortune-teller * should be put to death without fail. + The people should stone them to death. Their own blood is upon them.’” Footnotes ^ Or “put him to death.” ^ Or “put to death.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “put him to death.” ^ Or “calls down evil upon.” ^ Lit., “his father’s nakedness.” ^ Or “shameful conduct; lewdness.” ^ Or “put to death.” ^ Lit., “his sister’s nakedness.” ^ Or “put to death.” ^ Lit., “his uncle’s nakedness.” ^ Lit., “his brother’s nakedness.” ^ Or “your souls.” ^ Or “has a spirit of prediction.” Previous Next Print Share Share
