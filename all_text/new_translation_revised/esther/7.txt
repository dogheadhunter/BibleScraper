It will be granted you. And what is your request? Even to * the half of my kingdom, it will be done!” + 3 Queen Esther answered: “If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life * be granted as my petition, and my people + as my request. 4 For we have been sold, + I and my people, to be annihilated, killed, and destroyed. + If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept silent. But the distress is not proper, for it will be damaging to the king.” 5 King A·has·u·eʹrus then said to Queen Esther: “Who is this, and where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?” 6 Esther said: “The adversary and enemy is this evil Haʹman.” Haʹman became terrified because of the king and the queen. 7 The king rose up in a rage from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden, but Haʹman stood up to plead with Queen Esther for his life, * for he realized that the king was determined to punish him. 8 The king returned from the palace garden to the house of the wine banquet and saw that Haʹman had thrown himself on the couch where Esther was. The king exclaimed: “Is he also going to rape the queen in my own house?” As soon as these words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haʹman’s face. 9 Har·boʹna, + one of the king’s court officials, now said: “Haʹman also prepared a stake for Morʹde·cai, + whose report saved the king. + It is standing at Haʹman’s house, 50 cubits * high.” At that the king said: “Hang him on it.” 10 So they hanged Haʹman on the stake that he had prepared for Morʹde·cai, and the king’s rage subsided.
