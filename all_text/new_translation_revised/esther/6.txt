They should call out before him: ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!’” + 10 At once the king said to Haʹman: “Quick! Take the attire and the horse, and do what you just said for Morʹde·cai the Jew who is sitting in the king’s gate. Do not leave out anything that you have said.” 11 So Haʹman took the attire and the horse, and he clothed Morʹde·cai + and made him ride in the public square of the city and called out before him: “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honor!” 12 Afterward Morʹde·cai returned to the king’s gate, but Haʹman hurried to his house, mourning with his head covered. 13 When Haʹman related to his wife Zeʹresh + and to all his friends everything that had happened to him, his wise men and his wife Zeʹresh said to him: “If Morʹde·cai, before whom you have started to fall, is of Jewish descent, * you will not prevail against him; you will surely fall before him.” 14 While they were still speaking with him, the king’s court officials arrived and quickly took Haʹman to the banquet that Esther had made. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the king’s sleep fled.” ^ Lit., “to lay hand on.” ^ Or “palace.” ^ Lit., “from the seed of the Jews.” Previous Next Print Share Share
