They quickly turned aside from the way in which their forefathers had walked, those who had obeyed the commandments of Jehovah. + They failed to do that. 18 Whenever Jehovah did raise up judges for them, + Jehovah would be with the judge and save them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for Jehovah was moved to pity * + over their groaning caused by those who oppressed them + and those who were treating them abusively. 19 But when the judge died, they would again act more corruptly than their fathers by following other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. + They did not abandon their practices and their stubborn behavior. 20 Finally Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel, + and he said: “Because this nation has violated my covenant + that I commanded their forefathers and they have disobeyed me, + 21 I for my part will not drive out from before them even one of the nations that Joshua left behind when he died. + 22 This is to test whether Israel will keep Jehovah’s way + by walking in it as their fathers did.” 23 So Jehovah allowed these nations to remain. He did not drive them out quickly, and he did not give them into Joshua’s hand.
