Therefore, be sound in mind, + and be vigilant * with a view to prayers. + 8 Above all things, have intense love for one another, + because love covers a multitude of sins. + 9 Be hospitable to one another without grumbling. + 10 To the extent that each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as fine stewards of God’s undeserved kindness that is expressed in various ways. + 11 If anyone speaks, let him do so as speaking pronouncements from God; if anyone ministers, let him do so as depending on the strength that God supplies; + so that in all things God may be glorified + through Jesus Christ. The glory and the might are his forever and ever. Amen. 12 Beloved ones, do not be surprised about the fiery trials that you are experiencing, + as though something strange were happening to you. 13 On the contrary, go on rejoicing + over the extent to which you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, + so that you may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory. + 14 If you are being reproached * for the name of Christ, you are happy, + because the spirit of glory, yes, the spirit of God, is resting upon you. 15 However, let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or a wrongdoer or a busybody in other people’s matters. + 16 But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, + but let him keep on glorifying God while bearing this name. 17 For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. + Now if it starts first with us, + what will the outcome be for those who are not obedient to the good news of God? + 18 “And if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, what will happen to the ungodly man and the sinner?” + 19 So, then, let those who are suffering in harmony with the will of God keep on entrusting * themselves * to a faithful Creator while they are doing good. + Footnotes ^ Or “resolve; determination.” ^ Or “acts of shameless conduct.” Plural of the Greek a·selʹgei·a.
