He will make you firm, + he will make you strong, + he will firmly ground you. 11 To him be the might forever. Amen. 12 Through Sil·vaʹnus, * + whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written you in few words in order to encourage you and to give an earnest witness that this is the true undeserved kindness of God. Stand firm in it. 13 She who is in Babylon, a chosen one like you, sends you her greetings, and so does Mark, + my son. 14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. May all of you who are in union with Christ have peace.
