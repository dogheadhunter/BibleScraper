I am laying in Zion a chosen stone, a precious foundation cornerstone, and no one exercising faith in it will ever be disappointed.” * + 7 It is to you, therefore, that he is precious, because you are believers; but to those not believing, “the stone that the builders rejected, + this has become the chief cornerstone” * + 8 and “a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.” + They are stumbling because they are disobedient to the word. To this very end they were appointed. 9 But you are “a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, + a people for special possession, + that you should declare abroad the excellencies” * + of the One who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. + 10 For you were once not a people, but now you are God’s people; + once you had not been shown mercy, but now you have received mercy. + 11 Beloved, I urge you as foreigners and temporary residents + to keep abstaining from fleshly desires, + which wage war against you. * + 12 Maintain your conduct fine among the nations, + so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers, they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works + and, as a result, glorify God in the day of his inspection. 13 For the Lord’s sake subject yourselves to every human creation, * + whether to a king + as being superior 14 or to governors as sent by him to punish wrongdoers but to praise those who do good. + 15 For it is the will of God that by doing good you may silence * the ignorant talk of unreasonable men. + 16 Be as free people, + using your freedom, not as a cover * for doing wrong, + but as slaves of God. + 17 Honor men of all sorts, + have love for the whole association of brothers, * + be in fear of God, + honor the king. + 18 Let servants be in subjection to their masters with all due fear, + not only to the good and reasonable but also to those hard to please. 19 For it is agreeable when someone endures hardship * and suffers unjustly because of conscience toward God. + 20 For what merit is there if you are beaten for sinning and you endure it? + But if you endure suffering because of doing good, this is an agreeable thing to God. + 21 In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, + leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely. + 22 He committed no sin, + nor was deception found in his mouth. + 23 When he was being insulted, * + he did not insult * in return. + When he was suffering, + he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the One who judges + righteously. 24 He himself bore our sins + in his own body on the stake, * + so that we might die to * sins and live to righteousness. And “by his wounds you were healed.” + 25 For you were like sheep going astray, + but now you have returned to the shepherd + and overseer of your souls. * Footnotes ^ Or “pure.” ^ Or “experienced.” ^ Lit., “put to shame.” ^ Lit., “the head of the corner.” ^ Lit., “the virtues,” that is, his praiseworthy qualities and deeds. ^ Or “the soul.” ^ Or “institution.” ^ Lit., “muzzle.” ^ Or “an excuse.” ^ Lit., “the brotherhood.” ^ Or “grief; pain.” ^ Or “revile.” ^ Or “reviled.” ^ Or “tree.” ^ Or “be finished with.” ^ Or “lives.” Previous Next Print Share Share
