Let the praise and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. + Amen.” 13 In response one of the elders said to me: “These who are dressed in the white robes, + who are they and where did they come from?” 14 So right away I said to him: “My lord, you are the one who knows.” And he said to me: “These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, + and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. + 15 That is why they are before the throne of God, and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne + will spread his tent over them. + 16 They will hunger no more nor thirst anymore, neither will the sun beat down on them nor any scorching heat, + 17 because the Lamb, + who is in the midst * of the throne, will shepherd them + and will guide them to springs * of waters of life. + And God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” + Footnotes ^ Or “east.” ^ Or “languages.” ^ Or “at the center.” ^ Or “fountains.” Previous Next Print Share Share
