Look! The Lion of the tribe of Judah, + the root + of David, + has conquered + so as to open the scroll and its seven seals.” 6 And I saw standing in the midst * of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders + a lamb + that seemed to have been slaughtered, + having seven horns and seven eyes, and the eyes mean the seven spirits of God + that have been sent out into the whole earth. 7 At once he came forward and took it out of the right hand of the One seated on the throne. + 8 When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders + fell down before the Lamb, and each one had a harp and golden bowls that were full of incense. (The incense means the prayers of the holy ones.) + 9 And they sing a new song, + saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought people for God + out of every tribe and tongue * and people and nation, + 10 and you made them to be a kingdom + and priests to our God, + and they are to rule as kings + over the earth.” 11 And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads * and thousands of thousands, + 12 and they were saying with a loud voice: “The Lamb who was slaughtered + is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.” + 13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth + and on the sea, and all the things in them, saying: “To the One sitting on the throne + and to the Lamb + be the blessing and the honor + and the glory and the might forever and ever.” + 14 The four living creatures were saying: “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshipped.
