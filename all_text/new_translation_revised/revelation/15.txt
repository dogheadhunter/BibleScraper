These are the last ones, because by means of them the anger of God is brought to a finish. + 2 And I saw something like a sea of glass + mingled with fire, and those who are victorious + over the wild beast and its image + and the number of its name + were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps of God. 3 They were singing the song of Moses + the slave of God and the song of the Lamb, + saying: “Great and wonderful are your works, + Jehovah * God, the Almighty. + Righteous and true are your ways, + King of eternity. + 4 Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, * and glorify your name, for you alone are loyal? + For all the nations will come and worship before you, + because your righteous decrees have been revealed.” 5 After this I saw, and the sanctuary of the tent of the witness + was opened in heaven, + 6 and the seven angels with the seven plagues + emerged from the sanctuary, clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes wrapped around their chests. 7 One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls that were full of the anger of God, + who lives forever and ever. 8 And the sanctuary became filled with smoke because of the glory of God + and because of his power, and no one was able to enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues + of the seven angels were finished.
