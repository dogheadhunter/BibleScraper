And there were thunders and voices and flashes of lightning + and an earthquake. 6 And the seven angels with the seven trumpets + prepared to blow them. 7 The first one blew his trumpet. And there was hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; + and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green vegetation was burned up. + 8 The second angel blew his trumpet. And something like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. + And a third of the sea became blood; + 9 and a third of the living creatures * in the sea died, + and a third of the ships were wrecked. 10 The third angel blew his trumpet. And a great star burning like a lamp fell from heaven, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs * of waters. + 11 The name of the star is Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many of the people died from the waters, because these had been made bitter. + 12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet. And a third of the sun was struck + and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, in order that a third of them might be darkened + and the day might not have light for a third of it, and the night likewise. 13 And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in midheaven say with a loud voice: “Woe, woe, woe + to those dwelling on the earth because of the rest of the trumpet blasts of the three angels who are about to blow their trumpets!” + Footnotes ^ Or “burner.” ^ Or “creatures that have souls.” ^ Or “fountains.” Previous Next Print Share Share
