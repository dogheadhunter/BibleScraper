In the midst of the throne * and around the throne were four living creatures + that were full of eyes in front and behind. 7 The first living creature was like a lion, + and the second living creature was like a young bull, + and the third living creature + had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature + was like a flying eagle. + 8 As for the four living creatures, each one of them had six wings; they were full of eyes all around and underneath. + And continuously, day and night, they say: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah * + God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.” + 9 Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to the One seated on the throne, the One who lives forever and ever, + 10 the 24 elders + fall down before the One seated on the throne and worship the One who lives forever and ever, and they cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 11 “You are worthy, Jehovah * our God, to receive the glory + and the honor + and the power, + because you created all things, + and because of your will they came into existence and were created.” Footnotes ^ Or “a precious red-colored stone.” ^ Or “In the middle with the throne.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 .
