They said: “Praise Jah! * + The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God, 2 because his judgments are true and righteous. + For he has executed judgment on the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, * and he has avenged the blood of his slaves that is on her hands.” * + 3 And right away for the second time they said: “Praise Jah! * + And the smoke from her goes on ascending forever and ever.” + 4 And the 24 elders + and the four living creatures + fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne and said: “Amen! Praise Jah!” * + 5 Also, a voice came from the throne and said: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, + who fear him, the small ones and the great.” + 6 And I heard what sounded like a voice of a great crowd and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of heavy thunders. They said: “Praise Jah, * + because Jehovah * our God, the Almighty, + has begun to rule as king! + 7 Let us rejoice and be overjoyed and give him glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself. 8 Yes, it has been granted to her to be clothed with bright, clean, fine linen—for the fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the holy ones.” + 9 And he tells me, “Write: Happy are those invited to the evening meal of the Lamb’s marriage.” + Also, he tells me: “These are the true sayings of God.” 10 At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! + I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing concerning Jesus. + Worship God! + For the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy.” + 11 I saw heaven opened, and look! a white horse. + And the one seated on it is called Faithful + and True, + and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. + 12 His eyes are a fiery flame, + and on his head are many diadems. * He has a name written that no one knows but he himself, 13 and he is clothed with an outer garment stained * with blood, and he is called by the name The Word + of God. 14 Also, the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen. 15 And out of his mouth protrudes a sharp, long sword + with which to strike the nations, and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron. + Moreover, he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. + 16 On his outer garment, yes, on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. + 17 I saw also an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice and said to all the birds that fly in midheaven: * “Come here, be gathered together to the great evening meal of God, + 18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of military commanders and the flesh of strong men + and the flesh of horses and of those seated on them, + and the flesh of all, of freemen as well as of slaves and of small ones and great.” 19 And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army. + 20 And the wild beast was caught, and along with it the false prophet + that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast + and those who worship its image. + While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur. + 21 But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse. + And all the birds were filled with their flesh. + Footnotes ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Greek, por·neiʹa.
