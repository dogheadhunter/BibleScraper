For we have left your commandments, 11 which you gave us through your servants the prophets, saying: ‘The land that you are going in to take possession of is an impure land because of the impurity of the peoples of the lands, because of their detestable practices with which they have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness. + 12 Therefore, do not give your daughters to their sons, neither accept their daughters for your sons; + and you must never seek their peace and their prosperity, + so that you may grow strong and eat the good of the land and take possession of it for your sons forever.’ 13 And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guilt—for you, O our God, have not dealt with us according to our error, + and you have allowed those of us here to escape + — 14 are we to break your commandments again and form marriage alliances * with the peoples who practice these detestable things? + Would you not become so angry with us that you would completely destroy us, leaving no remnant or survivor? 15 O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, + for we have survived as a remnant to this day. Here we are before you in our guilt, for it is impossible to stand before you because of this.” + Footnotes ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Lit., “who trembled at.” ^ Lit., “a peg.” ^ Or “a wall of protection.” ^ Or “and intermarry.” Previous Next Print Share Share
