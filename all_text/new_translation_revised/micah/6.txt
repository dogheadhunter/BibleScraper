( 6-8 ) Justice, loyalty, modesty ( 8 ) Israel’s guilt and punishment ( 9-16 ) 6 Hear, please, what Jehovah is saying. Get up, present a legal case before the mountains, And may the hills hear your voice. + 2 Hear, O mountains, the legal case of Jehovah, You firm foundations of the earth, + For Jehovah has a legal case with his people; It is against Israel that he will argue: + 3 “My people, what have I done to you? How have I tired you out? + Testify against me. 4 For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, + From the house of slavery I redeemed you; + I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Mirʹi·am. + 5 My people, remember, please, what King Baʹlak of Moʹab proposed, + And what Baʹlaam the son of Beʹor answered him + —What took place from Shitʹtim + to Gilʹgal + — So that you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.” 6 With what will I come before Jehovah? With what will I bow before God on high? Will I come before him with whole burnt offerings, With year-old calves? + 7 Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, With tens of thousands of torrents of oil? + Will I give my firstborn son for my revolt, The fruit of my body for my sin? * + 8 He has told you, O man, what is good. And what is Jehovah requiring * of you? Only to exercise justice, * + to cherish loyalty, * + And to walk in modesty + with your God! + 9 The voice of Jehovah calls out to the city; Those with practical wisdom will fear your name. Pay attention to the rod and to the one who appointed it. + 10 Are there still the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked And the incomplete eʹphah measure * that is detestable? 11 Can I be morally clean * with wicked scales, With a bag of fraudulent stone weights? + 12 For her rich men are full of violence, And her inhabitants speak lies; + Their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. + 13 “Therefore, I will wound you by striking you, + Making you desolate because of your sins. 14 You will eat but not be satisfied; You will be empty inside. + What you remove, you will not carry off safely, And what you do carry off, I will give to the sword. 15 You will sow seed, but you will not reap. You will tread olives, but you will not use the oil; And you will make new wine, but you will drink no wine. + 16 For you observe the statutes of Omʹri and all the work of the house of Aʹhab, + And you walk in accord with their advice. That is why I will make you an object of horror And her inhabitants something to be whistled at; + And you will bear the scorn of the peoples.” + Footnotes ^ Or “for the sin of my soul?” ^ Or “to be kind and loyal in your love.” Lit., “to love loyal love.” ^ Or “to be just; to be fair.” ^ Or “asking back.” ^ See App. B14 . ^ Or “be innocent.” Previous Next Print Share Share
