What you have stored up will be like a fire in the last days. + 4 Look! The wages you have withheld from the workers who harvested your fields keep crying out, and the cries for help of the reapers have reached the ears of Jehovah * of armies. + 5 You have lived in luxury and for self-gratification on the earth. You have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter. + 6 You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one. Is he not opposing you? 7 Be patient then, brothers, until the presence of the Lord. + Look! The farmer keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, exercising patience over it until the early rain and the late rain arrive. + 8 You too exercise patience; + make your hearts firm, because the presence of the Lord has drawn close. + 9 Do not grumble * against one another, brothers, so that you do not get judged. + Look! The Judge is standing before the doors. 10 Brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering of evil + and the exercising of patience + the prophets who spoke in the name of Jehovah. * + 11 Look! We consider happy * those who have endured. + You have heard of the endurance of Job + and have seen the outcome Jehovah * gave, + that Jehovah * is very tender in affection * and merciful. + 12 Above all, my brothers, stop swearing, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath. But let your “Yes” mean yes and your “No,” no, + so that you do not become liable to judgment. 13 Is there anyone suffering hardship among you? Let him carry on prayer. + Is there anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms. + 14 Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the elders + of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, applying oil to him + in the name of Jehovah. * 15 And the prayer of faith will make the sick one * well, and Jehovah * will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. 16 Therefore, openly confess your sins + to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. A righteous man’s supplication has a powerful effect. * + 17 E·liʹjah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet when he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. + 18 Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land produced fruit. + 19 My brothers, if anyone among you is led astray from the truth and another turns him back, 20 know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error + of his way will save him * from death and will cover a multitude of sins. + Footnotes ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “groan; complain.” Lit., “heave sighs.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “very compassionate.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “blessed.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or possibly, “tired one.” ^ See App. A5 . ^ Lit., “has much force when it is at work.” ^ Or “his soul.” Previous Next Print Share Share
