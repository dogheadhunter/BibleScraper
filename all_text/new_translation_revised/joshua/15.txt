This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah by their families on all sides. 13 And to Caʹleb + the son of Je·phunʹneh, he gave a share among the descendants of Judah at the order of Jehovah to Joshua, namely, Kirʹi·ath-arʹba (Arʹba was the father of Aʹnak), that is, Hebʹron. + 14 So Caʹleb drove out from there the three sons of Aʹnak: + Sheʹshai, A·hiʹman, and Talʹmai, + descendants of Aʹnak. 15 Then he went up from there against the inhabitants of Deʹbir. + (The name of Deʹbir was previously Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher.) 16 Caʹleb then said: “To the man who strikes Kirʹi·ath-seʹpher and captures it, I will give my daughter Achʹsah as a wife.” 17 And Othʹni·el + the son of Keʹnaz, + Caʹleb’s brother, captured it. So he gave him his daughter Achʹsah + as a wife. 18 While she was going home, she urged him to ask her father for a field. Then she dismounted from her donkey. * Caʹleb asked her: “What do you want?” + 19 She said: “Please grant me a blessing, for you have given me a piece of land in the south; * give me also Gulʹloth-maʹim.” * So he gave her Upper Gulʹloth and Lower Gulʹloth. 20 This was the inheritance of the tribe of Judah by their families. 21 The cities at the extremity of the tribe of Judah toward the boundary of Eʹdom + in the south were: Kabʹze·el, Eʹder, Jaʹgur, 22 Kiʹnah, Di·moʹnah, A·daʹdah, 23 Keʹdesh, Haʹzor, Ithʹnan, 24 Ziph, Teʹlem, Be·aʹloth, 25 Haʹzor-ha·datʹtah, and Keʹri·oth-hezʹron, that is, Haʹzor, 26 Aʹmam, Sheʹma, Mo·laʹdah, + 27 Haʹzar-gadʹdah, Heshʹmon, Beth-pelʹet, + 28 Haʹzar-shuʹal, Beʹer-sheʹba, + Biz·i·o·thiʹah, 29 Baʹal·ah, Iʹim, Eʹzem, 30 El·toʹlad, Cheʹsil, Horʹmah, + 31 Zikʹlag, + Mad·manʹnah, San·sanʹnah, 32 Le·baʹoth, Shilʹhim, Aʹin, and Rimʹmon + —a total of 29 cities together with their settlements. 33 In the She·pheʹlah, + there were: Eshʹta·ol, Zorʹah, + Ashʹnah, 34 Za·noʹah, En-ganʹnim, Tapʹpu·ah, Eʹnam, 35 Jarʹmuth, A·dulʹlam, + Soʹcoh, A·zeʹkah, + 36 Shaʹa·raʹim, + Ad·i·thaʹim, and Ge·deʹrah and Ged·e·ro·thaʹim * —14 cities and their settlements. 37 Zeʹnan, Ha·dashʹah, Migʹdal-gad, 38 Diʹle·an, Mizʹpeh, Jokʹthe·el, 39 Laʹchish, + Bozʹkath, Egʹlon, 40 Cabʹbon, Lahʹmam, Chitʹlish, 41 Ge·deʹroth, Beth-daʹgon, Naʹa·mah, and Mak·keʹdah + —16 cities and their settlements. 42 Libʹnah, + Eʹther, Aʹshan, + 43 Iphʹtah, Ashʹnah, Neʹzib, 44 Keiʹlah, Achʹzib, and Ma·reʹshah—nine cities and their settlements. 45 Ekʹron and its dependent * towns and its settlements; 46 from Ekʹron westward, all that is alongside Ashʹdod and their settlements. 47 Ashʹdod, + its dependent * towns and its settlements; Gazʹa, + its dependent towns and its settlements, down to the Wadi of Egypt, the Great Sea, * and the adjacent region. + 48 And in the mountainous region, Shaʹmir, Jatʹtir, + Soʹcoh, 49 Danʹnah, Kirʹi·ath-sanʹnah, that is, Deʹbir, 50 Aʹnab, Eshʹte·moh, + Aʹnim, 51 Goʹshen, + Hoʹlon, and Giʹloh + —11 cities and their settlements. 52 Arab, Duʹmah, Eʹshan, 53 Jaʹnim, Beth-tapʹpu·ah, A·pheʹkah, 54 Humʹtah, Kirʹi·ath-arʹba, that is, Hebʹron, + and Ziʹor—nine cities and their settlements. 55 Maʹon, + Carʹmel, Ziph, + Jutʹtah, 56 Jezʹre·el, Jokʹde·am, Za·noʹah, 57 Kaʹin, Gibʹe·ah, and Timʹnah + —ten cities and their settlements. 58 Halʹhul, Beth-zur, Geʹdor, 59 Maʹa·rath, Beth-aʹnoth, and Elʹte·kon—six cities and their settlements. 60 Kirʹi·ath-baʹal, that is, Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, + and Rabʹbah—two cities and their settlements. 61 In the wilderness, Beth-arʹa·bah, + Midʹdin, Se·caʹcah, 62 Nibʹshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedʹi + —six cities and their settlements. 63 As for the Jebʹu·sites + who were dwelling in Jerusalem, + the men of Judah were not able to drive them away, + so the Jebʹu·sites continue dwelling with the people of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
