(He was one of the last of the Rephʹa·im.) + Moses defeated them and drove them out. * + 13 But the Israelites did not drive out * + the Geshʹur·ites and the Ma·acʹa·thites, for Geshʹur and Maʹa·cath live in the midst of Israel to this day. 14 It was only to the tribe of the Levites that he did not give an inheritance. + The offerings made by fire to Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance, + just as he promised them. + 15 Then Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the Reuʹben·ites by their families, 16 and their territory was from A·roʹer, which is on the rim of the Arʹnon Valley, * and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the tableland by Medʹe·ba; 17 Heshʹbon and all its towns + on the tableland, Diʹbon, Baʹmoth-baʹal, Beth-baʹal-meʹon, + 18 Jaʹhaz, + Kedʹe·moth, + Mephʹa·ath, + 19 Kir·i·a·thaʹim, Sibʹmah, + and Zeʹreth-shaʹhar on the mountain of the valley, * 20 Beth-peʹor, the slopes of Pisʹgah, + Beth-jeshʹi·moth, + 21 all the cities of the tableland, and all the royal realm of King Siʹhon of the Amʹor·ites, who reigned in Heshʹbon. + Moses defeated him + and the Midʹi·an·ite chieftains Eʹvi, Reʹkem, Zur, Hur, and Reʹba, + vassals * of Siʹhon who were dwelling in the land. 22 Baʹlaam + the son of Beʹor, the diviner, + was one whom the Israelites killed with the sword along with the rest who were slain. 23 The boundary of the Reuʹben·ites was the Jordan; and this territory was the inheritance of the Reuʹben·ites by their families, with the cities and their settlements. 24 Furthermore, Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, the Gadʹites by their families, 25 and their territory included Jaʹzer + and all the cities of Gilʹe·ad and half of the land of the Amʹmon·ites + as far as A·roʹer, which faces Rabʹbah; + 26 and from Heshʹbon + to Raʹmath-mizʹpeh and Betʹo·nim, and from Ma·ha·naʹim + to the border of Deʹbir; 27 and in the valley, * Beth-haʹram, Beth-nimʹrah, + Sucʹcoth, + and Zaʹphon, the rest of the royal realm of King Siʹhon of Heshʹbon, + with the Jordan as the border from the lower end of the Sea of Chinʹne·reth * + on the east side of the Jordan. 28 This was the inheritance of the Gadʹites by their families, with the cities and their settlements. 29 Further, Moses gave an inheritance to the half tribe of Ma·nasʹseh, to half of the tribe of Ma·nasʹseh by their families. + 30 And their territory extended from Ma·ha·naʹim + and took in all of Baʹshan, all the royal realm of King Og of Baʹshan, and all the tent villages of Jaʹir + in Baʹshan, 60 towns. 31 And half of Gilʹe·ad, and Ashʹta·roth and Edʹre·i, + the cities of the royal realm of Og in Baʹshan, went to the sons of Maʹchir + the son of Ma·nasʹseh, to half of the sons of Maʹchir by their families. 32 These were the inheritances that Moses gave them on the desert plains of Moʹab beyond the Jordan, east of Jerʹi·cho. + 33 But to the tribe of the Levites, Moses did not give an inheritance. + Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance, just as he promised them. + Footnotes ^ Or “be conquered.” ^ Lit., “in front of.” ^ Or “from Shihor.” ^ Or “the entrance of Hamath.” ^ Or “dispossess them.” ^ Or “plateau.” ^ Or “Wadi Arnon.” ^ Or “dispossessed them.” ^ Or “dispossess.” ^ Or “Wadi Arnon.” ^ Or “low plain.” ^ That is, kings who were subject to Sihon. ^ Or “low plain.” ^ That is, the lake of Gennesaret, or the Sea of Galilee.
