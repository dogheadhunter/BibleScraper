My strength is now as it was then, for war and for other activities. 12 Therefore, give me this mountainous region that Jehovah promised on that day. Though you heard on that day that there were Anʹa·kim + there with great fortified cities, + surely * Jehovah will be with me, + and I will drive them out, * just as Jehovah promised.” + 13 So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebʹron to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh as an inheritance. + 14 That is why Hebʹron belongs to Caʹleb the son of Je·phunʹneh the Kenʹiz·zite as an inheritance to this day, because he followed Jehovah the God of Israel wholeheartedly. + 15 The name of Hebʹron was previously Kirʹi·ath-arʹba + (Arʹba was the great man among the Anʹa·kim). And the land had rest from war. + Footnotes ^ That is, the east side. ^ Lit., “with a word just as with my heart.” ^ Lit., “caused the heart of the people to melt.” ^ Lit., “fully; completely.” ^ Or “dispossess them.” ^ Or “likely.” Previous Next Print Share Share
