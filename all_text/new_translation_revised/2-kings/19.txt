So offer up a prayer + in behalf of the remnant who have survived.’” 5 So the servants of King Hez·e·kiʹah went in to Isaiah, + 6 and Isaiah said to them: “This is what you should say to your lord, ‘This is what Jehovah says: “Do not be afraid + because of the words that you heard, the words with which the attendants of the king of As·syrʹi·a blasphemed me. + 7 Here I am putting a thought in his mind, * and he will hear a report and return to his own land; and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.”’” + 8 After the Rabʹsha·keh heard that the king of As·syrʹi·a had pulled away from Laʹchish, + he returned to him and found him fighting against Libʹnah. + 9 Now the king heard it said about King Tir·haʹkah of E·thi·oʹpi·a: “Here he has come out to fight against you.” So he sent messengers + again to Hez·e·kiʹah, saying: 10 “This is what you should say to King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying: “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As·syrʹi·a.” + 11 Look! You have heard what the kings of As·syrʹi·a did to all the lands by devoting them to destruction. + Will you alone be rescued? 12 Did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed rescue them? Where are Goʹzan, Haʹran, + Reʹzeph, and the people of Eʹden who were in Tel-asʹsar? 13 Where is the king of Haʹmath, the king of Arʹpad, and the king of the cities of Seph·ar·vaʹim, and of Heʹna, and of Ivʹvah?’” + 14 Hez·e·kiʹah took the letters out of the hand of the messengers and read them. Hez·e·kiʹah then went up to the house of Jehovah and spread them * out before Jehovah. + 15 And Hez·e·kiʹah began to pray + before Jehovah and say: “O Jehovah the God of Israel, sitting enthroned above * the cherubs, + you alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of the earth. + You made the heavens and the earth. 16 Incline your ear, O Jehovah, and hear! + Open your eyes, + O Jehovah, and see! Hear the words that Sen·nachʹer·ib has sent to taunt the living God. 17 It is a fact, O Jehovah, that the kings of As·syrʹi·a have devastated the nations and their lands. + 18 And they have thrown their gods into the fire, because they were not gods + but the work of human hands, + wood and stone. That is why they could destroy them. 19 But now, O Jehovah our God, please save us out of his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are God, O Jehovah.” + 20 Isaiah son of Aʹmoz then sent this message to Hez·e·kiʹah: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says, ‘I have heard your prayer + to me concerning King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a. + 21 This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him: “The virgin daughter of Zion despises you, she scoffs at you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you. 22 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? + Against whom have you raised your voice + And lifted your arrogant eyes? It is against the Holy One of Israel! + 23 Through your messengers + you have taunted Jehovah + and said, ‘With the multitude of my war chariots I will ascend the heights of mountains, The remotest parts of Lebʹa·non. I will cut down its lofty cedars, its choice juniper trees. I will enter its farthest retreats, its densest forests. 24 I will dig wells and drink foreign waters; I will dry up all the streams * of Egypt with the soles of my feet.’ 25 Have you not heard? From long ago it was determined. * + From days gone by I have prepared * it. + Now I will bring it about. + You will turn fortified cities into desolate piles of ruins. + 26 Their inhabitants will be helpless; They will be terrified and put to shame. They will become as vegetation of the field and green grass, + As grass of the roofs that is scorched by the east wind. 27 But I well know when you sit, when you go out, when you come in, + And when you are enraged against me, + 28 Because your rage against me + and your roaring have reached my ears. + So I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle + between your lips, And I will lead you back the way you came.” + 29 “‘And this will be the sign for you: * This year you will eat what grows on its own; * and in the second year you will eat grain that sprouts from that; + but in the third year you will sow seed and reap, and you will plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. + 30 Those of the house of Judah who escape, those who are left, + will take root downward and produce fruit upward. 31 For a remnant will go out of Jerusalem and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this. + 32 “‘Therefore this is what Jehovah says about the king of As·syrʹi·a: + “He will not come into this city + Or shoot an arrow there Or confront it with a shield Or cast up a siege rampart against it. + 33 By the way he came he will return; He will not come into this city,” declares Jehovah. 34 “I will defend this city + and save it for my own sake + And for the sake of my servant David.”’” + 35 On that very night the angel of Jehovah went out and struck down 185,000 men in the camp of the As·syrʹi·ans. + When people rose up early in the morning, they saw all the dead bodies. + 36 So King Sen·nachʹer·ib of As·syrʹi·a departed and returned to Ninʹe·veh + and stayed there. + 37 And as he was bowing down at the house * of his god Nisʹroch, his own sons A·dramʹme·lech and Shar·eʹzer struck him down with the sword + and then escaped to the land of Arʹa·rat. + And his son Eʹsar-hadʹdon + became king in his place.
