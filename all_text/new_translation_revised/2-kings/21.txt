18 Then Ma·nasʹseh was laid to rest with his forefathers and was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzʹza; + and his son Aʹmon became king in his place. 19 Aʹmon + was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. + His mother’s name was Me·shulʹle·meth the daughter of Haʹruz from Jotʹbah. 20 He continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Ma·nasʹseh had done. + 21 He kept walking in all the ways that his father walked, and he continued serving and bowing down to the disgusting idols that his father had served. + 22 So he abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers, and he did not walk in the way of Jehovah. + 23 Eventually Aʹmon’s servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house. 24 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Aʹmon, and they made his son Jo·siʹah king in his place. + 25 As for the rest of the history of Aʹmon, what he did, is it not written in the book of the history of the times of the kings of Judah? 26 So they buried him in his grave in the garden of Uzʹza, + and his son Jo·siʹah + became king in his place.
