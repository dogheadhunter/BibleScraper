These were the sons of Leʹvi by their paternal houses. 31 And they also cast lots + just as their brothers the sons of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zaʹdok, A·himʹe·lech, and the heads of the paternal houses of the priests and of the Levites. Regarding the paternal houses, the head one was just as his younger brother. Footnotes Previous Next Print Share Share
