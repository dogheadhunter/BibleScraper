These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. 23 David did not count those 20 years of age and under, because Jehovah had promised to make Israel as many as the stars of the heavens. + 24 Joʹab the son of Ze·ruʹiah had started to take the count, but he did not finish; and God’s anger came against Israel * because of this, + and the number was not entered into the account of the history of the times of King David. 25 Over the treasuries of the king + was Azʹma·veth the son of Adʹi·el. Jonʹa·than the son of Uz·ziʹah was over the storehouses * in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers. 26 Over the field workers who cultivated the soil was Ezʹri the son of Cheʹlub. 27 Shimʹe·i the Raʹmath·ite was over the vineyards; over the produce of the vineyards for the wine supplies was Zabʹdi the Shiphʹmite. 28 Over the olive groves and the sycamore trees + in the She·pheʹlah + was Baʹal-haʹnan the Ge·deʹrite; over the oil supplies was Joʹash. 29 Over the herds that grazed in Sharʹon + was Shitʹrai the Sharʹon·ite, and Shaʹphat the son of Adʹlai was over the herds in the valley plains. * 30 Over the camels was Oʹbil the Ishʹma·el·ite; over the donkeys * was Jeh·deʹiah the Me·ronʹo·thite. 31 Over the flocks was Jaʹziz the Hagʹrite. All of these were the chiefs of King David’s property. 32 Jonʹa·than, + David’s nephew, was an adviser, a man of understanding and a secretary, and Je·hiʹel the son of Hachʹmo·ni looked after the king’s sons. + 33 A·hithʹo·phel + was an adviser to the king, and Huʹshai + the Arʹchite was the king’s friend. * 34 After A·hithʹo·phel there were Je·hoiʹa·da the son of Be·naiʹah + and A·biʹa·thar; + and Joʹab + was chief of the king’s army.
