And what is my house that you have brought me this far? + 17 As if this were not enough, O God, you also speak about the house of your servant down to a distant future time, + and you have looked on me as if I were a man who should be further exalted, * O Jehovah God. 18 What more can your servant David say to you about the honor given me when you know your servant so well? + 19 O Jehovah, for the sake of your servant and in agreement with your heart * you have done all these great things by revealing your greatness. + 20 O Jehovah, there is no one like you, + and there is no God except you; + everything we have heard with our ears confirms this. 21 And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel? + The true God went and redeemed them as his people. + You made a name for yourself by your great and awe-inspiring deeds, + driving out nations from before your people, + whom you redeemed from Egypt. 22 You made your people Israel your own people for all time; + and you, O Jehovah, became their God. + 23 Now, O Jehovah, may the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house prove faithful for all time, and may you do just as you have promised. + 24 May your name endure * and be exalted + forever, so that people may say, ‘Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, is God to Israel,’ and may the house of your servant David be firmly established before you. + 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant your purpose to build him a house. * That is why your servant has the confidence to offer this prayer to you. 26 And now, O Jehovah, you are the true God, and you have promised these good things concerning your servant. 27 So may it please you to bless the house of your servant, and may it continue forever before you, for you, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.” Footnotes ^ Or “palace.” ^ Possibly meaning “from one tent site to another and from one dwelling place to another.” ^ Lit., “cut off.” ^ Lit., “wear them out.” ^ Or “dynasty.” ^ Lit., “seed.” ^ Or “a man of high station.” ^ Or “in harmony with your will.” ^ Or “prove faithful.” ^ Or “dynasty.” Previous Next Print Share Share
