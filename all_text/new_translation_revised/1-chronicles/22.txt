You will not build a house for my name, + for you have shed a great deal of blood on the earth before me. 9 Look! You will have a son + who will be a man of peace, * and I will give him rest from all his enemies who surround him, + for Solʹo·mon * + will be his name and I will grant Israel peace and quiet in his days. + 10 He is the one who will build a house for my name. + He will become my son, and I will be his father. + I will firmly establish the throne of his kingship over Israel forever.’ + 11 “Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you, and may you be successful and build the house of Jehovah your God, just as he has spoken concerning you. + 12 Only may Jehovah give you discretion and understanding + when he gives you authority over Israel, so that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God. + 13 Then you will be successful if you carefully observe the regulations + and the judgments that Jehovah ordered Moses to give Israel. + Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or be terrified. + 14 Here I have taken great pains to prepare for Jehovah’s house 100,000 talents * of gold and 1,000,000 talents of silver and such great quantities of copper and iron + that they cannot be weighed, and I have prepared timbers and stones, + but you will add to them. 15 A great number of workmen are with you—stonecutters, stonemasons, + woodworkers, and all kinds of skilled workers. + 16 The gold, silver, copper, and iron are beyond measure. + Get up and begin the work, and may Jehovah be with you.” + 17 David then ordered all the princes of Israel to help his son Solʹo·mon: 18 “Is not Jehovah your God with you, and has he not given you rest on every side? For he handed over to me the inhabitants of the land, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before his people. 19 Now determine with all your heart and soul * to seek Jehovah your God, + and start building the sanctuary of Jehovah the true God, + in order to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy utensils of the true God + to the house built for the name of Jehovah.” + Footnotes ^ Or “delicate.” ^ Lit., “rest.” ^ From a Hebrew word meaning “Peace.” ^ A talent equaled 34.2 kg (1,101 oz t).
