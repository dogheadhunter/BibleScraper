This is what you should do, so that you may not incur guilt. 11 Here is Am·a·riʹah the chief priest who is over you for every matter of Jehovah. + Zeb·a·diʹah the son of Ishʹma·el is the leader of the house of Judah for every matter pertaining to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers for you. Be strong and act, and let Jehovah be with those who do what is good.” * + Footnotes ^ Or “in peace.” ^ Or “palace.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “your heart is resolved.” ^ Or “completely devoted.” ^ Or “with what is good.” Previous Next Print Share Share
