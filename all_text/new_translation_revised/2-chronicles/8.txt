So the house of Jehovah was completed. + 17 It was then that Solʹo·mon went to Eʹzi·on-geʹber + and to Eʹloth + on the seashore in the land of Eʹdom. + 18 Hiʹram + sent him ships and experienced seamen by means of his own servants. They went with Solʹo·mon’s servants to Oʹphir + and took from there 450 talents * of gold + and brought it to King Solʹo·mon. + Footnotes ^ Or “palace.” ^ Lit., “sons of Israel.” ^ Or “rebuilt.” ^ Or “Temporary Shelters.” ^ Or “well-arranged; completed.” ^ A talent equaled 34.2 kg (1,101 oz t).
