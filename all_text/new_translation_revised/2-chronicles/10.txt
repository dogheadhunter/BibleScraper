My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.’” 12 Jer·o·boʹam and all the people came to Re·ho·boʹam on the third day, just as the king had said: “Return to me on the third day.” + 13 But the king answered them harshly. Thus King Re·ho·boʹam rejected the advice of the older men. * 14 He spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying: “I will make your yoke heavier, and I will add to it. My father punished you with whips, but I will do so with scourges.” 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was caused by the true God, + in order to carry out the word that Jehovah had spoken through A·hiʹjah + the Shiʹlo·nite to Jer·o·boʹam the son of Neʹbat. 16 As for all Israel, because the king refused to listen to them, the people replied to the king: “What share do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesʹse. Each one to your gods, O Israel! Now look after your own house, O David.” + With that all Israel returned to their homes. * + 17 But Re·ho·boʹam continued to reign over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah. + 18 Then King Re·ho·boʹam sent Ha·doʹram, + who was in charge of those conscripted for forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Re·ho·boʹam managed to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. + 19 And the Israelites have been in revolt against the house of David down to this day.
