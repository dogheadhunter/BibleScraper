Libʹnah + also revolted against him at that time, because he had abandoned Jehovah the God of his forefathers. + 11 He had also made high places + on the mountains of Judah to cause the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution, and he led Judah astray. 12 Eventually a written message came to him from E·liʹjah + the prophet, saying: “This is what Jehovah the God of David your forefather says, ‘You have not walked in the ways of your father Je·hoshʹa·phat + or in the ways of King Aʹsa + of Judah. 13 But you walk in the way of the kings of Israel + and cause Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit spiritual prostitution + like the prostitution of the house of Aʹhab, + and you even killed your own brothers, + the household of your father, who were better than you. 14 Therefore, Jehovah is dealing a great blow to your people, to your sons, to your wives, and to all your possessions. 15 And you will suffer with many sicknesses, including a disease of your intestines, until your intestines come out because of the disease, day after day.’” 16 Then Jehovah stirred up + against Je·hoʹram the Phi·lisʹtines * + and the Arabs + who were near the E·thi·oʹpi·ans. 17 So they invaded Judah, forcing their way in, and carried off all the possessions that were found in the king’s house, * + as well as his sons and his wives; and the only son left to him was Je·hoʹa·haz, * + his youngest son. 18 And after all of this, Jehovah afflicted him with an incurable disease in his intestines. + 19 Some time later, when two full years had passed, his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died while suffering severely from his disease; and his people did not make a burning for him like the burning that was made for his forefathers. + 20 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. No one regretted it when he died. So they buried him in the City of David, + but not in the burial places of the kings. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the spirit of the Philistines.” ^ Or “palace.” ^ Also called Ahaziah.
