He covered it with 600 talents * of fine gold. + 9 The weight of the gold for the nails was 50 shekels; * and he covered the roof chambers with gold. 10 Then he made in the Most Holy compartment * two cherub sculptures, and he overlaid them with gold. + 11 The overall length of the wings of the cherubs + was 20 cubits; one wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the other cherub’s wings. 12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits long and touched the other wall of the house, and its other wing was five cubits long and touched one of the first cherub’s wings. 13 The wings of these cherubs were spread out 20 cubits; and they stood on their feet, and they faced inward. * 14 He also made the curtain + of blue thread, purple wool, crimson, and fine fabric, and incorporated cherub designs into it. + 15 Then he made two pillars + at the front of the house, 35 cubits in length, and the capital on top of each pillar was five cubits. + 16 And he made chains, like necklaces, and put them on the tops of the pillars, and he made 100 pomegranates and put them on the chains. 17 He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one to the right * and one to the left; * he named the one on the right Jaʹchin * and the one on the left Boʹaz. * Footnotes ^ A standard cubit equaled 44.5 cm (17.5 in.), but some feel that “the former measurement” refers to the long cubit that equaled 51.8 cm (20.4 in.). See App. B14 . ^ Some ancient manuscripts read “120,” whereas other manuscripts and some translations read “20 cubits.” ^ Or “20 cubits extending across the width of the house.” ^ A talent equaled 34.2 kg (1,101 oz t). See App. B14 . ^ Lit., “house.” ^ A shekel equaled 11.4 g (0.367 oz t). See App. B14 . ^ Lit., “house.” ^ That is, toward the Holy. ^ Or “south.” ^ Or “north.” ^ Meaning “May He [that is, Jehovah] Firmly Establish.” ^ Possibly meaning “In Strength.” Previous Next Print Share Share
