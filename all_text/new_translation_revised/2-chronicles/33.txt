Further, he appointed army chiefs in all the fortified cities in Judah. 15 He then removed the foreign gods and the idol image from the house of Jehovah + and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of the house of Jehovah + and in Jerusalem, and he had them thrown outside the city. 16 He also prepared the altar of Jehovah + and began to offer up communion sacrifices + and thanksgiving sacrifices + on it, and he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel. 17 Nevertheless, the people were still sacrificing on the high places, although only to Jehovah their God. 18 As for the rest of the history of Ma·nasʹseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the visionaries who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, they are recorded in the history of the kings of Israel. 19 Also his prayer + and how his entreaty was granted him, all his sins and his unfaithfulness, + the locations where he built high places and set up the sacred poles * + and the graven images before he humbled himself, they are written among the words of his visionaries. 20 Then Ma·nasʹseh was laid to rest with his forefathers, and they buried him at his house; and his son Aʹmon became king in his place. + 21 Aʹmon + was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. + 22 And he continued to do what was bad in Jehovah’s eyes, just as his father Ma·nasʹseh had done; + and Aʹmon sacrificed to all the graven images that his father Ma·nasʹseh had made, + and he kept serving them. 23 But he did not humble himself before Jehovah + as Ma·nasʹseh his father had humbled himself; + instead, Aʹmon greatly increased his guilt. 24 Eventually his servants conspired against him + and put him to death in his own house. 25 But the people of the land struck down all those who conspired against King Aʹmon, + and they made his son Jo·siʹah + king in his place.
