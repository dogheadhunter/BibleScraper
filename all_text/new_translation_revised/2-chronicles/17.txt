The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats from their flocks. 12 Je·hoshʹa·phat grew greater and greater, + and he continued building fortified places + and storage cities + in Judah. 13 He carried out extensive projects in the cities of Judah, and he had soldiers, mighty warriors, in Jerusalem. 14 These were grouped by their paternal houses: of Judah the chiefs of thousands, Adʹnah the chief, and with him were 300,000 mighty warriors. + 15 And under his command was Je·ho·haʹnan the chief, and with him were 280,000. 16 And also under his command was Am·a·siʹah the son of Zichʹri, who volunteered for Jehovah’s service, and with him were 200,000 mighty warriors. 17 And out of Benjamin + was E·liʹa·da, a mighty warrior, and with him were 200,000 men equipped with the bow and shield. + 18 And under his command was Je·hozʹa·bad, and with him were 180,000 men equipped for the army. 19 These were ministering to the king in addition to those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “walked in.” ^ See Glossary .
