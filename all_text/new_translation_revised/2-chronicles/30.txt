The priests and the Levites felt ashamed, so they sanctified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah. 16 They took their customary places, according to the Law of Moses the man of the true God; then the priests sprinkled the blood + received from the hand of the Levites. 17 There were many in the congregation who had not sanctified themselves, and the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover sacrifices for all who were not clean, + to sanctify them to Jehovah. 18 For a great number of the people, especially those from Eʹphra·im, Ma·nasʹseh, + Isʹsa·char, and Zebʹu·lun, had not cleansed themselves, but they still ate the Passover, contrary to what is written. But Hez·e·kiʹah prayed for them, saying: “May Jehovah, who is good, + make allowance for 19 everyone who has prepared his heart to search for the true God, + Jehovah, the God of his forefathers, although he has not been purified according to the standard of holiness.” + 20 And Jehovah listened to Hez·e·kiʹah and pardoned * the people. 21 So the Israelites who were in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread + for seven days with great rejoicing, + and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, loudly playing their instruments to Jehovah. + 22 Moreover, Hez·e·kiʹah spoke to and encouraged * all the Levites who served Jehovah with discretion. And they ate throughout the festival for seven days, + sacrificing communion sacrifices + and giving thanks to Jehovah the God of their forefathers. 23 Then all the congregation decided to observe it for seven more days, so they observed it for seven more days with rejoicing. + 24 And King Hez·e·kiʹah of Judah contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep, and the princes contributed for the congregation 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep; + and priests were sanctifying themselves in great number. + 25 And all the congregation of Judah, the priests, the Levites, all the congregation that came from Israel, + and the foreign residents + who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah continued rejoicing. 26 And there was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solʹo·mon the son of David the king of Israel, nothing like this had happened in Jerusalem. + 27 Finally the Levite priests stood up and blessed the people; + and God heard their voice, and their prayer reached his holy dwelling, the heavens.
