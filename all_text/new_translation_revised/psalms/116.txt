I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have freed me from my bonds. + 17 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving; + I will call on the name of Jehovah. 18 I will pay my vows to Jehovah + In the presence of all his people, + 19 In the courtyards of the house of Jehovah, + In your midst, O Jerusalem.
