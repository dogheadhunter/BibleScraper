Seek his face * constantly. 5 Remember the wonderful works he has performed, His miracles and the judgments he has pronounced, + 6 You offspring * of Abraham his servant, + You sons of Jacob, his chosen ones. + 7 He is Jehovah our God. + His judgments are throughout the earth. + 8 He remembers his covenant forever, + The promise he made, * to a thousand generations, + 9 The covenant he made with Abraham, + And the oath he swore to Isaac, + 10 Which he established as a decree to Jacob And as a lasting covenant to Israel, 11 Saying, “I will give you the land of Caʹnaan + As your allotted inheritance.” + 12 This was when they were few in number, + Yes, very few, and they were foreigners in the land. + 13 They walked about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people. + 14 He did not allow any man to oppress them, + But on their account he reproved kings, + 15 Saying, “Do not touch my anointed ones, And to my prophets do nothing bad.” + 16 He called down a famine on the land; + He cut off their supply of bread. * 17 He sent ahead of them a man Who was sold to be a slave, Joseph. + 18 With fetters they bound * his feet, + His neck was put in irons; * 19 Until the time that his word proved true, + The saying of Jehovah is what refined him. 20 The king sent to release him, + The ruler of the peoples set him free. 21 He made him master of his household, Ruler over all his property, + 22 To have authority over * his princes as he pleased * And to teach his elders wisdom. + 23 Then Israel came into Egypt, + And Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham. 24 God made his people very fruitful; + He made them mightier than their adversaries, + 25 Whose hearts he let change to hate his people, To plot against his servants. + 26 He sent his servant Moses, + And Aaron, + whom he had chosen. 27 They performed his signs among them, His miracles in the land of Ham. + 28 He sent darkness and the land became dark; + They did not rebel against his words. 29 He changed their waters into blood And killed their fish. + 30 Their land swarmed with frogs, + Even in the royal chambers. 31 He ordered the gadflies to invade And gnats in all their territories. + 32 He turned their rain to hail And sent lightning * on their land. + 33 He struck their vines and their fig trees And shattered the trees of their territory. 34 He said that the locusts should invade, Young locusts without number. + 35 They devoured all the vegetation in the land, And they devoured the produce of the ground. 36 Then he struck down every firstborn in their land, + The beginning of their procreative power. 37 He brought his people out with silver and gold; + And no one among his tribes stumbled. 38 Egypt rejoiced when they left, For the dread of Israel * had fallen on them. + 39 He spread a cloud to screen them off + And fire to give light by night. + 40 They asked, and he brought quail; + He kept satisfying them with bread from heaven. + 41 He opened a rock, and waters flowed out; + These flowed through the desert like a river. + 42 For he remembered the holy promise he had made to Abraham his servant. + 43 So he brought out his people with exultation, + His chosen ones with a joyful cry. 44 He gave them the lands of nations; + They inherited what other peoples had worked hard to produce, + 45 So that they would keep his decrees + And observe his laws.
