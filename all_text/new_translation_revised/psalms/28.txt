If you keep silent toward me, I will become like those going down to the pit. * + 2 Hear my pleas when I cry to you for help As I lift up my hands toward the innermost room of your sanctuary. + 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with those practicing what is hurtful, + Those who are speaking words of peace with their fellow man while evil is in their hearts. + 4 Pay them back for their deeds, + According to their evil practices. Repay them for the work of their hands, According to what they have done. + 5 For they pay no attention to the activities of Jehovah, + Nor to the work of his hands. + He will tear them down and not build them up. 6 May Jehovah be praised, For he has heard my pleas for help. 7 Jehovah is my strength + and my shield; + In him my heart trusts. + I have received his help, and my heart rejoices, So I will praise him with my song. 8 Jehovah is a strength for his people; He is a stronghold, bringing grand salvation to his anointed one. + 9 Save your people, and bless your inheritance. + Shepherd them and carry them in your arms forever. + Footnotes ^ Or “grave.” Previous Next Print Share Share
