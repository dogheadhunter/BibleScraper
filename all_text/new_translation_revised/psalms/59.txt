Mikʹtam. * When Saul sent men to watch David’s * house to put him to death. + 59 Rescue me from my enemies, O my God; + Protect me from those rising up against me. + 2 Rescue me from those who act wickedly, And save me from violent * men. 3 Look! They wait to ambush me; * + Strong men attack me But not because I have revolted or sinned, + O Jehovah. 4 Though I did no wrong, they run and prepare to attack. Do arise at my calling and see. 5 For you, O Jehovah God of armies, are the God of Israel. + Awake to turn your attention to all the nations. Do not show mercy to any malicious traitors. + ( Selah ) 6 They return each evening; + They growl * like dogs + and prowl around the city. + 7 Look what pours * forth from their mouth; Their lips are like swords, + For they say: “Who is listening?” + 8 But you, O Jehovah, will laugh at them; + You will scoff at all the nations. + 9 O my Strength, I will keep watch for you; + For God is my secure refuge. * + 10 The God who shows loyal love to me will come to my aid; + God will cause me to look in triumph on my foes. + 11 Do not kill them, so that my people may not forget. By your power make them wander about; Cause their downfall, O Jehovah, our shield. + 12 For the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips, May they be trapped by their pride, + Because of the cursing and deception that they speak. 13 Finish them off in your wrath; + Finish them off, so that they are no more; Make them know that God is ruling in Jacob and to the ends of the earth. + ( Selah ) 14 Let them return in the evening; Let them growl * like dogs and prowl around the city. + 15 Let them wander about for something to eat; + Do not let them be satisfied or find a lodging place. 16 But as for me, I will sing about your strength; + In the morning I will joyfully tell about your loyal love. For you are my secure refuge + And a place for me to flee in my time of distress. + 17 O my Strength, to you I will sing praises, * + For God is my secure refuge, the God who shows loyal love to me. + Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Lit., “the.” ^ Or “bloodthirsty.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “bark.” ^ Or “bubbles.” ^ Or “secure height.” ^ Or “bark.” ^ Or “make music.” Previous Next Print Share Share
