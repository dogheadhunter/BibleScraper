As I pondered, * the fire kept burning. Then my tongue spoke: 4 “O Jehovah, help me to know what my end will be, And the measure of my days, + So that I may know how short my life is. * 5 Indeed, you have made my days just a few; * + And my life span is as nothing before you. + Surely every man, though he seems secure, is nothing but a mere breath. + ( Selah ) 6 Surely every man walks about like a shadow. He rushes around * for nothing. He piles up wealth, not knowing who will enjoy it. + 7 What, then, can I hope for, O Jehovah? You are my only hope. 8 Save me from all my transgressions. + Do not let the foolish one make me an object of contempt. 9 I remained speechless; I could not open my mouth, + Because this was your doing. + 10 Remove your plague from me. I am worn down because your hand strikes me. 11 You correct man with punishment for his error; + You consume the things he treasures just as a moth does. Surely every man is but a mere breath. + ( Selah ) 12 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah, Listen to my cry for help. + Do not ignore my tears. For I am but a foreign resident to you, + A traveler passing through, * just like all my forefathers. + 13 Turn your harsh gaze away from me so that I may cheer up Before I pass away and I am gone.” Footnotes ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “stirred up.” ^ Lit., “grew hot.” ^ Or “sighed.” ^ Or “how transient I am.” ^ Lit., “handbreadths.” ^ Lit., “makes noise.” ^ Or “A settler.” Previous Next Print Share Share
