A melody of David, when Nathan the prophet came in to him after David had relations with Bath-sheʹba. + 51 Show me favor, O God, according to your loyal love. + Blot out my transgressions according to your great mercy. + 2 Thoroughly wash me from my error, + And cleanse me from my sin. + 3 For I am well-aware of my transgressions, And my sin is always before me. * + 4 Against you—you above all * —I have sinned; + What is bad in your eyes I have done. + Therefore, you are righteous when you speak, You are right in your judgment. + 5 Look! I was born guilty of error, And my mother conceived me in sin. * + 6 Look! You find pleasure in truth in the inner person; + Teach my innermost self * true wisdom. 7 Purify me from my sin with hyssop, so that I will be clean; + Wash me, so that I will be whiter than snow. + 8 Let me hear sounds of joy and rejoicing, So that the bones you crushed will rejoice. + 9 Turn your face away * from my sins, + And wipe away * all my errors. + 10 Create in me a pure heart, O God, + And put within me a new spirit, + a steadfast one. 11 Do not cast me out from your presence; And do not take your holy spirit away from me. 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation; + Stir within me a willingness to obey you. * 13 I will teach transgressors your ways, + So that sinners will return to you. 14 Save me from bloodguilt, + O God, the God of my salvation, + So that my tongue may joyfully declare your righteousness. + 15 O Jehovah, open my lips, So that my mouth may declare your praise. + 16 For you do not want a sacrifice—otherwise I would give it; + You do not find delight in a whole burnt offering. + 17 The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit; A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject. * + 18 In your goodwill do what is good for Zion; Build up the walls of Jerusalem. 19 Then you will take delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, The burnt sacrifices and the whole offerings; Then bulls will be offered up on your altar. + Footnotes ^ Or “on my mind.” ^ Lit., “only you.” ^ Or “And sinful from the moment my mother conceived me.” ^ Or “my secret self.” ^ Or “Hide your face.” ^ Or “blot out.” ^ Lit., “May you support me with a willing ­spirit.” ^ Or “despise.” Previous Next Print Share Share
