( Selah ) 6 Rise up in your anger, O Jehovah; Stand up against the fury of my enemies; + Awake for me, and demand that justice be done. + 7 Let the nations surround you; And you will act against them from on high. 8 Jehovah will pass sentence on the peoples. + Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness And according to my integrity. + 9 Please put an end to the evil deeds of the wicked. But establish the righteous, + Since you are the righteous God + who examines the hearts + and the deepest emotions. * + 10 God is my shield, + the Savior of those upright in heart. + 11 God is a righteous Judge, + And God proclaims his judgments * every day. 12 If anyone will not repent, + He sharpens his sword; + He bends his bow and makes it ready. + 13 He prepares his deadly weapons; He makes ready his flaming arrows. + 14 Look at the one who is pregnant with wickedness; He conceives trouble and gives birth to lies. + 15 He excavates a pit and digs it deep, But he falls into the very hole he made. + 16 The trouble he causes will return on his own head; + His violence will fall on the crown of his head. 17 I will praise Jehovah for his justice; + I will sing praises * to the name of Jehovah + the Most High. + Footnotes ^ Or “song of mourning.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or possibly, “While I spared the one opposing me without cause.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “tests the hearts and the kidneys.” ^ Or “hurls denunciations.” ^ Or “make music.” Previous Next Print Share Share
