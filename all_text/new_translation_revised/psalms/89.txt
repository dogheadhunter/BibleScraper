With my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. 2 For I have said: “Loyal love will be built up * forever, + And you have firmly established your faithfulness in the heavens.” 3 “I have made a covenant with my chosen one; + I have sworn to David my servant: + 4 ‘I will firmly establish your offspring * + forever, And I will build up your throne for all generations.’” + ( Selah ) 5 The heavens praise your marvels, O Jehovah, Yes, your faithfulness in the congregation of the holy ones. 6 For who in the skies can compare to Jehovah? + Who among the sons of God + is like Jehovah? 7 God is held in awe in the council * of holy ones; + He is grand and awe-inspiring to all who are around him. + 8 O Jehovah God of armies, Who is mighty like you, O Jah? + Your faithfulness surrounds you. + 9 You rule over the raging of the sea; + When its waves surge, you calm them. + 10 You have crushed Raʹhab + like one who is slain. + With your strong arm you have scattered your enemies. + 11 The heavens are yours, and the earth is yours; + The productive land and what fills it + —you have founded them. 12 The north and the south—you created them; Taʹbor + and Herʹmon + joyously praise your name. 13 Your arm is mighty; + Your hand is strong; + Your right hand is exalted. + 14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; + Loyal love and faithfulness stand before you. + 15 Happy are the people who know the joyful shouting. + O Jehovah, they walk in the light of your face. 16 They rejoice in your name all day long, And in your righteousness they are exalted. 17 For you are the glory of their strength, + And by your approval our strength * is exalted. + 18 For our shield belongs to Jehovah, Our king belongs to the Holy One of Israel. + 19 At that time you spoke in a vision to your loyal ones and said: “I have granted strength to a mighty one; + I have exalted a chosen one from among the people. + 20 I have found David my servant; + With my holy oil I have anointed him. + 21 My hand will support him, + And my arm will strengthen him. 22 No enemy will exact tribute from him, And no unrighteous man will oppress him. + 23 I will crush to pieces his adversaries from before him + And strike down those who hate him. + 24 My faithfulness and loyal love are with him, + And in my name his strength * will be exalted. 25 I will put his hand * over the sea And his right hand over the rivers. + 26 He will call out to me: ‘You are my Father, My God and the Rock of my salvation.’ + 27 And I will place him as firstborn, + The highest of the kings of the earth. + 28 I will maintain my loyal love for him forever, + And my covenant with him will never fail. + 29 I will establish his offspring * forever And make his throne as enduring as the heavens. + 30 If his sons leave my law And do not walk according to my decrees, * 31 If they violate my statutes And do not keep my commandments, 32 Then I will punish their disobedience * with a rod + And their error with flogging. 33 But I will never abandon my loyal love for him + Nor be untrue to my promise. * 34 I will not violate my covenant + Or change what my lips have spoken. + 35 I have sworn in my holiness, once and for all; I will not tell lies to David. + 36 His offspring * will endure forever; + His throne will endure like the sun before me. + 37 Like the moon, it will be firmly established forever As a faithful witness in the skies.” ( Selah ) 38 But you yourself have cast off and rejected him; + You have become furious with your anointed one. 39 You have spurned the covenant with your servant; You have profaned his crown * by throwing it to the ground. 40 You have broken down all his stone walls; * You have reduced his fortifications to ruins. 41 All who pass by have pillaged him; He is a reproach to his neighbors. + 42 You have made his adversaries victorious; * + You have caused all his enemies to rejoice. 43 You have also driven back his sword, And you have made him lose ground in the battle. 44 You have brought an end to his splendor And hurled his throne to the ground. 45 You have cut short the days of his youth; You have clothed him with shame. ( Selah ) 46 How long, O Jehovah, will you hide yourself? Will it be forever? + Will your rage continue to burn like a fire? 47 Remember how short my life is! + Was it to no purpose that you created all humans? 48 What man can live and never see death? + Can he save himself * from the power of the Grave? * ( Selah ) 49 Where are your former acts of loyal love, O Jehovah, That you swore about to David in your faithfulness? + 50 Remember, O Jehovah, the taunts hurled at your servants; How I have to bear * the taunts of all the peoples; 51 How your enemies have hurled insults, O Jehovah; How they have insulted every footstep of your anointed one. 52 May Jehovah be praised forever.
