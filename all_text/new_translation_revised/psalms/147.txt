Praise your God, O Zion. 13 He makes the bars of your city gates strong; He blesses your sons within you. 14 He brings peace to your territory; + He satisfies you with the finest * wheat. + 15 He sends his command to the earth; His word runs swiftly. 16 He sends the snow like wool; + He scatters the frost just like ashes. + 17 He hurls down his hailstones * like morsels of bread. + Who can withstand his cold? + 18 He sends out his word, and they melt. He makes his wind blow, + and the waters flow. 19 He declares his word to Jacob, His regulations and judgments to Israel. + 20 He has not done so with any other nation; + They know nothing about his judgments. Praise Jah! * + Footnotes ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Or “make music.” ^ Lit., “the fat of.” ^ Or “ice.” ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah.
