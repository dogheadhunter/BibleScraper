The eye of Jehovah watches over those fearing him, + Those waiting for his loyal love, 19 To rescue them * from death And to keep them alive during famine. + 20 We are * in expectation of Jehovah. He is our helper and our shield. + 21 Our hearts rejoice in him, For we trust in his holy name. + 22 May your loyal love rest upon us, O Jehovah, + While we keep waiting for you. + Footnotes ^ Or “Make music.” ^ Or “breath.” ^ Lit., “all their army.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “thoughts.” ^ Or “counsel.” ^ Or “for victory.” ^ Or “their soul.” ^ Or “Our soul is.” Previous Next Print Share Share
