You made the light * and the sun. + 17 You set up all the boundaries of the earth; + You made summer and winter. + 18 Remember the enemy’s taunts, O Jehovah, How a foolish people treats your name with disrespect. + 19 Do not surrender the life * of your turtledove to the wild beasts. Do not forget the life of your afflicted people forever. 20 Remember the covenant, For the dark places of the earth have become full of the haunts of violence. 21 May the crushed one not turn away disappointed; + May the lowly and the poor praise your name. + 22 Rise up, O God, and plead your legal case. Remember how the foolish taunt you all day long. + 23 Do not forget what your foes are saying. The uproar of those who defy you is ascending constantly.
