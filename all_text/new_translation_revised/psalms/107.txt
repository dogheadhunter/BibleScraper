Their courage * melts away because of the impending calamity. 27 They reel and stagger like a drunken man, And all their skill proves useless. + 28 Then they cry out to Jehovah in their distress, + And he rescues them from their plight. 29 He calms the windstorm; The waves of the sea grow quiet. + 30 They rejoice when these grow still, And he leads them to their desired harbor. 31 Let people give thanks to Jehovah for his loyal love And for his wonderful works in behalf of the sons of men. + 32 Let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, + And let them praise him in the council * of the elders. 33 He turns rivers into a desert And springs of water into parched ground, + 34 Fruitful land into salty wasteland, + Because of the wickedness of those dwelling in it. 35 He turns the desert into reedy pools of water, And dry land into springs of water. + 36 He causes the hungry to dwell there, + So that they may establish a city where they can live. + 37 They sow fields and plant vineyards + That yield fruitful crops. + 38 He blesses them and they increase greatly; He does not let their cattle diminish. + 39 But again they become few and are humiliated Because of oppression, calamity, and grief. 40 He pours out contempt upon nobles And makes them wander in trackless wastelands. + 41 But he protects * the poor from oppression + And makes their families as numerous as a flock. 42 The upright see this and rejoice; + But all the unrighteous shut their mouths. + 43 Whoever is wise will observe these things + And will carefully consider Jehovah’s acts of loyal love. + Footnotes ^ Or “repurchased.” ^ Or “power.” ^ Or “From sunrise and from sunset.” ^ Or “Their soul was.” ^ Or “the parched soul.” ^ Or “the hungry soul.” ^ Or “Their soul detested.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “seat.” ^ Or “puts on high,” that is, out of reach.
