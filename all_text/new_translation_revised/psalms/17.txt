Incline your ear * to me. Hear my words. + 7 Show your loyal love in a wonderful way, + O Savior of those seeking refuge at your right hand From those who rebel against you. 8 Guard me like the pupil of your eye; + Conceal me in the shadow of your wings. + 9 Guard me from the wicked who attack me, From my mortal enemies * who surround me. + 10 They have become insensitive; * With their mouth they speak arrogantly; 11 Now they hem us in; + They watch for the chance to cause our downfall. * 12 He is like a lion eager to tear its prey to pieces, Like a young lion crouching in ambush. 13 Rise up, O Jehovah, to confront him + and bring him down; Rescue me * from the wicked with your sword; 14 Rescue me with your hand, O Jehovah, From men of this world, * whose share is in this life, + Those whom you fill with the good things you provide + And who leave an inheritance to their many sons. 15 But as for me, in righteousness I will see your face; I am satisfied to awaken in your presence. * + Footnotes ^ Or “Bend down and listen.” ^ Or “my enemies against the soul.” ^ Or “They are enclosed in their own fat.” ^ Or “throw us down to the ground.” ^ Or “my soul.” ^ Or “system of things.” ^ Or “to see your form.” Previous Next Print Share Share
