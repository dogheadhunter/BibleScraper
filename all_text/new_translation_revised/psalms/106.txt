They did not remember your abundant loyal love, But they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea. + 8 But he saved them for the sake of his name, + To make his mightiness known. + 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; He led them through its depths as through a desert; * + 10 He saved them from the hand of their foe + And reclaimed them from the hand of the enemy. + 11 The waters covered their adversaries; Not one of them survived. * + 12 Then they had faith in his promise; + They began to sing his praise. + 13 But they quickly forgot what he did; + They did not wait for his counsel. 14 They gave way to their selfish desires in the wilderness; + They tested God in the desert. + 15 He gave them what they requested, But then struck them with disease that made them * waste away. + 16 In the camp they grew jealous of Moses And of Aaron, + the holy one of Jehovah. + 17 The earth then opened up and swallowed Daʹthan And covered those assembled with A·biʹram. + 18 A fire blazed among their group; A flame consumed the wicked. + 19 They made a calf in Horʹeb And bowed down to a statue of metal; * + 20 They exchanged my glory For the representation of a grass-eating bull. + 21 They forgot God + their Savior, Who did great things in Egypt, + 22 Wonderful works in the land of Ham, + Awe-inspiring deeds at the Red Sea. + 23 He was about to order their annihilation, But Moses his chosen one interceded with him * To avert his destructive anger. + 24 Then they despised the desirable land; + They had no faith in his promise. + 25 They kept grumbling in their tents; + They did not listen to the voice of Jehovah. + 26 So he raised his hand in an oath concerning them That he would make them fall in the wilderness; + 27 He would make their descendants fall among the nations, And he would scatter them throughout the lands. + 28 Then they joined in worship of * Baʹal of Peʹor, + And they ate sacrifices offered to the dead. * 29 They provoked Him by their actions, + And a scourge broke out among them. + 30 But when Phinʹe·has stood up and intervened, The scourge was halted. + 31 And it was counted to him as righteousness Through all generations forever. + 32 They provoked Him at the waters of Merʹi·bah, * And it went badly for Moses because of them. + 33 They embittered his spirit, And he spoke rashly with his lips. + 34 They did not annihilate the peoples, + As Jehovah had commanded them. + 35 But they mingled with the nations + And adopted * their ways. + 36 They kept serving their idols, + And these became a snare to them. + 37 They would sacrifice their sons And their daughters to demons. + 38 They kept spilling innocent blood, + The blood of their own sons and daughters Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Caʹnaan; + And the land was polluted with bloodshed. 39 They became unclean by their works; They committed spiritual prostitution by their deeds. + 40 So the anger of Jehovah blazed against his people, And he grew to detest his inheritance. 41 He repeatedly handed them over to the nations, + So that those who hated them might rule over them. + 42 Their enemies oppressed them, And they were subject to their power. * 43 Many times he rescued them, + But they would rebel and disobey, + And they would be brought low for their error. + 44 But he would see their distress + And hear their cry for help. + 45 For their sake he would remember his covenant, And he would feel pity, * moved by his great * loyal love. + 46 He would cause them to be pitied By all who held them captive. + 47 Save us, O Jehovah our God, + And gather us from the nations + So that we may give thanks to your holy name And exult in praising you. * + 48 May Jehovah, the God of Israel, be praised Throughout all eternity. * + And let all the people say, “Amen!” * Praise Jah! * Footnotes ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah. ^ Or “goodwill.” ^ Or “may boast about.” ^ Or “grasp the meaning of.” ^ Or “wilderness.” ^ Or “was left.” ^ Or “their soul.” ^ Or “molten statue.” ^ Lit., “stood in the breach before him.” ^ Or “attached themselves to.” ^ That is, sacrifices offered either to dead people or to lifeless gods. ^ Meaning “Quarreling.” ^ Or “learned.” ^ Lit., “hand.” ^ Or “feel regret.” ^ Or “abundant.” ^ Or “exult in your praise.” ^ Or “From eternity to eternity.” ^ Or “So be it!” ^ Or “Hallelujah!” “Jah” is a shortened form of the name Jehovah.
