And besides you I desire nothing on earth. + 26 My body and my heart may fail, But God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever. + 27 Truly, those keeping far from you will perish. You will put an end to * everyone who immorally * leaves you. + 28 But as for me, drawing near to God is good for me. + I have made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah my refuge, To declare all your works. + Footnotes ^ Or “boasters.” ^ Or “Their paunch is fat.” ^ Lit., “fat.” ^ Lit., “the generation of your sons.” ^ Lit., “despise.” ^ Lit., “in my kidneys.” ^ Lit., “silence.” ^ Or “unfaithfully.” Previous Next Print Share Share
