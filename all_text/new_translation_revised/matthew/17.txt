If you wish, I will erect three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for E·liʹjah.” 5 While he was still speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and look! a voice out of the cloud said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. + Listen to him.” + 6 At hearing this, the disciples fell facedown and became very much afraid. 7 Then Jesus came near, and touching them, he said: “Get up. Have no fear.” 8 When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus himself. 9 As they were descending from the mountain, Jesus commanded them: “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is raised up from the dead.” + 10 However, the disciples put the question to him: “Why, then, do the scribes say that E·liʹjah must come first?” + 11 In reply he said: “E·liʹjah is indeed coming and will restore all things. + 12 However, I say to you that E·liʹjah has already come, and they did not recognize him but did whatever they wanted with him. + In this way also, the Son of man is going to suffer at their hands.” + 13 Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist. 14 When they came toward the crowd, + a man approached him, knelt down to him, and said: 15 “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and is ill. He falls often into the fire and often into the water. + 16 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him.” 17 In reply Jesus said: “O faithless and twisted generation, + how long must I continue with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me.” 18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. + 19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said: “Why could we not expel it?” 20 He said to them: “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” + 21 * —— 22 It was while they were gathered together in Galʹi·lee that Jesus said to them: “The Son of man is going to be betrayed into men’s hands, + 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.” + And they were very much grieved. 24 After they arrived in Ca·perʹna·um, the men collecting the two drachmas * tax approached Peter and said: “Does your teacher not pay the two drachmas tax?” + 25 He said: “Yes.” However, when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first and said: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive duties or head tax? From their sons or from the strangers?” 26 When he said: “From the strangers,” Jesus said to him: “Really, then, the sons are tax-free. 27 But that we do not cause them to stumble, + go to the sea, cast a fishhook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a silver coin. * Take that and give it to them for me and you.” Footnotes ^ Or “white.” ^ See App. A3 . ^ Lit., “the double drachmas.” See App. B14 . ^ Lit., “stater coin,” considered to be the tetradrachma.
