Every tree, then, that does not produce fine fruit is to be cut down and thrown into the fire. + 11 I, for my part, baptize you with water because of your repentance, + but the one coming after me is stronger than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to take off. + That one will baptize you with holy spirit + and with fire. + 12 His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean up his threshing floor completely and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn up with fire + that cannot be put out.” 13 Then Jesus came from Galʹi·lee to the Jordan to John, in order to be baptized by him. + 14 But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: “I am the one who needs to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?” 15 Jesus replied to him: “Let it be this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” Then he quit preventing him. 16 After being baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water; and look! the heavens were opened up, + and he saw God’s spirit descending like a dove and coming upon him. + 17 Look! Also, a voice from the heavens + said: “This is my Son, + the beloved, whom I have approved.” + Footnotes ^ See App. A5 . ^ Or “dipped; immersed.” Previous Next Print Share Share
