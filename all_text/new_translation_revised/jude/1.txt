Jehovah * came with his holy myriads * + 15 to execute judgment against all, + and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” + 16 These men are murmurers, + complainers about their lot in life, following their own desires, + and their mouths make grandiose boasts, while they are flattering others * for their own benefit. + 17 As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken * by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, 18 how they used to say to you: “In the last time there will be ridiculers, following their own desires for ungodly things.” + 19 These are the ones who cause divisions, + animalistic men, * not having spirituality. * 20 But you, beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith, and pray with holy spirit, + 21 in order to keep yourselves in God’s love, + while you await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view. + 22 Also, continue showing mercy + to some who have doubts; + 23 save them + by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the garment that has been stained by the flesh. + 24 Now to the one who is able to guard you from stumbling and to make you stand unblemished + in the sight of his glory * with great joy, 25 to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority for all past eternity and now and into all eternity. Amen. Footnotes ^ Or “shameless conduct.” Greek, a·selʹgei·a.
