If anyone does any work on it, then that person * must be cut off * from among his people. + 15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of complete rest. + It is something holy to Jehovah. Anyone doing work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. 16 The Israelites must keep the Sabbath; they must observe the Sabbath during all their generations. It is a lasting covenant. 17 It is an enduring sign between me and the people of Israel, + for in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he rested and refreshed himself.’” + 18 Now as soon as he had finished speaking with him on Mount Siʹnai, he gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, + tablets of stone written on by God’s finger. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “called by name.” ^ Lit., “wise of heart.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “put to death.” Previous Next Print Share Share
