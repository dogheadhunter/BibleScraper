I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandment that I will write for their instruction.” + 13 So Moses got up with his attendant Joshua, + and Moses went up the mountain of the true God. + 14 But to the elders he had said: “Wait here for us until we return to you. + You have Aaron and Hur + with you. Whoever has a legal case may go to them.” + 15 Then Moses went up the mountain while the cloud was covering it. + 16 Jehovah’s glory + remained on Mount Siʹnai, + and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day he called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 17 To the Israelites who were watching, the appearance of Jehovah’s glory was like a consuming fire on the mountaintop. 18 Moses then entered into the cloud and went up the mountain. + And Moses stayed on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights. + Footnotes Previous Next Print Share Share
