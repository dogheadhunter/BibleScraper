The faces of the cherubs will be turned toward the cover. 21 You will put the cover + on the Ark, and in the Ark you will place the Testimony that I will give you. 22 I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover. + From between the two cherubs that are on the ark of the Testimony, I will make known to you all that I will command you for the Israelites. 23 “You will also make a table + of acacia wood, two cubits long and a cubit wide and a cubit and a half high. + 24 You will overlay it with pure gold and make a golden border * around it. 25 You will make a rim around it a handbreadth * wide and a border * of gold to go around the rim. 26 You will make for it four rings of gold and place the rings on the four corners, where the four legs are attached. 27 The rings are to be close to the rim as holders for the poles for carrying the table. 28 You will make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold and carry the table with them. 29 “You will also make its dishes, its cups, and its pitchers and bowls from which they will pour drink offerings. You are to make them out of pure gold. + 30 And you will put the showbread on the table before me constantly. + 31 “You will make a lampstand + of pure gold. The lampstand is to be made of hammered work. Its base, its stem, its branches, its cups, its knobs, and its blossoms will be one piece. + 32 And six branches will extend out from the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side and three branches from the other side. 33 Three cups shaped like almond flowers will be on the one set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating, and three cups shaped like almond flowers on the other set of branches, with knobs and blossoms alternating. This is how the six branches will extend out from the stem of the lampstand. 34 On the stem of the lampstand are four cups shaped like almond flowers, with its knobs and its blossoms alternating. 35 A knob will be under the first two branches that extend out of the stem and a knob under the next two branches and a knob under the next two branches, for the six branches extending out from the stem. 36 The knobs and the branches and the whole lampstand are to be one piece of pure, hammered gold. + 37 You will make seven lamps for it, and when the lamps are lit, they will shine on the area in front of it. + 38 Its snuffers * and its fire holders are to be of pure gold. + 39 It should be made, along with these utensils, from a talent * of pure gold. 40 See that you make them after their pattern * that was shown to you on the mountain. + Footnotes ^ Or “wool dyed reddish-purple.” ^ Or “coccus scarlet material.” ^ Or “tabernacle.” ^ Or “design.” ^ Or “chest.” ^ A cubit equaled 44.5 cm (17.5 in.).
