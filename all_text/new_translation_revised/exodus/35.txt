They all presented their offerings * of gold to Jehovah. + 23 And all who had blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and sealskins brought them. 24 All those contributing silver and copper brought Jehovah’s contribution, and all who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it. 25 All the skilled women + spun with their hands, and they brought what they had spun: blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen. 26 And all the skilled women whose hearts impelled them spun the goat hair. 27 And the chieftains brought onyx stones and other stones to be set in the ephʹod and the breastpiece, + 28 and the balsam and the oil for lighting and for the anointing oil + and for the perfumed incense. + 29 All the men and women whose hearts incited them brought something for the work that Jehovah, through Moses, had commanded to be done; the Israelites brought it as a voluntary offering to Jehovah. + 30 Then Moses said to the Israelites: “See, Jehovah has chosen Bezʹal·el the son of Uʹri the son of Hur of the tribe of Judah. + 31 He has filled him with the spirit of God, giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge of every sort of craftsmanship 32 for making artistic designs, for working with gold, silver, and copper, 33 for cutting and setting stones, and for making all kinds of artistic wood products. 34 And he has put it into his heart to teach, he and O·hoʹli·ab + the son of A·hisʹa·mach of the tribe of Dan. 35 He has filled them with skill * + to do all the work of a craftsman, an embroiderer, and a weaver using blue thread, purple wool, scarlet material, and fine linen, and of a loom worker. These men will do every sort of work and prepare every sort of design.
