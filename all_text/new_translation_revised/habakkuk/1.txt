And why do you tolerate oppression? Why are destruction and violence before me? And why do quarreling and conflict abound? 4 So law is paralyzed, And justice is never carried out. For the wicked surround the righteous; That is why justice is perverted. + 5 “Look among the nations and pay attention! Stare in amazement and be astounded; For something will happen in your days That you will not believe even if it is told to you. + 6 For here I am raising up the Chal·deʹans, + The ruthless and impetuous nation. They sweep through vast stretches of the earth To seize homes not theirs. + 7 They are frightening and fearsome. They establish their own justice and authority. * + 8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, And they are fiercer than wolves in the night. + Their warhorses gallop forward; Their horses come from far away. They swoop down like the eagle rushing to feed. + 9 All of them come bent on violence. + The assembling of their faces is like the east wind, + And they scoop up captives like sand. 10 They scoff at kings And laugh at high officials. + They laugh at every fortified place; + They pile up a dirt ramp and capture it. 11 Then they move forward like the wind and pass through, But they will become guilty, + Because they credit their power to their god.” * + 12 Are you not from everlasting, O Jehovah? + O my God, my Holy One, you do not die. * + O Jehovah, you appointed them to execute judgment; My Rock, + you established them for punishment. * + 13 Your eyes are too pure to look on what is evil, And you cannot tolerate wickedness. + Why, then, do you tolerate the treacherous + And keep silent when a wicked man swallows up someone more righteous than he is? + 14 Why do you make man like the fish of the sea, Like creeping things that have no ruler? 15 All of these he * hauls up with a fishhook. He catches them in his dragnet, And he gathers them in his fishing net. That is why he rejoices greatly. + 16 That is why he offers sacrifices to his dragnet And makes sacrifices * to his fishing net; For by them his portion is rich, * And his food is choice. 17 Will he then keep emptying out his dragnet? * Will he go on slaughtering nations without compassion? + Footnotes ^ Possibly meaning “Ardent Embrace.” ^ Or “save.” ^ Or “dignity.” ^ Or possibly, “their power is their god.” ^ Or possibly, “we will not die.” ^ Or “for reproving.” ^ That is, the Chaldean enemy. ^ Or “sacrificial smoke.” ^ Lit., “well-oiled.” ^ Or possibly, “keep drawing his sword?” Previous Next Print Share Share
