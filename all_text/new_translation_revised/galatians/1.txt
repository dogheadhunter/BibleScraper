Amen. 6 I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away * from the One who called you with Christ’s undeserved kindness to another sort of good news. + 7 Not that there is another good news; but there are certain ones who are causing you trouble + and wanting to distort the good news about the Christ. 8 However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond the good news we declared to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, I now say again, Whoever is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed. 10 Is it, in fact, men I am now trying to persuade or God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I would not be Christ’s slave. 11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the good news I declared to you is not of human origin; + 12 for neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it was through a revelation by Jesus Christ. 13 Of course, you heard about my conduct formerly in Juʹda·ism, + that I kept intensely * persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it; + 14 and I was making greater progress in Juʹda·ism than many of my own age in my nation, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers. + 15 But when God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his undeserved kindness, + thought good 16 to reveal his Son through me so that I might declare the good news about him to the nations, + I did not immediately consult with any human; * 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before I was, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus. + 18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem + to visit Ceʹphas, * + and I stayed with him for 15 days. 19 But I did not see any of the other apostles, only James + the brother of the Lord. 20 Now regarding the things I am writing you, I assure you before God that I am not lying. 21 After that I went into the regions of Syria and Ci·liʹcia. + 22 But I was personally unknown to the congregations of Ju·deʹa that were in union with Christ. 23 They only used to hear: “The man who formerly persecuted us + is now declaring the good news about the faith that he formerly devastated.” + 24 So they began glorifying God because of me.
