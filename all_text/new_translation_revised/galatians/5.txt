Therefore, stand firm, + and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery. + 2 See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. + 3 Again I bear witness to every man who gets circumcised that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law. + 4 You are separated from Christ, you who are trying to be declared righteous by means of law; + you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness. 5 For our part, we are by spirit eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith. 6 For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value, + but faith operating through love is. 7 You were running well. + Who hindered you from continuing to obey the truth? 8 This sort of persuasion does not come from the One calling you. 9 A little leaven ferments the whole batch of dough. + 10 I am confident that you who are in union with the Lord + will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is causing you trouble, + whoever he may be, will receive the judgment he deserves. 11 As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the torture stake * + has been eliminated. 12 I wish the men who are trying to unsettle you would emasculate themselves. * 13 You were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use this freedom as an opportunity to pursue fleshly desires, + but through love slave for one another. + 14 For the entire Law has been fulfilled * in one commandment, namely: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” + 15 If, though, you keep on biting and devouring one another, + look out that you do not get annihilated by one another. + 16 But I say, Keep walking by spirit + and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all. + 17 For the flesh is against the spirit in its desire, and the spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do the very things you want to do. + 18 Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, and they are sexual immorality, * + uncleanness, brazen conduct, * + 20 idolatry, spiritism, * + hostility, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, dissensions, divisions, sects, 21 envy, drunkenness, + wild parties, * and things like these. + I am forewarning you about these things, the same way I already warned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit God’s Kingdom. + 22 On the other hand, the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, * kindness, goodness, + faith, 23 mildness, self-control. + Against such things there is no law. 24 Moreover, those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the stake the flesh together with its passions and desires. + 25 If we are living by spirit, let us also go on walking orderly by spirit. + 26 Let us not become egotistical, + stirring up competition with one another, + envying one another.
