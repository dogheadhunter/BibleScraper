They should not take food, nor should they drink any water. 8 Let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast; and let them call out earnestly to God and turn from their evil ways and from the violence they practice. 9 Who knows whether the true God may reconsider * what he intends to do and turn from his burning anger, so that we may not perish?” 10 When the true God saw what they did, how they had turned back from their evil ways, + he reconsidered * the calamity that he said he would bring on them, and he did not bring it. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “a city great to God.” ^ Or “feel regret over.” ^ Or “felt regret over.” Previous Next Print Share Share
