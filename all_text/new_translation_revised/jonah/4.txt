That is why I tried to flee to Tarʹshish + in the first place; for I knew that you are a compassionate * and merciful God, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love, + one who feels grieved over calamity. 3 Now, O Jehovah, please take away my life, * for it is better for me to die than to live.” + 4 Jehovah asked: “Is it right for you to be so angry?” 5 Joʹnah then went out of the city and sat down east of the city. He made a shelter for himself there and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. + 6 Jehovah God then provided a bottle-gourd plant * to grow up over Joʹnah, to give him shade for his head and to relieve his misery. And Joʹnah was very pleased with the bottle-gourd plant. 7 But the true God sent a worm at the break of dawn on the next day, and it attacked the bottle-gourd plant, and it withered. 8 When the sun began to shine, God also sent a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Joʹnah’s head, and he grew faint. He kept asking to die, * and he kept saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.” + 9 God asked Joʹnah: “Is it right for you to be so angry over the bottle-gourd plant?” + At that he said: “I have a right to be angry, so angry that I want to die.” 10 But Jehovah said: “You felt sorry for the bottle-gourd plant, which you did not work for, nor did you make it grow; it grew in one night and perished in one night. 11 Should I not also feel sorry for Ninʹe·veh the great city, + in which there are more than 120,000 men who do not even know right from wrong, * as well as their many animals?” + Footnotes ^ Or “gracious.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or possibly, “castor-oil plant.” ^ Or “that his soul might die.” ^ Or “know their right hand from their left.” Previous Next Print Share Share
