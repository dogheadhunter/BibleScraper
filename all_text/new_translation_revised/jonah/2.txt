How will I gaze again upon your holy temple?’ 5 Waters engulfed me and threatened my life; * + The watery deep closed in on me. Weeds were wrapped around my head. 6 To the bottoms of the mountains I sank down. The bars of the earth were closing upon me forever. But out of the pit you brought up my life, O Jehovah my God. + 7 When my life * was ebbing away, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered. + Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. + 8 Those who are devoted to the worthless idols forsake their source of loyal love. * 9 But as for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will pay. + Salvation is from Jehovah.” + 10 In time Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited Joʹnah out onto the dry land.
