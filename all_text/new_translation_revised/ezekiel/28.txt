I sit on the throne of a god in the heart of the sea.’ + But you are only a man, not a god, Though in your heart you feel that you are a god. 3 Look! You are wiser than Daniel. + No secrets have been hidden from you. 4 You have made yourself wealthy by your wisdom and your discernment, And you keep storing up gold and silver in your treasuries. + 5 Your skillful trading brought you great wealth, + And your heart grew haughty because of your wealth.”’ 6 “‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Because in your heart you feel that you are a god, 7 I am bringing foreigners against you, the most ruthless of the nations, + And they will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom And defile your glorious splendor. + 8 They will bring you down to the pit, * And you will die a violent death in the heart of the open sea. + 9 Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ to the one killing you? You will be a mere man, not a god, in the hand of those defiling you.”’ 10 ‘By the hand of foreigners, you will die the death of the uncircumcised ones, For I myself have spoken,’ declares the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.” 11 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 12 “Son of man, sing a dirge * concerning the king of Tyre, and tell him, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “You were the model of perfection, * Full of wisdom + and perfect in beauty. + 13 You were in Eʹden, the garden of God. You were adorned with every precious stone —Ruby, topaz, and jasper; chrysʹo·lite, onyx, and jade; sapphire, turquoise, + and emerald; And their settings and mountings were made of gold. They were prepared on the day you were created. 14 I assigned you as the anointed covering cherub. You were on the holy mountain of God, + and you walked about among fiery stones. 15 You were faultless in your ways from the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. + 16 Because of your abundant trade, + You became filled with violence, and you began to sin. + So I will cast you out as profane from the mountain of God and destroy you, + O covering cherub, away from the stones of fire. 17 Your heart became haughty because of your beauty. + You corrupted your wisdom because of your own glorious splendor. + I will throw you down to the earth. + I will make you a spectacle before kings. 18 Because of your great guilt and your dishonest trading, you have profaned your sanctuaries. I will cause a fire to break out in your midst, and it will consume you. + I will reduce you to ashes on the earth before all those looking at you. 19 All who knew you among the peoples will stare at you in amazement. + Your end will be sudden and terrible, And you will cease to exist for all time.”’” + 20 And the word of Jehovah again came to me, saying: 21 “Son of man, turn your face toward Siʹdon, + and prophesy against her. 22 You should say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “Here I am against you, O Siʹdon, and I will be glorified in your midst; And people will have to know that I am Jehovah when I execute judgment on her and I am sanctified in her. 23 I will send pestilence into her and blood will flow in her streets. The slain will fall in her midst when the sword comes against her from all sides; And they will have to know that I am Jehovah. + 24 “‘“Then the house of Israel will no longer be surrounded by injurious briars and painful thorns, + those who treat them with scorn; and people will have to know that I am the Sovereign Lord Jehovah.”’ 25 “‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says: “When I regather the house of Israel from among the peoples where they were scattered, + I will be sanctified among them in the eyes of the nations. + And they will dwell on their land + that I gave to my servant Jacob. + 26 They will dwell on it in security + and build houses and plant vineyards, + and they will dwell in security when I execute judgment on all those around them who treat them with scorn; + and they will have to know that I am Jehovah their God.”’” Footnotes ^ Or “grave.” ^ Lit., “were sealing up a pattern.” ^ Or “song of mourning.” Previous Next Print Share Share
