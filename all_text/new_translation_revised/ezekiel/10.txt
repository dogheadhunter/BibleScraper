The first face was the face of the cherub, the second face was the face of a man, * the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. + 15 And the cherubs would rise—they were the same living creatures * that I had seen at the river Cheʹbar + — 16 and when the cherubs moved, the wheels would move alongside them; and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to be high above the earth, the wheels would not turn or move from their side. + 17 When these stood still, they would stand still; and when these rose, they would rise with them, for the spirit operating on the living creatures * was in them. 18 Then the glory of Jehovah + departed from over the threshold of the doorway of the house and stood still over the cherubs. + 19 The cherubs now lifted up their wings and rose from the earth as I watched. The wheels were also alongside them when they departed. They stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. + 20 These were the living creatures * that I had seen under the God of Israel at the river Cheʹbar, + so I came to know that they were cherubs. 21 All four had four faces, four wings, and what appeared to be human hands under their wings. + 22 And the appearances of their faces were like the faces I had seen by the river Cheʹbar. + They would each go straight forward. + Footnotes ^ Or “human.” ^ That is, each of the cherubs. ^ Lit., “it was the living creature.” ^ Lit., “the spirit of the living creature.” ^ Lit., “This is the living creature.” Previous Next Print Share Share
