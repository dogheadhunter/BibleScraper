Each one had his censer in his hand, and the perfumed cloud of incense was ascending. + 12 He said to me: “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each one in the inner rooms where his idols are displayed? * For they are saying, ‘Jehovah is not seeing us. Jehovah has left the land.’” + 13 And he went on to say to me: “You will see detestable things that are even more terrible that they are doing.” 14 So he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Jehovah, and there I saw women sitting and weeping over the god Tamʹmuz. 15 And he further said to me: “Do you see this, O son of man? You will see detestable things that are even more terrible than these.” + 16 So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah. + There at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about 25 men with their backs to the temple of Jehovah and their faces to the east; they were bowing down to the sun in the east. + 17 He said to me: “Son of man, do you see this? Is it a trivial thing for the house of Judah to do these detestable things, to fill the land with violence + and keep offending me? Here they are thrusting out the branch * to my nose. 18 So I will act in rage. My eye will not feel sorry; nor will I feel compassion. + Even though they cry out loudly in my ears, I will not hear them.” + Footnotes ^ A shining alloy of gold and silver. ^ Or “image.” ^ Or “image.” ^ The Hebrew term may be related to a word for “dung” and is used as an expression of contempt. ^ Or “in the inner rooms of his showpiece?” ^ Apparently a branch used in idolatrous worship.
