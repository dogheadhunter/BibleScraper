Do not let your eye feel sorry, and do not feel any compassion. + 6 Old man, young man, virgin, little child, and women you should kill off completely. + But do not go near to any man on whom there is the mark. + You should start from my sanctuary.” + So they started with the elders who were in front of the house. + 7 Then he said to them: “Defile the house and fill the courtyards with the slain. + Go!” So they went out and struck down people in the city. 8 While they were striking them down, I alone was left, and I fell facedown and cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Are you going to destroy all the remaining ones of Israel while you pour out your rage on Jerusalem?” + 9 So he said to me: “The error of the house of Israel and Judah is very, very great. + The land is filled with bloodshed, + and the city is full of corruption. + For they say, ‘Jehovah has left the land, and Jehovah is not seeing.’ + 10 But as for me, my eye will not feel sorry; nor will I show compassion. + The consequences of their way I will bring down on their own head.” 11 Then I saw the man clothed in linen with the inkhorn at his waist bringing back word, saying: “I have done just as you have commanded me.” Footnotes ^ Or “a scribe’s ink holder.” Previous Next Print Share Share
