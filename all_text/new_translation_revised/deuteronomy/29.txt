+ What caused this great, burning anger?’ 25 Then they will say, ‘It was because they abandoned the covenant of Jehovah, + the God of their forefathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. + 26 But they went and served other gods and bowed down to them, gods that they had not known and that he had not permitted them to worship. * + 27 Then Jehovah’s burning anger came against that land by bringing upon it the entire curse written in this book. + 28 Therefore, Jehovah uprooted them from their soil in his anger + and fury and great indignation and deported them to another land, where they are today.’ + 29 “The things concealed belong to Jehovah our God, + but the things revealed belong to us and to our descendants forever, so that we may carry out all the words of this Law. + Footnotes ^ Or “trials.” ^ The Hebrew term may be related to a word for “dung” and is used as an expression of contempt. ^ Lit., “the well-watered one along with the dry one.” ^ Lit., “not apportioned to them.” Previous Next Print Share Share
