I have not violated or neglected your commandments. 14 I have not eaten of it while mourning or removed any of it while unclean or given any of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of Jehovah my God and have done all that you commanded me. 15 Now look down from your holy dwelling, the heavens, and bless your people Israel and the land that you have given us, + just as you swore to our forefathers, + the land flowing with milk and honey.’ + 16 “This day Jehovah your God is commanding you to carry out these regulations and judicial decisions. You must observe them and carry them out with all your heart + and all your soul. * 17 Today you have obtained Jehovah’s declaration that he will become your God as you walk in his ways and observe his regulations, + his commandments, + and his judicial decisions, + and as you listen to his voice. 18 And today Jehovah has obtained your declaration that you will become his people, his special property, * + just as he has promised you, and that you will observe all his commandments 19 and that he will put you high above all the other nations that he has made, + giving you praise and fame and glory as you prove yourself a people holy to Jehovah your God, + just as he has promised.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “fruit.” ^ Or possibly, “perishing.” ^ Lit., “gates.” ^ Or “the orphan.” ^ See Glossary . ^ Or “treasured possession.” Previous Next Print Share Share
