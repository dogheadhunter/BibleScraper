For this great fire may consume us. If we continue hearing the voice of Jehovah our God, we are sure to die. 26 For who is there of all flesh * who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire as we did and yet goes on living? 27 You yourself must go near to hear all that Jehovah our God will say, and you will be the one to tell us all that Jehovah our God says to you, and we will listen and do it.’ + 28 “So Jehovah heard the words you spoke to me, and Jehovah said to me, ‘I have heard the words that this people have spoken to you. All they have said is good. + 29 If only they would always have a heart inclined to fear me + and to keep all my commandments; + then it would go well with them and their sons forever! + 30 Go say to them: “Return to your tents.” 31 But you should stay here with me, and let me tell you all the commandments, the regulations, and the judicial decisions that you should teach to them and that they are to observe in the land that I am giving them to take possession of.’ 32 Now you people should be careful to do just as Jehovah your God has commanded you. + You must not turn to the right or to the left. + 33 You should walk in all the way that Jehovah your God has commanded you, + in order that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will take possession of. + Footnotes ^ Or “in defiance of me.” Lit., “against my face.” ^ Or “representation.” ^ Or “loving-kindness.” ^ Lit., “gates.” ^ Or “and it may go well with you.” ^ Lit., “words.” ^ Or “all mankind.” Previous Next Print Share Share
