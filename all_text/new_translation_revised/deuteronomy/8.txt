He made water flow out of the flinty rock + 16 and fed you with manna + in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known, in order to humble you + and to put you to the test so as to benefit you in the future. + 17 If you should say in your heart, ‘My own power and the strength of my own hand have produced this wealth for me,’ + 18 remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you to make wealth, + in order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers, as it is today. + 19 “If you should ever forget Jehovah your God and you walk after other gods and serve them and bow down to them, I do bear witness against you today that you will surely perish. + 20 Like the nations that Jehovah is destroying before you, that is how you will perish, because you would not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God. + Footnotes ^ Or “wadis of water.” ^ Or “deep water sources.” Previous Next Print Share Share
