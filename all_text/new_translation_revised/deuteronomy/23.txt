When you squat outside, you should dig a hole with it and then cover your excrement. 14 For Jehovah your God is walking about within your camp + to deliver you and to hand over your enemies to you, and your camp must be holy, + so that he does not see anything indecent in you and turn away from accompanying you. 15 “You should not hand over a slave to his master when he escapes from his master and comes to you. 16 He may dwell among you in whatever place he chooses in one of your cities, wherever he likes. You must not mistreat him. + 17 “None of the daughters of Israel may become a temple prostitute, + neither may anyone of the sons of Israel become a temple prostitute. + 18 You must not bring the price paid to a female prostitute or the price paid to * a male prostitute * into the house of Jehovah your God to fulfill a vow, for both of them are something detestable to Jehovah your God. 19 “You must not make your brother pay interest, + whether interest on money, on food, or on anything on which interest may be charged. 20 You may make a foreigner pay interest, + but you must not make your brother pay interest, + so that Jehovah your God may bless you in every undertaking of yours in the land you are going to take possession of. + 21 “If you make a vow to Jehovah your God, + do not be slow about paying it. + For Jehovah your God will surely require it of you; otherwise, it will be a sin on your part. + 22 But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty of sin. + 23 The word of your lips you should keep, + and you must carry out what your own mouth vowed as a voluntary offering to Jehovah your God. + 24 “If you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat enough grapes to satisfy your appetite, * but you should not put any in your container. + 25 “If you go into your neighbor’s field of standing grain, you may pluck the ripe ears with your hand, but you should not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain. + Footnotes ^ Or “call down evil upon.” ^ Or “defiling.” ^ That is, a latrine. ^ Or “the earnings of.” ^ Lit., “a dog.” ^ Or “soul.” Previous Next Print Share Share
