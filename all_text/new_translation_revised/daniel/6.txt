He passed the night fasting and refused any entertainment, * and he could not sleep. * 19 Finally at the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions’ pit. 20 As he got near the pit, he called out to Daniel with a sad voice. The king asked Daniel: “O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are continually serving been able to rescue you from the lions?” 21 Daniel immediately said to the king: “O king, may you live on forever. 22 My God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, + and they have not harmed me, + for I was found innocent before him; nor have I done any wrong to you, O king.” 23 The king was overjoyed, and he commanded that Daniel be lifted up out of the pit. When Daniel was lifted up out of the pit, he was completely unharmed, because he had trusted in his God. + 24 The king then gave an order, and the men who had accused * Daniel were brought, and they were thrown into the lions’ pit, along with their sons and their wives. They had not reached the bottom of the pit before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones. + 25 Then King Da·riʹus wrote to all the peoples, nations, and language groups dwelling throughout the earth: + “May you have abundant peace! 26 I am issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom, people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel. + For he is the living God and he endures forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rulership * is eternal. + 27 He rescues, + saves, and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, + for he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.” 28 So this Daniel prospered in the kingdom of Da·riʹus + and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian. + Footnotes ^ Lit., “the kingdom.” ^ Or “an interdict.” ^ Lit., “mouth.” ^ Or possibly, “no musicians were brought in.” ^ Lit., “his sleep fled from him.” ^ Or “slandered.” ^ Or “sovereignty.” Previous Next Print Share Share
