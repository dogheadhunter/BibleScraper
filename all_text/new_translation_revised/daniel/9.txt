Do open your eyes and see our desolate condition and the city that has been called by your name; for we are not entreating you because of our righteous acts but because of your great mercy. + 19 O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. + O Jehovah, do pay attention and act! Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.” + 20 While I was still speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and making my request for favor before Jehovah my God concerning the holy mountain of my God, + 21 yes, while I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gaʹbri·el, + whom I had previously seen in the vision, + came to me when I was extremely weary at about the time of the evening gift offering. 22 And he gave me understanding, saying: “O Daniel, now I have come to give you insight and understanding. 23 When you began your entreaty the word went out, and I have come to report it to you, because you are someone very precious. * + So consider the matter and understand the vision. 24 “There are 70 weeks * that have been determined for your people and your holy city, + in order to terminate the transgression, to finish off sin, + to make atonement for error, + to bring in everlasting righteousness, + to seal up the vision and the prophecy, * + and to anoint the Holy of Holies. * 25 You should know and understand that from the issuing of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem + until Mes·siʹah * + the Leader, + there will be 7 weeks, also 62 weeks. + She will be restored and rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in times of distress. 26 “And after the 62 weeks, Mes·siʹah will be cut off, * + with nothing for himself. + “And the people of a leader who is coming will destroy the city and the holy place. + And its end will be by the flood. And until the end there will be war; what is decided upon is desolations. + 27 “And he will keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week, he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease. + “And on the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation; + and until an extermination, what was decided on will be poured out also on the one lying desolate.” Footnotes ^ That is, the sacred books. ^ Lit., “shame of face.” ^ Lit., “shame of face.” ^ Lit., “our judges who judged us.” ^ Or “softened the face.” ^ Or “faithfulness.” ^ Or “very desirable; highly esteemed.” ^ That is, weeks of years. ^ Or “the Most Holy.” ^ Lit., “prophet.” ^ Or “the Anointed One.” ^ Or “put to death.” Previous Next Print Share Share
