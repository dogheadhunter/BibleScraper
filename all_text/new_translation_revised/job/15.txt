He has no faith in his holy ones, And even the heavens are not pure in his eyes. + 16 How much less so when a person is detestable and corrupt, + A man who drinks in unrighteousness just like water! 17 I will inform you; listen to me! I will relate what I have seen, 18 What wise men have related from their fathers, + Things they have not hidden. 19 To them alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them. 20 A wicked person suffers torment all his days, Throughout all the years reserved for the tyrant. 21 Terrifying sounds are in his ears; + In a time of peace, marauders attack him. 22 He does not believe that he will escape from darkness; + He is reserved for a sword. 23 He wanders about in search of food * —where is it? He well knows that the day of darkness is at hand. 24 Distress and anguish keep terrifying him; They overpower him like a king ready to launch an attack. 25 For he raises his hand against God himself And tries to defy * the Almighty; 26 He stubbornly rushes against Him, With his thick, strong shield; * 27 His face is covered with fat, And his hips bulge with fat; 28 He resides in cities that will be brought to ruin, In houses where no one will dwell, Which will become heaps of stones. 29 He will not grow rich, and his wealth will not accumulate, Nor will his possessions spread over the land. 30 He will not escape from darkness; A flame will dry up his twig, * And he will pass away by a blast of God’s * mouth. + 31 He should not go astray and trust in what is worthless, For what he gets in exchange will be worthless; 32 It will happen before his day, And his branches will never flourish. + 33 He will be like a vine that shakes off its unripe grapes, And like an olive tree that casts off its blossoms. 34 For the assembly of godless ones * is sterile, + And fire will consume the tents of bribery. 35 They conceive trouble and give birth to what is wicked, And their womb produces deceit.” Footnotes ^ Or “with blustery knowledge.” ^ Or “your error trains your mouth.” ^ Lit., “bread.” ^ Or “tries to prevail against.” ^ Lit., “his thick shield bosses.” ^ That is, any hope of recovery. ^ Lit., “his.” ^ Or “of apostates.” Previous Next Print Share Share
