Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices + for each of them. For Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do. + 6 Now the day came when the sons of the true God * + entered to take their station before Jehovah, + and Satan + also entered among them. + 7 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.” + 8 And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of * my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, * + fearing God and shunning what is bad.” 9 At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? + 10 Have you not put up a protective hedge around him + and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, + and his livestock has spread out in the land. 11 But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” 12 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. * Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence * of Jehovah. + 13 Now on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, + 14 a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” 16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God * fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” 17 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹans + formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” 18 While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house. 19 Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.” 20 At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down 21 and said: “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, And naked I will return. + Jehovah has given, + and Jehovah has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.” 22 In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong. * Footnotes ^ Or “a blameless and upright man.” ^ Possibly meaning “Object of Hostility.” ^ Lit., “500 pairs of cattle.” ^ Lit., “female donkeys.” ^ Or “at the house of each one in his turn.” ^ A Hebrew idiom that refers to angelic sons of God. ^ Lit., “set your heart upon.” ^ Or “a blameless and upright man.” ^ Or “under your control.” ^ Lit., “face.” ^ Or possibly, “Lightning.” ^ Or “ascribe anything improper to God.” Previous Next Print Share Share
