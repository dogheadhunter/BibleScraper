Will they come and say to you, ‘Here we are!’ 36 Who put wisdom within the clouds * + Or gave understanding to the sky phenomenon? * + 37 Who is wise enough to count the clouds, Or who can tip over the water jars of heaven + 38 When the dust pours into a mass And the clods of earth stick together? 39 Can you hunt prey for a lion Or satisfy the appetites of young lions + 40 When they crouch in their lairs Or lie in ambush in their dens? 41 Who prepares food for the raven + When its young cry to God for help And wander about because there is nothing to eat?
