There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, * + fearing God and shunning what is bad. He is still holding firmly to his integrity, + even though you try to incite me against him + to destroy * him for no reason.” 4 But Satan answered Jehovah: “Skin for skin. A man will give everything that he has for his life. * 5 But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” + 6 Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! He is in your hand! * Only do not take his life!” * 7 So Satan went out from the presence * of Jehovah and struck Job with painful boils * + from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 8 And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he was sitting among the ashes. + 9 Finally his wife said to him: “Are you still holding firmly to your integrity? Curse God and die!” 10 But he said to her: “You are talking like one of the senseless women. Should we accept only what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?” + In all of this, Job did not sin with his lips. + 11 Three companions * of Job heard about all the calamities that had come upon him, and each came from his own place—Elʹi·phaz + the Teʹman·ite, Bilʹdad + the Shuʹhite, + and Zoʹphar + the Naʹa·ma·thite. So they agreed to meet together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him. 12 When they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. They began to weep loudly and to rip their garments apart, and they threw dust into the air and onto their heads. + 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great. + Footnotes ^ A Hebrew idiom that refers to angelic sons of God. ^ Lit., “set your heart upon.” ^ Or “a blameless and upright man.” ^ Lit., “swallow.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Or “under your control.” ^ Or “soul.” ^ Lit., “face.” ^ Or “with severe ulcers.” ^ Or “acquaintances.” Previous Next Print Share Share
