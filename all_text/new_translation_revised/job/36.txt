They do not cry for help even when he binds them. 14 They die * while still young, + Spending * their life among male temple prostitutes. + 15 But God * rescues the afflicted during their affliction; He opens their ear when they are oppressed. 16 He draws you away from the brink of distress + To a broad space, free of restriction, + With rich food on your table as consolation. + 17 Then you will be satisfied with the judgment on the wicked, + When judgment is rendered and justice is upheld. 18 But take care that rage does not lead you into spitefulness, * + And do not let a large bribe lead you astray. 19 Would your cry for help Or any of your strenuous efforts keep you from distress? + 20 Do not long for the night, When people vanish from their place. 21 Beware that you do not turn to wrongdoing, Choosing this instead of affliction. + 22 Look! God is exalted in his power; What instructor is like him? 23 Who has directed * his way + Or said to him, ‘What you have done is wrong’? + 24 Remember to magnify his activity, + Of which men have sung. + 25 All mankind has seen it, Mortal man looks on from a distance. 26 Yes, God is greater than we can know; + The number of his years is beyond comprehension. * + 27 He draws up the drops of water; + They condense into rain from his mist; 28 Then the clouds pour it down; + They shower down upon mankind. 29 Can anyone understand the layers of clouds, The thundering from his tent? * + 30 See how he spreads his lightning * + over it And covers the depths * of the sea. 31 By these he sustains * the peoples; He gives them food in abundance. + 32 With his hands he covers the lightning, And he directs it against its target. + 33 His thunder tells about him, Even the livestock tell who * is coming.
