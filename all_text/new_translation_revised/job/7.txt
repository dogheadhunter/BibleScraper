I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in my bitter distress! * + 12 Am I the sea or a sea monster, That you should set a guard over me? 13 When I say, ‘My couch will comfort me; My bed will help ease my misery,’ 14 Then you terrify me with dreams And frighten me with visions, 15 So that I * would choose suffocation, Yes, death rather than this body of mine. * + 16 I loathe my life; + I do not want to go on living. Leave me alone, for my days are like a breath. + 17 What is mortal man that you should concern yourself with him And fix your attention * on him? + 18 Why do you inspect him every morning And test him every moment? + 19 Will you not look away from me And leave me alone long enough to swallow my saliva? + 20 If I have sinned, how could I harm you, the Observer of mankind? + Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you? 21 Why do you not pardon my transgression And excuse my error? For soon I will lie down in the dust, + And you will look for me, but I will be gone.” Footnotes ^ Or “until morning twilight.” ^ Lit., “see good.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
