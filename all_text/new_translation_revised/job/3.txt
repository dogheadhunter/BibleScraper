Let God above show no concern for it; Let no light shine upon it. 5 Let the deepest darkness * reclaim it. Let a rain cloud settle over it. Let whatever darkens the day terrify it. 6 That night—let the gloom seize it; + Let it not rejoice among the days of a year, And let it not enter among the number of the months. 7 Indeed! Let that night become barren; Let no joyful cry be heard in it. 8 Let those who curse the day put a curse on it, Those who are able to awaken Le·viʹa·than. * + 9 Let the stars of its twilight grow dark; Let it wait in vain for daylight, And let it not see the rays of dawn. 10 For it did not close the doors of my mother’s womb; + Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 11 Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I came from the womb? + 12 Why were there knees to receive me And breasts to nurse me? 13 For now I would be lying down undisturbed; + I would be sleeping and at rest + 14 With kings of the earth and their advisers, Who built for themselves places that are now in ruins, * 15 Or with princes who possessed gold, Whose houses were filled with silver. 16 Or why was I not like a hidden miscarriage, Like children who have never seen the light? 17 There even the wicked have ceased from agitation; There the weary are at rest. + 18 There the prisoners are at ease together; They do not hear the voice of the one forcing them to work. 19 Small and great are the same there, + And the slave is set free from his master. 20 Why does he give light to one who is suffering And life to those in bitter distress? * + 21 Why do they long for death, but it does not come? + They dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 22 Those who are rejoicing greatly, Who are happy when they find the grave. 23 Why does he give light to a man who has lost his way, Whom God has hedged in? + 24 For in place of my food comes my sighing, + And my groaning + pours out like water. 25 For what I have dreaded has come upon me, And what I have feared has befallen me. 26 I have had no peace, no quiet, no rest, But trouble keeps coming.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “curse his day.” ^ Or “darkness and death’s shadow.” ^ Understood to refer to the crocodile or some other large, powerful aquatic animal. ^ Or possibly, “who built desolate places for themselves.” ^ Or “those bitter of soul.” Previous Next Print Share Share
