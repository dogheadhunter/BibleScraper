For who can hold back from speaking? 3 True, you have corrected many, And you used to strengthen the weak hands. 4 Your words would raise up anyone stumbling, And you would strengthen those whose knees were buckling. 5 But now it has happened to you, and you are overwhelmed; * It touches you, and you are dismayed. 6 Does your reverence for God not give you confidence? Does your way of integrity + not give you hope? 7 Remember, please: What innocent person has ever perished? When have the upright ever been destroyed? 8 What I have seen is that those who plow * what is harmful And those who sow trouble will reap the same. 9 By the breath of God they perish, And through a blast of his anger they come to an end. 10 The lion roars, and a young lion growls, But even the teeth of strong lions * are broken. 11 A lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of a lion are scattered. 12 Now a word was brought to me in secret, And a whisper of it reached my ear. 13 In troubling thoughts during visions of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, 14 A terrible trembling came upon me, Filling all my bones with dread. 15 A spirit passed over my face; The hair of my flesh bristled. 16 It then stood still, But I did not recognize its appearance. A form was in front of my eyes; There was a calm, and then I heard a voice: 17 ‘Can a mortal man be more righteous than God? Can a man be cleaner than his own Maker?’ 18 Look! He has no faith in his servants, And he finds fault with his angels. * 19 How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, + Who are crushed as easily as a moth! 20 They are completely crushed from morning to evening; They perish forever, and no one takes notice. 21 Are they not like a tent whose cord is pulled out? They die without wisdom. Footnotes ^ Lit., “you become weary.” ^ Or “devise.” ^ Or “maned young lions.” ^ Or “messengers.” Previous Next Print Share Share
