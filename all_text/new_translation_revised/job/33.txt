I must open my mouth; My tongue * must speak. 3 My words declare the uprightness of my heart, + And my lips sincerely tell what I know. 4 God’s own spirit made me, + And the Almighty’s own breath brought me to life. + 5 Reply to me if you are able; Present your arguments before me; take your position. 6 Look! I am just like you before the true God; From the clay I too was shaped. + 7 So no fear of me should terrify you, And no pressure from me should overwhelm you. 8 But you said in my hearing, Yes, I kept hearing these words, 9 ‘I am pure, without transgression; + I am clean, without error. + 10 But God finds reasons to oppose me; He considers me his enemy. + 11 He puts my feet in stocks; He scrutinizes all my paths.’ + 12 But you are not right in saying this, so I will answer you: God is far greater than mortal man. + 13 Why do you complain against Him? + Is it because he did not answer all your words? + 14 For God speaks once and a second time, But no one pays attention, 15 In a dream, a vision of the night, + When deep sleep falls upon people While they sleep in their beds. 16 Then he uncovers their ears + And impresses * his instruction upon them, 17 To turn a person away from wrongdoing + And to protect a man from pride. + 18 God spares his soul * from the pit, * + His life from perishing by the sword. * 19 A person is also reproved by pain on his bed And by the constant distress of his bones, 20 So that his very being * loathes bread, And he * rejects even fine food. + 21 His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones that were hidden now protrude. * 22 His soul * draws near to the pit; * His life to those who bring death. 23 If there is a messenger * for him, One advocate out of a thousand, To tell to man what is upright, 24 Then God shows him favor and says, ‘Spare him from going down into the pit! * + I have found a ransom! + 25 Let his flesh become fresher * than in youth; + Let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.’ + 26 He will entreat God, + who will accept him, And he will see His face with shouts of joy, And He will restore His righteousness to mortal man. 27 That person will declare * to men, ‘I have sinned + and distorted what is right, But I did not receive what I deserved. * 28 He has redeemed my soul * from going into the pit, * + And my life will see the light.’ 29 Indeed, God does all these things Twice, three times, for a man, 30 To bring him * back from the pit, * So that he may be enlightened with the light of life. + 31 Pay attention, Job! Listen to me! Keep silent, and I will continue speaking. 32 If you have something to say, reply to me. Speak, for I want to prove you right. 33 If you have nothing to say, you should listen to me; Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.” Footnotes ^ Lit., “My tongue with my palate.” ^ Lit., “puts a seal on.” ^ Or “life.” ^ Or “grave.” ^ Or “by a weapon (missile).” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Lit., “his life.” ^ Or “are laid bare.” ^ Or “life.” ^ Or “grave.” ^ Or “an angel.” ^ Or “grave.” ^ Or “healthier.” ^ Lit., “sing.” ^ Or possibly, “And it did not profit me.” ^ Or “life.” ^ Or “grave.” ^ Or “his soul.” ^ Or “grave.” Previous Next Print Share Share
