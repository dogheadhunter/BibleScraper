His anger blazed against Job for trying to prove himself * right rather than God. + 3 He was also very angry with Job’s three companions because they could not find an answer but had declared God wicked. + 4 E·liʹhu had been waiting to respond to Job, because they were older than he was. + 5 When E·liʹhu saw that the three men had nothing to say in answer, his anger flared up. 6 So E·liʹhu the son of Barʹa·chel the Buzʹite began to speak, saying: “I am young * And you men are aged. + So I respectfully held back, + And I dared not tell you what I know. 7 I thought, ‘Let age * speak, And let a multitude of years declare wisdom.’ 8 But it is the spirit in people, The breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding. + 9 Age alone does not * make one wise, Nor is it only old men who understand what is right. + 10 So I say, ‘Listen to me, And I will also tell you what I know.’ 11 Look! I have waited for your words; I kept listening to your reasoning + As you searched for things to say. + 12 I paid close attention to you, But none of you could prove Job wrong * Or answer his arguments. 13 So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom; It is God who refutes him, not a man.’ 14 He did not direct his words against me, So I will not reply to him with your arguments. 15 They are dismayed, they have no more answers; They have nothing left to say. 16 I have waited, but they do not continue speaking; They just stand there, with no further answer. 17 So I too will give an answer; I too will tell what I know, 18 For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me. 19 My insides are like wine that has no vent, Like new wineskins ready to burst. + 20 Let me speak so that I can find relief! I will open my lips and give an answer. 21 I will not show partiality to anyone; + Nor will I flatter * any human, 22 For I do not know how to flatter; If I did, my Maker would quickly do away with me.
