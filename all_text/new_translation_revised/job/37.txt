Or has anyone said something that should be communicated to him? + 21 They cannot even see the light, * Though it is bright in the sky, Until a wind passes by and clears away the clouds. 22 Out of the north comes golden splendor; God’s majesty + is awe-inspiring. 23 Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach; + He is great in power, + And he never violates his justice + and abundant righteousness. + 24 Therefore, people should fear him. + For he does not favor any who think that they are wise.” * + Footnotes ^ Lit., “puts a seal on the hand of every human.” ^ Or “of the productive land of the earth.” ^ Lit., “a rod.” ^ Or “commands.” ^ Or “beat out.” ^ That is, of the sun. ^ Lit., “who are wise of heart.” Previous Next Print Share Share
