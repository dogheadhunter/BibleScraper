No, surely he would give me a hearing. + 7 There the upright one could set matters straight with him, And I would be acquitted once and for all by my Judge. 8 But if I go east, he is not there; And I return and I cannot find him. 9 When he is working on the left, I cannot look upon him; Then he turns to the right, but I still do not see him. 10 But he knows the path I have taken. + After he has tested me, I will come out as pure gold. + 11 My feet have closely followed his footsteps; I have kept to his way without deviating. + 12 I have not departed from the commandment of his lips. I have treasured up his sayings + even more than what was required of me. * 13 When he is determined, who can resist him? + When he * wants to do something, he does it. + 14 For he will carry out completely what has been determined * for me, And he has many such things in store. 15 That is why I am anxious because of him; When I think about him, my fear grows. 16 God has made me fainthearted, And the Almighty has made me afraid. 17 But I have not yet been silenced by the darkness Nor by the gloom that has covered my face.
