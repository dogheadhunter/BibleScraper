They are strangers to the light. + 17 For morning is the same as deep darkness for them; They are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness. 18 But they are swiftly carried away by the waters. * Their portion of the land will be cursed. + They will not return to their vineyards. 19 Just as drought and heat take away the melted snow, The Grave * takes away those who have sinned! + 20 His mother * will forget him; the maggot will feast on him. He will be remembered no more. + And unrighteousness will be broken just like a tree. 21 He preys on the barren woman, And mistreats the widow. 22 God * will use his strength to do away with the powerful; Though they may rise up, they have no assurance of life. 23 God * lets them become confident and secure, + But his eyes are on everything they do. * + 24 They are exalted for a little while, then they are no more. + They are brought low + and gathered like everyone else; They are cut off like heads of grain. 25 Now who can prove me a liar Or refute my word?” Footnotes ^ That is, his day of judgment. ^ Or “as a pledge.” ^ Or possibly, “harvest fodder in the field.” ^ Or possibly, “They press out oil among the terrace walls.” ^ Or “souls of the wounded.” ^ Or possibly, “God charges no one with wrong.” ^ Lit., “dig into.” ^ Lit., “He is swift on the surface of the waters.” ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
