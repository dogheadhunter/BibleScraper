Should you not rather mourn, + so that the man who committed this deed should be taken away from your midst? + 3 Although absent in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already judged the man who has done this, as if I were actually with you. 4 When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and knowing that I am with you in spirit along with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5 you must hand such a man over to Satan + for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. + 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven ferments * the whole batch of dough? + 7 Clear away the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, inasmuch as you are free from ferment. * For, indeed, Christ our Passover lamb + has been sacrificed. + 8 So, then, let us keep the festival, + not with old leaven, nor with leaven of badness and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 9 In my letter I wrote you to stop keeping company * with sexually immoral people, * 10 not meaning entirely with the sexually immoral people * of this world + or the greedy people or extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, you would actually have to get out of the world. + 11 But now I am writing you to stop keeping company * + with anyone called a brother who is sexually immoral * or a greedy person + or an idolater or a reviler * or a drunkard + or an extortioner, + not even eating with such a man. 12 For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do you not judge those inside, 13 while God judges those outside? + “Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.” + Footnotes ^ Greek, por·neiʹa. See Glossary . ^ Greek, por·neiʹa.
