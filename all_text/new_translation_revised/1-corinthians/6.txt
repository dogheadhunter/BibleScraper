Is there not one wise man among you who is able to judge between his brothers? 6 Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and before unbelievers at that! 7 Really, it is already a defeat for you when you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? + Why do you not rather let yourselves be defrauded? 8 Instead, you wrong and defraud, and your brothers at that! 9 Or do you not know that unrighteous people will not inherit God’s Kingdom? + Do not be misled. * Those who are sexually immoral, * + idolaters, + adulterers, + men who submit to homosexual acts, + men who practice homosexuality, * + 10 thieves, greedy people, + drunkards, + revilers, * and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom. + 11 And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean; + you have been sanctified; + you have been declared righteous + in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God. 12 All things are lawful * for me, but not all things are advantageous. + All things are lawful for me, but I will not let myself be controlled * by anything. 13 Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will bring both of them to nothing. + The body is not for sexual immorality * but for the Lord, + and the Lord is for the body. 14 But God raised up the Lord + and will also raise us up out of death + through his power. + 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? + Should I, then, take the members of the Christ away and join them to a prostitute? By no means! 16 Do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For “the two,” says he, “will be one flesh.” + 17 But whoever is joined to the Lord is one with him in spirit. + 18 Flee from sexual immorality! * + Every other sin that a man may commit is outside his body, but whoever practices sexual immorality is sinning against his own body. + 19 Do you not know that your body is the temple + of the holy spirit within you, which you have from God? + Also, you do not belong to yourselves, + 20 for you were bought with a price. + By all means, glorify God + in your body. + Footnotes ^ Or “men who have sex with men.” Lit., “men who lie with men.” ^ See Glossary , “Sexual immorality.” ^ Or “deceived.” ^ Or “the verbally abusive.” ^ Or “permissible.” ^ Or “brought under authority.” ^ Greek, por·neiʹa.
