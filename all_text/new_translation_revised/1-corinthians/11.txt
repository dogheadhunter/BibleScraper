For her hair is given to her instead of a covering. 16 However, if anyone wants to argue in favor of some other custom, we have no other, nor do the congregations of God. 17 But while giving these instructions, I do not commend you, because it is, not for the better, but for the worse that you meet together. 18 For first of all, I hear that when you come together in a congregation, divisions exist among you; and to an extent I believe it. 19 For there will certainly also be sects among you, + so that those of you who are approved may also become evident. 20 When you come together in one place, it is not really to eat the Lord’s Evening Meal. + 21 For when you eat it, each one takes his own evening meal beforehand, so that one is hungry but another is intoxicated. 22 Do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the congregation of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed? What can I say to you? Should I commend you? In this I do not commend you. 23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night + on which he was going to be betrayed took a loaf, 24 and after giving thanks, he broke it and said: “This means my body, + which is in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” + 25 He did the same with the cup + also, after they had the evening meal, saying: “This cup means the new covenant + by virtue of my blood. + Keep doing this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” + 26 For whenever you eat this loaf and drink this cup, you keep proclaiming the death of the Lord, until he comes. 27 Therefore, whoever eats the loaf or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord. 28 First let a man approve himself after scrutiny, + and only then let him eat of the loaf and drink of the cup. 29 For the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment against himself. 30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and quite a few are sleeping in death. * + 31 But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged. 32 However, when we are judged, we are disciplined by Jehovah, * + so that we may not become condemned with the world. + 33 Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it, wait for one another. 34 If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together it is not for judgment. + But as for the remaining matters, I will put them in order when I get there.
