If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But now God has arranged each of the body members just as he pleased. 19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? 20 But now they are many members, yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” or again, the head cannot say to the feet, “I do not need you.” 22 On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are necessary, 23 and the parts of the body that we think to be less honorable we surround with greater honor, + so our unseemly parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 whereas our attractive parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that had a lack, 25 so that there should be no division in the body, but its members should have mutual concern for one another. + 26 If one member suffers, all the other members suffer with it; + or if a member is glorified, all the other members rejoice with it. + 27 Now you are Christ’s body, + and each of you individually is a member. + 28 And God has assigned the respective ones in the congregation: first, apostles; + second, prophets; + third, teachers; + then powerful works; + then gifts of healings; + helpful services; abilities to direct; + different tongues. + 29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform powerful works, do they? 30 Not all have gifts of healings, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? + Not all are interpreters, * are they? + 31 But keep striving for * the greater gifts. + And yet I will show you a surpassing way. + Footnotes ^ That is, unbelievers. ^ Or “operations.” ^ Or “a message.” ^ Or “languages.” ^ Or “translators.” ^ Or “keep zealously seeking.” Previous Next Print Share Share
