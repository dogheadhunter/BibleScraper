So, too, no one has come to know the things of God except the spirit of God. 12 Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit that is from God, + so that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. 13 These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, + but with those taught by the spirit, + as we explain * spiritual matters with spiritual words. 14 But a physical man does not accept * the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually. 15 However, the spiritual man examines all things, + but he himself is not examined by any man. 16 For “who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, * so that he may instruct him?” + But we do have the mind of Christ. + Footnotes ^ Or “this age.” See Glossary . ^ Or “this age.” See Glossary . ^ Or “executed on the stake.” ^ Or “combine.” ^ Or “receive.” ^ See App. A5 .
