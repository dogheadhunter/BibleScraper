Then if I found you outside, I would kiss you, + And no one would despise me. 2 I would lead you; I would bring you into the house of my mother, + She who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, The fresh juice of pomegranates. 3 His left hand would be under my head, And his right hand would embrace me. + 4 I put you under oath, O daughters of Jerusalem: Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me until it feels inclined.” + 5 “Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her dear one?” “Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you. There she who gave birth to you was in labor. 6 Place me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm, For love is as strong as death is, + And exclusive devotion is as unyielding as the Grave. * Its flames are a blazing fire, the flame of Jah. * + 7 Surging waters cannot extinguish love, + Nor can rivers wash it away. + If a man would offer all the wealth of his house for love, It * would be utterly despised.” 8 “We have a little sister, + And she has no breasts. What will we do for our sister On the day when she is spoken for?” 9 “If she is a wall, We will build upon her a battlement of silver, But if she is a door, We will board her up with a cedar plank.” 10 “I am a wall, And my breasts are like towers. So in his eyes I have become As one who finds peace. 11 Solʹo·mon had a vineyard + in Baʹal-haʹmon. He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each one would bring in a thousand pieces of silver for its fruit. 12 I have my own vineyard at my disposal. The thousand pieces of silver * belong to you, O Solʹo·mon, And two hundred to those who care for its fruit.” 13 “O you who are dwelling in the gardens, + The companions listen for your voice. Let me hear it.” + 14 “Hurry, my dear one, And be swift like a gazelle + Or a young stag Upon the mountains of spices.” Footnotes ^ Or “Sheol,” that is, the common grave of mankind.
