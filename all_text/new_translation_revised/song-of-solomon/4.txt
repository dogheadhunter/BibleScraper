You are beautiful, my beloved. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats Streaming down the mountains of Gilʹe·ad. + 2 Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep That have come up from being washed, All of them bearing twins, And not one has lost her young. 3 Your lips are like a scarlet thread, And your speech is delightful. Like a segment of pomegranate Are your cheeks * behind your veil. 4 Your neck + is like the tower of David, + Built with courses of stone Upon which are hung a thousand shields, All the circular shields of the mighty men. + 5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, The twins of a gazelle, + That feed among the lilies.” 6 “Until the day grows breezy * and the shadows flee, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense.” + 7 “You are altogether beautiful, my beloved, + There is no blemish in you. 8 Come with me from Lebʹa·non, my bride, Come with me from Lebʹa·non. + Descend from the peak of A·maʹnah, * From the peak of Seʹnir, the peak of Herʹmon, + From the lairs of lions, from the mountains of leopards. 9 You have captured my heart, + my sister, my bride, You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes, With one pendant of your necklace. 10 How beautiful your expressions of affection are, + my sister, my bride! Your expressions of affection are far better than wine, + And the fragrance of your perfume than any spice! + 11 Your lips, my bride, drip with comb honey. + Honey and milk are under your tongue, + And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebʹa·non. 12 My sister, my bride, is like a locked garden, A locked garden, a spring sealed shut. 13 Your shoots * are a paradise * of pomegranates With the choicest fruits, with henna along with spikenard plants, 14 Spikenard + and saffron, cane * + and cinnamon, + With all sorts of trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, + Along with all the finest perfumes. + 15 You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water, And flowing streams from Lebʹa·non. + 16 Awake, O north wind; Come in, O south wind. Breathe * upon my garden. Let its fragrance spread.” “Let my dear one come into his garden And eat its choicest fruits.” Footnotes ^ Or “temples.” ^ Lit., “the day breathes.” ^ Or “Anti-Lebanon.” ^ Or possibly, “skin.” ^ Or “garden.” ^ An aromatic reed. ^ Or “Blow gently.” Previous Next Print Share Share
