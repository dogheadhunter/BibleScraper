The king has brought me into his interior rooms! Let us be joyful and rejoice in you. Let us praise * your expressions of affection more than wine. Rightly they * love you. 5 I am dark, * but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, Like the tents of Keʹdar, + like the tent cloths + of Solʹo·mon. 6 Do not stare at me because I am swarthy, Because the sun has gazed upon me. The sons of my mother were angry with me; They appointed me the keeper of the vineyards, But my own vineyard I did not keep. 7 Tell me, you whom I love * so much, Where you pasture your flock, + Where you have them lie down at midday. Why should I be like a woman wrapped in a veil * Among the flocks of your companions?” 8 “If you do not know, O most beautiful of women, Go follow the tracks of the flock And pasture your young goats next to the tents of the shepherds.” 9 “I liken you, my beloved, to a * mare among the chariots of Pharʹaoh. + 10 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, * Your neck with strings of beads. 11 We will make for you gold ornaments * Studded with silver.” 12 “While the king sits at his round table, My perfume * + gives off its fragrance. 13 My dear one is to me like a fragrant bag of myrrh + Spending the night between my breasts. 14 My dear one is to me like a cluster of henna + Among the vineyards of En-gedʹi.” + 15 “Look! You are beautiful, my beloved. Look! You are beautiful. Your eyes are those of doves.” + 16 “Look! You are beautiful, * my dear one, and delightful. + Our bed is among the foliage. 17 The beams of our house * are cedars, Our rafters are juniper trees.
