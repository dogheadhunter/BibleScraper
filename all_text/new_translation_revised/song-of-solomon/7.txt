The curves of your thighs are like ornaments, The work of an artisan’s hands. 2 Your navel is a round bowl. May it never lack mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, Encircled by lilies. 3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, The twins of a gazelle. + 4 Your neck + is like an ivory tower. + Your eyes + are like the pools in Heshʹbon, + By the gate of Bath-rabʹbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebʹa·non, Which looks toward Damascus. 5 Your head crowns you like Carʹmel, + And the locks of your hair * + are like purple wool. + The king is captivated * by the flowing tresses. 6 How beautiful you are, and how pleasant you are, O beloved girl, above all exquisite delights! 7 Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are like date clusters. + 8 I said, ‘I will climb the palm tree To take hold of its stalks of fruit.’ May your breasts be like clusters of grapes, Your breath as fragrant as apples, 9 And your mouth * like the best wine.” “May it go down smoothly for my dear one, Softly flowing over the lips of those asleep. 10 I am my dear one’s, + And his desire is for me. 11 Come, O my dear one, Let us go out to the fields; Let us lodge among the henna plants. + 12 Let us rise early and go to the vineyards To see if the vine has sprouted, * If the blossoms have opened, + If the pomegranates are in bloom. + There I will express my affection for you. + 13 The mandrakes + give off their fragrance; At our doors are all sorts of choice fruits. + The new as well as the old, O my dear one, I have kept in store for you.
